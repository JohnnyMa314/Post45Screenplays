           We hear a disturbing sound in the distance.  It grows as it 
           approaches but we can’t make out where it’s coming from.

                                                              CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           We’re a few thousand feet above the ocean.  The SOUND grows 
           stronger, getting closer and closer, until...

           ROAR!

           A large commercial airplane thunders pas and speeds off, 
           arrogantly disturbing the peaceful quiet of the sea.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Silence inside the cabin.  We see passengers of all races and 
           ages as we advance down the aisle.

           A JAPANESE FAMILY is sleeping peacefully.  Mother and son 
           rest their heads on the shoulders of the sleeping father. 

           An ELDERLY COUPLE looking out the window, holding hands 
           sweetly.

           A couple of NEWLYWEDS watch the in-flight movie on separate 
           monitors.

           We see a woman’s hand turn the page of a book.  The page 
           comes loose.  It’s MARIA (37), a small woman with a look in 
           her eye that suggests both sensitivity and a hot temper.

           Beside her we see SIMON (5), huge eyes and always smiling. 
           His hands play with assorted small plastic toy animals 
           situated on the tray before him.  Sitting by the window 
           beside him is Henry (40), tall and friendly-looking, checking 
           something on his laptop. 

                                 HENRY
                        Did you turn off the heating before 
                        we left?

                                 MARIA
                        Of course I did.  It’s the last 
                        thing I did.

           Henry thinks a moment.
                                 HENRY
                        But you left the house before I 
                        did.  And it was still on when I 
                        walked out.

                                 MARIA
                            (firmly)
                        No, I was the last one out.

                                 HENRY
                        No, I was.  That means it’s still 
                        on!

           Maria shuts her book. 

                                 MARIA
                        Then the house will be nice and 
                        warm when we get back.

           Henry smiles and looks at his laptop.  Maria watches Simon.

           Simon has lined up a dinosaur, a mother kangaroo with a baby 
           kangaroo in its pouch, a tiger and a monkey on his tray.  
           Suddenly turbulence shakes the tray, knocking over all the 
           toy animals.  Simon giggles, a giggle that could make anybody 
           laugh.  Maria grasps the side of her seat tightly.  Henry 
           looks at her.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I hate this part. 

           Simon picks up his toy animals and situates them on his tray 
           again.  He gives his father a tug on the sleeve. 

                                 SIMON
                        There, Dad.   I bet you know who 
                        you are. 

                                 HENRY
                        Hold on, Simon. 

           Maria looks over. 

                                 MARIA
                        What game is that, Simon?

                                 SIMON
                        You have to guess which animal you 
                        are.

                                 MARIA
                        Let’s see...I must be the mommy 
                        kangaroo.
           Henry looks over as well.

                                 HENRY
                        And you must be the monkey, because 
                        you’re always hanging all over me 
                        like a little monkey.

           Simon nods and giggles.

                                 MARIA
                        And Daddy must be the dinosaur.

                                 SIMON
                        The Tyrannosaurus.

           Henry turns from his laptop and smiles.  Simon points at the 
           tiger.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        And this is Lucas because Thomas 
                        always says that when he takes off 
                        his shoes they always smell like a 
                        tiger peed in them.

           Maria smiles and points at the animals. 

                                 HENRY
                        What about Thomas?  Thomas doesn’t 
                        get an animal?

           Simon points at the baby kangaroo in the mother’s pouch. 
           Henry crinkles his brow.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        That isn’t right.  Thomas should 
                        have his own animal.

           More turbulence.  Maria’s smile disappears. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentleman, we are about 
                        to begin our descent to Phuket 
                        Airport.  The local time is 1:30 in 
                        the afternoon and the temperature 
                        is 100 degrees with clear skies.  
                        We ask that you please fasten your 
                        seatbelts and return your seats to 
                        the upright position.

           We hear mumbling and people fastening their seatbelts.

                                 MARIA
                        Time to put your toys away, Simon.
           Maria closes Simon’s tray and fastens his seat belt. THOMAS 
           (7), responsible-looking but also with a worries look on his 
           face, appears from a few seats back.  Maria and Henry look at 
           him, surprised. 

                                 THOMAS
                        I don’t want to sit in the back. 

                                 MARIA
                        Thomas, we’re about to land.  You 
                        have to go sit down. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Lucas is ignoring me.  One of you 
                        guys change with me. 

           Maria looks at Henry, unfastens her seat belt and accompanies 
           Thomas back to his seat. 

           Maria leads Thomas a few rows back.  A Thai stewardess is 
           sitting at the end of the aisle. 

           Thomas stands beside the seat where Lucas (11) is sitting. 
           Lucas has a surprisingly adult look about him.  He’s wearing 
           earphones and watching his monitor. 

                                 MARIA
                        Lucas.

           He takes off his earphones.

                                 LUCAS
                        What?

                                 MARIA
                        You could pay a little more 
                        attention to your brother...He’s 
                        scared.

                                 THOMAS
                        I’m not scared.

                                 LUCAS
                        Everything scares you.  You’re a 
                        scaredy-cat. 

                                 THOMAS
                        I’m not a scaredy-cat. You’re a 
                        midget-hater.

                                 LUCAS
                        Chicken.
                                 MARIA
                        Lucas!

           The stewardess walks over and gestures for Maria to return to 
           her seat.  Maria fastens Thomas’ seat belt and addresses 
           Lucas. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        He’s your little brother, Lucas. 
                        You should protect him and quit 
                        picking on him.

           Maria turns to the stewardess.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           Maria glances at Lucas sharply and returns to her seat.

           Henry is putting his things in his bag.  His daily planner, 
           Blackberry and laptop. 

                                 HENRY
                        Everything okay?

                                 MARIA
                        Everything okay.

           Henry’s backpack has a tiny lock hanging from the zipper.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I wish I could lock that thing and 
                        throw away the key...

           Henry smiles, but something is on his mind.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m done.  I was thinking about 
                        buying that house...

                                 MARIA
                        Don’t think so much.  We’re on 
                        vacation. 

           Maria looks at Henry intensely.  They share a long silence. 
           This vacation means a lot to them. And they need the time 
           together.  Henry smiles. 

           Strong turbulence shakes the plane.  Maria jumps in her seat.  
           Simon giggles in such a manner that several passengers can’t 
           help but laugh out loud.
           EXT. RUNWAY - DAY

           The wheels of the plane land ferociously.

           INT. PHUKET INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           A sign welcomes tourists in several messages.

           Passengers of different nationalities line up across from a 
           series of counters.  The Bennett family is waiting in line. 
           It’s their turn.  Henry is carrying Simon on his shoulders 
           like a little monkey.  Lucas takes a step forward, away from 
           his family.

                                 LUCAS
                        I can go alone.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re coming with us. 

           Henry steps forward and hands the IMMIGRATION EMPLOYEE their 
           documentation.  The employee opens a passport and thumbs 
           through the pages.  He looks at Henry. 

                                 IMMIGRATION EMPLOYEE
                        Henry Bennett.  London.  Mexico.  
                        Spain.  Japan.  You travel a lot. 

                                 HENRY
                        Business, not pleasure...Believe 
                        me.

                                 IMMIGRATION EMPLOYEE
                        Managing director.  Three children.

           Henry nods and smiles. 

           Simon stares at the immigration employee, a Thai man with a 
           slight trace of moustache wearing make-up with a feminine 
           hairstyle.  His fingernails are painted red.  Simon kicks 
           Thomas.  The man delicately checks the other passports, 
           looking at them.

                                 IMMIGRATION EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
                        So it say you are a doctor, lady.

                                 MARIA
                        Oh, that was a long time ago...Now 
                        I take care of my kids. 

                                 IMMIGRATION EMPLOYEE
                        Is that a job?
                                 MARIA
                        Oh, yeah.  It’s much harder than 
                        being a doctor.  But the money 
                        isn’t as good.

           The man smiles.  He stamps the passports and returns them.  
           He gives them a traditional Thai salute.

                                 IMMIGRATION EMPLOYEE
                        Welcome to Thailand.

           The children smile, surprised by the gesture. 

                                 MARIA
                        Thank you, ma’am.

                                 SIMON
                            (simultaneously)
                        Thank you, sir. 

                                 MARIA
                        Simon!

           Henry keeps from smiling.

           INT. HOTEL VAN - DAY

           A DRIVER IN A UNIFORM drives the family across a lush, green 
           landscape.  Lucas looks out the window at the small houses, 
           street vendors, a blind singer, the houses of spirits on 
           every home... He turns through the pages of a guidebook as 
           Maria turns and finds Henry, Thomas and Simon all fast asleep 
           in the back seat. 

           Maria looks out the window to her right.  We see the sea 
           between the palm trees.  It looks calm. 

           EXT. ORCHID BEACH RESORT - EVENING

           The family gets out of the van.  They look tired.  There is a 
           stone wall with the name of the hotel outside across from 
           steps leading to reception.  A HOTEL EMPLOYEE in a uniform 
           greets them and bows. 

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        Welcome to the Orchid Beach Resort.
           INT./EXT. BUNGALOW, ORCHID BEACH RESORT - EVENING

           The door opens in a dark room.  We see the family enter 
           behind the employee.  We can see the garden from the door. 
           Maria looks uneasy. 

                                 MARIA
                        I’m sorry, but we booked a family 
                        room on the third floor...

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        I know, we’re sorry.  There was a 
                        mistake, all rooms were taken, but 
                        we feel...

           The employee opens the curtains.  We see we’re in a 
           beachfront bungalow with the sea right outside.

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
                        ...you might like this better. 

           Lucas and Simon look at each other enthusiastically. 

           Henry looks around, walks outside and checks out the view. 
           Empty beach, palm trees and sunshine.  The little piece of 
           paradise they were looking for is finally here.

           We see the bungalow and the hotel behind, this time from the 
           sea, which now dominates the shot.  We can see the Bennett 
           family in the distance, exploring the bungalow. 

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
                        Breakfast is served from 6:30 to 
                        10:00.  Dinner is served at 19:00.  
                        Tonight we have special Christmas 
                        dinner, you come?

           The employee hands Maria a flyer with a photograph of a group 
           of dancers in traditional Thai costumes and other photos of 
           tourists wearing Christmas party hats.  Maria doesn’t look 
           very enthusiastic. 

                                 MARIA
                        We’re really tired.  It’s been a 
                        long trip... I think we need some 
                        sleep.

           Thomas removes a plastic wrapper still covering one of the 
           light switches on the wall.  Simon opens a small closet with 
           sneakers, bathrobes and umbrellas with the hotel logo printed 
           on them.  He looks at the bed, which is decorated with 
           several orchids and two towels coiled in the shape of swans 
           and wrapped together in the form of a heart. 
                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        It’s okay.  We party every night. 
                        There’s always dancing.  You like 
                        dancing?

           He smiles sarcastically.

                                 HENRY
                        We LOVE dancing.

           IN the bathroom, Simon inspects a small hose by the toilet. 
           He looks at it strangely and picks it up, spraying Lucas, who 
           giggles playfully.

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        If you need anything, just dial 
                        zero.

           Lucas explores the minibar as Maria looks at his wet shirt 
           curiously.

                                 LUCAS
                        Can I have a Coca-Cola?

                                 MARIA
                        Lucas, if you’re thirsty...

           Lucas, Thomas and Simon all chime in together.

                                 LUCAS, THOMAS, AND SIMON
                        ...drink some juice or a glass of 
                        water.

                                 MARIA
                            (to the employee)
                        Listen, this is great.  Thank you 
                        so much. 

           The employee smiles, waiting for a tip.  Henry takes a bill 
           out of his wallet and hands it to him. 

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        Khob kun krup.

           The employee greets them the Thai way, putting his hands 
           together and bowing.  The three boys mimic the gesture 
           mockingly. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM, BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           The bungalow is quiet, dark.  The wind blows, shaking the 
           leaves of palm trees outside, visible through the windows. 
           Thomas can’t sleep. 
           Simon sleeps with his legs wide open, Lucas is uncovered.  
           The roof creaks.  Thomas takes refuge under the sheets. 
           Suddenly, another noise.

           Thomas gets up, walks over to Lucas’ bed and quietly gets 
           into it.  Lucas kicks him out without waking up. 

           Thomas goes back to his bed.  A clock reads 2:15 A.M.

                                                              CUT TO:

           3:50 A.M.  Thomas is still awake, sitting up in his bed.  He 
           sneaks over to Lucas and quietly gets into bed with him.  
           Lucas pushes him off again and he falls to the floor. 

           INT. MARIA AND HENRY’S BEDROOM, BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           The wind continues to blow.  Their clock reads 4:20 A.M.  
           Maria can’t sleep.  Thomas walks in. 

                                 THOMAS
                        I can’t sleep.

           Maria looks at him, lifts the sheets and pats the mattress 
           beside her.  Thomas gets in bed with her. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        It must be jet lag.

           Maria smiles. 

           INT. BUNGALOW - DAY

           A video camera signal appears on screen.  We sneak quietly 
           towards the bed where Maria and Thomas are sleeping.  We can 
           hear Henry trying not to laugh in the background as his hand 
           enters the frame and taps Thomas on the shoulder. 

                                 HENRY
                        Wake up, wake up...

           Thomas lazily turns over and keeps sleeping.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what day it is?

           Thomas opens his eyes, very nervous.  He sits up and 
           immediately jumps out of bed.  Henry chases him through the 
           corridor and outside onto the porch, where we see a pile of 
           gifts.  Thomas starts jumping and shouting.
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Quick, go wake up Lucas and Simon.

           Thomas rushes off in the direction of their bedroom.

                                 THOMAS
                        Santa Claus came!

           Lucas stretches lazily as Simon quickly sits up.

                                 SIMON
                        How did he know we were in 
                        Thailand?

           Simon hurries out to the porch.  Henry follows him with the 
           video camera.

           Simon opens a gift.  It’s a red ball.  He kicks it and it 
           flies against the wall.  It bounces and hits the camera.  We 
           hear laughter as Thomas and Lucas appear.

           Thomas opens a gift.  It’s a large book about Astronomy with 
           incredible photos of stars and constellations. 

           Lucas opens a gift.  New cross trainers.  He smiles 
           enthusiastically.

           Maria unwraps a small box and takes out a silk scarf.  Henry 
           unwraps a set of beach paddles. 

           Simon finds a letter left by Santa Claus resting beside some 
           unopened gifts.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Santa Claus left a letter, look!

           Simon hands the letter to Lucas, who smiles as he reads.

                                 LUCAS
                        Let’s see. “Dear Simon...”
                            (looks at the camera)
                        This guy Santa Claus has some 
                        pretty sloppy handwriting...
                            (continues reading) 
                        “I know your parents agreed to 
                        trade this year’s presents for a 
                        vacation in Thailand.  I have 
                        decided, however, that since you 
                        have all been so good, I’ll give 
                        each of you one gift to enjoy on 
                        your trip.  Unfortunately I ran 
                        into some difficulty...”

           The camera finds Simon, who reacts with amazement.
                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        “...and a heavy storm tipped over 
                        my sleigh.  One of your presents 
                        was lost in the snow.”

           Simon reacts with amazement.

                                 SIMON
                        The Star Wars ship...

                                 LUCAS
                        “But don’t worry, my elves are 
                        looking for it...”

           Simon can’t hide his disappointment. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        “...and they’ll send it to you 
                        Federal Express when you get back 
                        from your trip.  Yours truly, Santa 
                        Claus.”

           The camera turns to Maria, who chuckles as Lucas looks slyly 
           at the camera.

           EXT. BOAT - DAY

           Thomas, Lucas and Simon hang over the side of a small 
           motorboat, with their hands in the water.  Maria looks on, 
           somewhat worried. 

                                 MARIA
                            (to Henry)
                        Shouldn’t they be wearing life 
                        vests?

           Henry smiles.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t exaggerate...

           In the background the outline of Phi Phi Island appears.  The 
           boys shout enthusiastically. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Unbelievable!

           Phi Phi Island looms before them, a lush, tropical paradise 
           surrounded by crystal clear waters. 

           Henry hugs Maria.  She smiles.
           EXT. SEA - DAY

           The family snorkels among the rocks, feeding an assortment of 
           tropical fish. 

           EXT. KHO BEACH, PHI PHI ISLAND - EVENING

           Henry, Lucas, Thomas and Simon are fooling around with a 
           soccer ball.  Maria looks on, sitting in the sand.  Lucas 
           scores a goal and celebrates as Henry falls to the ground. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I win!  I’ll race you guys out to 
                        that rock.

                                 HENRY
                        You guys go ahead, Mom and I are 
                        going for a walk.

           The boys run to the water.  Henry and Maria stroll to the far 
           end of the beach, practically free of tourists.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        My oldest son humiliates me... I’m 
                        not a kid anymore.

           Maria smiles.

                                 MARIA
                        What do you mean? Your oldest son 
                        wants to be just like you.

           Henry sighs.

                                 HENRY
                        No, I’m the one who wants to be 
                        just like him.  We’re getting old, 
                        Maria...

           Maria smiles at him softly.  Henry twirls her hair 
           affectionately.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Remember the first time I met your 
                        parents, at the beach house? 

           Maria chuckles.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I hadn’t seen you in three 
                        months... and your father had us 
                        sleeping in separate rooms. 
                                 MARIA
                        At least he let you spend the 
                        night.  Now that was tough to 
                        negotiate... He liked you.

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t know... Sometimes I think 
                        he still hasn’t forgiven me for 
                        taking you away from England and 
                        doing all this globe-trotting. 

           Henry looks at her with love in his eyes.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Remember that night we snuck out 
                        and went skinny-dipping?

           She looks at him.

                                 MARIA
                        How could I forget?  I’ve never 
                        been so cold in my whole life. 

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah?  I don’t remember it being 
                        cold...

           Henry chuckles.  Maria laughs as well and keeps talking. 

                                 MARIA
                        I still remember the bags under my 
                        dad’s eyes the next morning.  I 
                        think we traumatized him for life. 

           Henry laughs.  He kisses Maria again and looks around.  There 
           are other people on the beach but they’re far away.  Henry 
           pulls down his trunks.  Maria can’t believe it.

                                 HENRY
                        For old times’ sake.

           Henry runs to the water and dives before anyone realizes.  
           Maria picks up his trunks and runs over. 

                                 MARIA
                        Put those back on.  You can’t do 
                        that here.

           Maria tosses his trunks in his face playfully.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t tell me you’ve turned into 
                        your mother already...
           Henry kisses her.  Maria kisses him back.  They embrace. 

           INT. MARIA’S BEDROOM, BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           An open suitcase on the bed.  Maria is about to get dressed. 

           She checks the wrinkles by her eyes.  She reaches for a dress 
           we can’t see.

           INT. BOYS’ BATHROOM, BUNGALOW - EVENING

           Thomas and Simon are in front of the mirror wearing hotel 
           bathrobes.  Simon is wearing a shower cap and Thomas examines 
           the hotel toiletries.  Creams, toothbrushes and a sponge for 
           shining shoes. 

           Beside them Lucas carefully “uncombs” his hair with gel. 
           Simon nudges Thomas with his elbow and starts copying him. 
           Thomas mimics the gesture.  Finally Lucas looks at them. 

                                 LUCAS
                        What?

                                 THOMAS
                            (very serious)
                        Nothing, nothing.

                                 SIMON
                        You’re gorgeous, Lucas. 

           Lucas tries to smack one of them but Thomas and Simon flee, 
           laughing their heads off. 

           INT. MARIA’S BEDROOM, BUNGALOW - EVENING

           The three brothers rush in and stop cold, with surprised 
           looks on their faces. 

           Maria is standing before the terrace, wearing a beautiful 
           green dress with poinsettia on the flap.  She looks gorgeous.  
           At that moment Henry walks in, wearing shorts, flip flops and 
           a T-shirt.

                                 HENRY
                        Hey, what is this?

           Maria points at the flower and her dress. 

                                 MARIA
                        Red and green.  After all, it’s 
                        Christmas.
           EXT. HOTEL TERRACE - NIGHT

           The Christmas dinner.  A crowd of tourists seated around 
           large tables.  Hundreds of light bulbs soften the atmosphere.  
           There’s a band playing on the stage in front, playing “Silent 
           Night.”  The camera pans across the crowd, singing the song 
           in their respective languages. 

                                 TOURISTS
                            (singing) 
                        “Silent night. Holy night”.
                            (in German)
                        “Alles schläft; einsam wacht”.
                            (in Swedish)
                        “Skiner pa barnet i stallets stra
                        och de vakande fromma tva.”.
                            (in French)
                        “Le brillant coeur des anges aux 
                        bergers apparaît...”

           Maria eats her last bite of dinner and sighs, satisfied. 

           Among the people attending the banquet is FERDINAND (17), the 
           teenage son of a German family.  The boy wears an orthopaedic 
           prosthesis on his right arm.  He has a claw where his hand 
           should be.

           Maria notices Simon staring at Ferdinand.

                                 MARIA
                        Simon, stop staring.  Would you 
                        like being stared at if the same 
                        thing happened to you?

           Simon lowers his eyes, ashamed.  Ferdinand’s father looks at 
           Maria and smiles.  Maria smiles shyly back at him.

                                 SIMON
                            (playing it off)
                        No... I was looking at that Coca-
                        Cola. 

           Maria looks at Simon.  She isn’t fooled.  The boy blushes.

           The band starts playing a tacky version of Coldplay’s “In my 
           Place.”  THE THAI SINGER is wearing a Santa Claus hat and 
           looks deeply affected as he sings in an unintelligible 
           accent.  The result is pretty absurd.

           The buffet is a festival of colors and flavors.  Henry is 
           waiting in line when a YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL ENGLISH GIRL cuts in 
           line, smiling like a flirt.
                                 ENGLISH GIRL
                            (blatantly)
                        Excuse me.

                                 HENRY
                            (timidly)
                        Go ahead.

           The girl heads back to her table.  Henry watches her walk 
           off.  Suddenly his cell phone rings.

           Maria is sitting at the table, gazing off towards the party.  
           The boys can hardly sit still. 

                                 SIMON
                        Can we ride an elephant tomorrow?

                                 LUCAS
                        No, that’s on Monday.  Tomorrow we 
                        have nothing planned.

                                 THOMAS
                        Whatever you guys say, but I want 
                        to see the stars tonight.

           Maria looks around. There’s a group of VERY EXCITED GIRLS.  
           They arouse the interest of a group of SURFER DUDES.

           She looks at them for a moment, almost nostalgically.  At 
           another table, an ELDERLY MARRIED COUPLE finishes their meal 
           without speaking a word to each other.  Henry sits down at 
           the table with his plate almost empty and a hint of concern 
           on his face.  Maria notices.

                                 MARIA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 HENRY
                        I just got a message.  They gave 
                        Yunioshi a two-year contract 
                        extension. 

           Maria tries to think of something to say.

                                 MARIA
                        Don’t worry... You have plenty of 
                        practice getting bossed around all 
                        the time.  It’s not that bad.

           Henry tries to look like he isn’t upset about it.

           Candlelit paper lanterns appear in the sky behind the 
           rooftops of the bungalows.  Thomas spots them first. 
                                 THOMAS
                        Look!

                                 SIMON
                        Dad, what are those?

                                 HENRY
                        Sky lanterns!  You light them and 
                        make a wish.  You want to try it?

                                 LUCAS, THOMAS, AND SIMON
                        YEAH!!

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           Dozens of people light lanterns that rise into the sky.  
           Lucas, Thomas and Simon each light their own, aided by a 
           female Thai hotel employee.  Maria and Henry do the same.  
           They place them on the sand and wait for the heat to fill the 
           balloon with hot air. 

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        Now is ready.

           Lucas smiles.  His lantern rises a few inches and flies off 
           into the sky.

                                 SIMON
                        Wow!

           They each manage to get their lanterns airborne.  Henry and 
           Maria look at each other and smile. 

           The sky is filled with tiny lanterns that look like stars.  
           It’s quite a sight.  Maria watches them rise to the sky, 
           thinking to herself. 

           INT. BUNGALOW - DAWN

           Maria is jolted awake, startled for no apparent reason.  
           Henry and Thomas are sleeping side by side.  She checks the 
           alarm clock on the night table.  8:52 A.M.  She looks out the 
           window.  The sun shines brightly over the quiet sea. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM, BUNGALOW - DAY

           Maria quietly opens the door and looks inside.  Lucas and 
           Simon are fast asleep in their beds. 
           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Maria takes an aspirin out of her toiletry case and takes it 
           with a glass of water.

           EXT. SWIMMING POOL AREA - DAY

           Maria appears behind the pool bar with the book we’ve seen 
           before under her arm carrying two watermelon shakes.

           Lucas, Thomas and Simon are playing with a ball in the 
           children’s swimming pool.  Everyday bickering.  

           Maria crosses the swimming pool area on the opposite end, 
           where we find Henry sunbathing in a lounge chair.  He takes 
           out his Blackberry and puts it on the table beside him.

           Maria isn’t happy about the gesture.

                                 MARIA
                        You can’t even enjoy your vacation. 

           Henry doesn’t answer.  He thinks a moment.  We hear a child 
           crying nearby. 

                                 HENRY
                        I couldn’t stop thinking about 
                        Yunioshi last night.  Now there’s 
                        two of us doing the same job.  That 
                        can only mean one thing...

           Maria looks at him, trying to read his mind. 

                                 MARIA
                        Firing you would be way too 
                        expensive.  Don’t worry about it.

           A blender makes a lot of noise as a waitress prepares a shake 
           at the bar.

                                 HENRY
                        I can’t help it.  We can’t afford 
                        to lose this job. 

           Maria sets her book aside.  She sits down next to Henry.  She 
           looks over at the boys arguing in the pool. 

                                 MARIA
                            (very delicately)
                        Maybe we should consider moving 
                        back to England.  I could go back 
                        to working at the hospital.
           Maria tries to lighten things up with a smile. 

           The child is crying louder and louder.  It’s annoying.

                                 HENRY
                        Okay, we’ll think it over.  I’m 
                        going to play with the boys. 

           Henry gives Maria a kiss on the cheek and gets up. 

           Suddenly the blender stops.  So does the music playing in the 
           background over the loudspeaker.

           Henry walks over to the pool.  He looks pretty silly in a 
           bathing suit with an awful pattern.  Lucas turns. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Oh my God, pretend we don’t know 
                        each other.

                                 THOMAS
                        That’s the worst bathing suit of 
                        all time, Dad.  Really.

                                 SIMON
                        It’s awful.  Awful!

           Henry jumps in the pool, splashing Lucas on purpose.

           On the other side of the terrace, Maria opens her book.  
           Practically all the pages of the book are loose. 

           A gust of wind blows away a page of her book.

           Across the terrace, Henry hits the ball too hard, knocking it 
           out of the pool.

                                 HENRY
                        Lucas, would you mind...?

           Lucas, moping a bit, hops out of the pool and runs after it. 

           Maria runs after the page that blew away, which sticks to 
           drops of moisture on a glass shower screen by the pool.

                                 MARIA
                        Shit...

           On the other side of the adult pool, in front of Maria, Lucas 
           stops the ball with his foot.  He stops cold, stunned by a 
           loud noise, a strange roar that seems to be coming from the 
           very center of the Earth.  
           Maria reaches to peel the page off the glass and notices the 
           glass is vibrating.  Her reflection trembles in the glass.

           All the people around the pool turn to see where the sound is 
           coming from.

           Maria turns to the pool where Henry is looking around, 
           disoriented. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                            (tries to scream but 
                             nothing comes out)
                        Henry...

           Maria looks up in the direction of the coastline.  Tourists 
           point at the sea from the hotel balconies.  Birds fly 
           nervously back and forth in the sky.

           A woman appears from behind one of the bungalows, running 
           with a towel in her hand. 

           The line of palm trees farthest away is shaken violently in 
           perfect synchrony.

           A huge splash of foam rises behind the bungalows.

           Suddenly an enormous tongue of water rises behind the foam, 
           so thick light can’t get through it.  It crashes against the 
           bungalows like a claw grabbing a prey caught off guard. 

           A WALL OF BLACK WATER.

           A giant wave brought to a boil, raging straight from hell, 
           heading right for the hotel swimming pool at unreal speed, 
           destroying everything in its path. 

           Maria can’t believe her eyes.  She’s paralyzed by fear and 
           only has time to turn to Henry.

                                 HENRY
                            (this time the scream 
                             comes out)
                        Henry!  The boys!

           The crash is so loud that Maria doesn’t even know if he heard 
           her.  Henry takes one last look at Lucas.

           He realizes he’s too far away.  He grabs Thomas in one arm 
           and Simon in the other and starts running.

           Lucas looks at his mother and father, then dives into the 
           adult pool seconds before the black wall engulfs him. 
           The water reaches Henry with Simon and Thomas under each arm 
           and sweeps them away with brutal force in the direction of 
           the breakfast buffet. 

           Henry crashes into a column.  The crushing impact causes him 
           to lose his hold on Thomas and Simon and they slip out of his 
           arms. 

           Maria clings to her book.  She is struck violently by the 
           wave, which slams her against the glass shower screen, 
           smashing it into a thousand pieces.

           The dark water covers the camera and everything goes black.

           BLACK.

           EXT. FIRST WAVE - SURFACE

           Maria emerges.  She gasps desperately for hot air.  The sun 
           blinds her.  She’s dragged by the current through a thick 
           mass of swirling grayish-brown mud, an endless expanse of 
           black death.  All she can hear is a buzz and the sound of her 
           own heart racing.

           Maria can’t help but swallow more water.  She’s about to 
           crash into the top of a palm tree sticking out of the water.  
           She opens her arms, crashes into the tree and grabs the trunk 
           as tightly as she can.  The current pulls her but she manages 
           to hold on.  That’s when she manages to get a look at what’s 
           happening. 

           The water has completely covered the hotel, of which only the 
           top floor and roof are visible. 

           A large dresser appears in the water, its legs pointed at her 
           in a threatening way.  The object crashes into the palm tree 
           and broken glass is lodged in her chest. 

           Maria tries to understand what’s going on.  Her face reveals 
           shock, desperation, anguish.

           She’s sucked underwater by another wave for a few moments 
           that feel like an eternity. 

           Then, as she reaches the surface, she spots something.

           IT’S LUCAS.

           Lucas turns towards his mother almost intuitively.  They make 
           eye contact for a brief moment.
                                 MARIA
                            (as loud as she can)
                        LUCAS!

           Maria immediately lets go of the palm tree. 

           Maria swims as fast as she can, fighting the current.  
           Another wave engulfs Maria. 

           She surfaces.  She can’t see Lucas.  She looks around and 
           spots him swimming about 30 feet ahead. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Lucas, swim towards me!

           Maria slowly gets closer to him.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Careful, Lucas!

           Lucas swims with all his might to reach her. 

           Maria spots a mattress floating a few meters away. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Lucas!  Grab the mattress!

           Lucas and Maria swim desperately towards the mattress and 
           manage to grab hold of the edge a moment.  They reach out 
           their hands, struggling to grab hold of each other.  Their 
           fingers touch for a moment, but an even strong current turns 
           over the mattress and they lose their grip.

                                 LUCAS
                        They’re all dead, Mom.  We’re gonna
                        die.

                                 MARIA
                            (sharply)
                        No, Lucas.  We are not going to 
                        die.  You watch the front and I’ll 
                        watch the back, okay?  We’ll look 
                        out for each other.

           Lucas nods.

           A car carried by the current floats between them.  In the 
           back seat we see a small child still tied to his car seat.  
           He isn’t moving and he’s covered in mud.  They stare at him 
           in silence as the car floats past.

           The current seems to be weakening.
           The floating car slowly floats off, then stops and begins to 
           slowly sink.

           But the undertow picks up and turns the vehicle around.  A 
           huge wave of debris appears behind the vehicle and heads 
           straight for Maria and Lucas.

           The car comes in too fast for them to react and it hits Lucas 
           in the back of the head.  He goes limp, floating at the mercy 
           of the current.  The sound slowly fades.

           Suddenly Lucas resurfaces.  He comes to and looks around for 
           his mother. 

           He panics.

                                 LUCAS
                        MOM!!!

           Lucas looks around but can’t find her. 

           Suddenly Maria resurfaces.  Her inert body floats on the 
           surface, then crashes into debris and gets hooked. 

           Maria doesn’t move.  Lucas watches, looking for some signed 
           of life. 

           Then Maria moves.

           Lucas swims after her.  The current pulls him under.

           Maria unhooks herself and swims towards her son.

           Lucas lunges for her and throws his arms around her.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                            (very angry, shouting)
                        Never do that to me again, Mom! 
                        Never do that to me again!

           Maria is too exhausted to say anything else. She simply 
           squeezes the boy in her arms.  Nothing in the world could 
           separate them.

           The current carries them towards an uprooted palm tree 
           trapped between the trunks of two trees.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        How about that tree over there, 
                        Mom?

                                 MARIA
                        It’s perfect, Lucas.  That trunk is 
                        perfect.  Perfect.
           They approach the uprooted palm tree and manage to grab hold.  
           Maria notices the undertow trying to pull them out to sea.

           Lucas tries to climb onto the tree, balancing the trunk in 
           such a way that he might slip off.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Lucas, don’t move!  We have to 
                        blend in with the tree like leaves.  
                        That way we might be able to trick 
                        the sea.

           Lucas stops trying to climb up the tree.  Two of them hold 
           onto the trunk and let their bodies float freely without 
           resisting the current. 

           The water slowly returns to the sea, the situation has 
           apparently calmed down.

                                 LUCAS
                        Is it over?

                                 MARIA
                        No, Lucas.  The worse is yet to 
                        come. 

           Lucas looks out to sea and at the surrounding area.  He looks 
           at his mother. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Then they’re all dead.  They must 
                        be. 

                                 MARIA
                            (sharply)
                        Now isn’t the time, Lucas.  You 
                        have to be strong.  We have to be 
                        strong for each other. 

           Lucas can’t believe what’s happening and he suddenly feels 
           ashamed.  Maria holds him in her arms.

                                 LUCAS
                        I thought I was a brave kid.

           Maria embraces the boy.

                                 MARIA
                        You’re doing great.

           Maria strokes his hair and kisses his forehead.  She checks 
           herself discreetly so Lucas won’t notice.  She’s covered with 
           cuts. 
           Lucas inspects the debris being carried out to sea by the 
           current.  Cars, remains, even a destroyed bungalow floating 
           out to sea.

           The camera rises above them, further and further away.  From 
           the sky, Maria and Lucas are an insignificant dot in the 
           middle of the catastrophe.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. UPROOTED TREE TRUNK - DAY

           We see the tops of two trees.  We slowly go down their trunks 
           and see the mark the water level has left on them.  We 
           continue our descent and find an uprooted palm tree stuck 
           between two trees.  We pan along the trunk until we reach the 
           interwoven hands of Maria and Lucas, holding on to each 
           other, and finally, their faces.  They’re exhausted, but very 
           alert.

           Suddenly Lucas realizes something.

                                 LUCAS
                        Mom, I think I can touch the 
                        bottom.

           Maria looks at him.  She carefully slides off the tree and 
           lets go enough to feel for the bottom.  She grimaces with 
           pain and tries to hide it. 

                                 MARIA
                        Yeah.
                            (pause)
                        We should look for somewhere safer.  
                        Are you ready?

           Lucas nods and lets go of the tree.  Maria lets go of the 
           tree and they walk hand in hand. 

           The palm tree, freed of the weight, sinks into the water.  
           The crest comes unhooked from the two trees.  Maria and Lucas 
           watch the palm tree drift to the sea.

                                 LUCAS
                        Will there be another wave?

                                 MARIA
                        We should find somewhere safe just 
                        in case.

           Maria turns and looks forward.  She spots a reedbed with a 
           wooded area not too far away.
                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        We should head inland. 

           Lucas checks it out, thinking.  He nods.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

           EXT. FLOODED FOREST - DAY

           Maria and Lucas walk through a forest with water above their 
           waists.  Debris of all sorts float around them, but the water 
           isn’t moving. 

           EXT. REEDBED - DAY

           Lucas walks behind Maria through a reedbed.  The strength of 
           the water has twisted all the stalks.  It’s difficult to get 
           through.  Behind them we see the electronic cables of a 
           lamppost hanging dangerously close to the water.

                                 LUCAS
                        Mom, what will we do now?

                                 MARIA (O.S.)
                        Keep walking. 

           Lucas notices the cuts on his mother’s back.  One of them, 
           chest high in her ribcage, looks very serious and is bleeding 
           profusely.  The the broken reeds along the way block his 
           view. 

                                 LUCAS
                        How will we get by?

           Maria continues walking without answering.

           Lucas pushes away the broken reeds, trying to get closer to 
           his mother, but every time he pushes one away, several others 
           take its place, blocking his path.

           Lucas steps on something hard and sharp.  He grimaces in 
           pain. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        I think I hurt myself.

           Something is floating in the water on his left, caught in the 
           stalks.  Lucas doesn’t stop.  It’s a dead baby elephant.

           Lucas keeps walking. 
                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Where are we gonna live?  Will we 
                        have to move back to England and 
                        live with Grandpa and Grandma?

                                 MARIA
                            (very sweetly)
                        I don’t know, Lucas. Don’t stop.

           A roar from the sea awakens Lucas from his trance. 

           Lucas turns and looks out to sea.  The reeds rock back and 
           forth softly. 

                                 LUCAS
                            (whispering)
                        Mom.

           Lucas turns to his mother, who is looking out to sea, her 
           face filled with anguish. 

           And for the first time he sees his mother, naked from the 
           waist up, with her thorax torn apart.

           One of her breasts has been almost ripped completely off.  
           Her entire body is covered with cuts that bleed and bleed.  
           Lucas takes it all in.  He’s speechless.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Mom, I can’t see you like this.

           Maria looks at her chest.  She rips a piece off her shorts 
           and tries to cover her breast with it.  Lucas is touched by 
           the gesture.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           Maria turns and keeps walking.  The water level reaches just 
           below her thigh.  Lucas notices a large chunk of Maria’s 
           thigh hanging off her leg.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Mom...

           Maria stops.  She sees Lucas looking at her leg and she looks 
           down.  She holds the loose flesh hanging off her leg with her 
           hand. 

                                 MARIA
                            (very weak)
                        You lead the way. 
           Lucas obeys.  He holds his hand out to Maria and takes the 
           lead. 

           He sniffles and quickly wipes dirt off his face, trying to 
           hide his tears. 

                                 LUCAS
                        We need to find you a doctor.

                                 MARIA
                            (in a faint voice)
                        As soon as we find somewhere safe 
                        to stop.  Keep going. 

           Lucas continues walking in silence. 

           Lucas pushes aside the stalks in front of him and sees a huge 
           clearing that is partially flooded with a large tree and the 
           jungle behind.

           EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

           Lucas and Maria wade quietly through water up to their 
           ankles.  Maria’s pace would indicate she’s trying to save her 
           strength.

           Lucas scans the horizon.  The sea continues to roar.

                                 LUCAS
                        The tree over there.  Do you think 
                        we can climb it?

           Lucas points at the tree.  The roots are exposed above the 
           mud.  The trunk is twisted and tilted and several other 
           stalks around it simplify the climb to higher branches.

                                 MARIA
                        It’s perfect.  You’re the best tree 
                        finder I know.  Let’s go. 

                                 LUCAS
                            (very serious)
                        Thanks.

           Lucas and Maria start walking when a squeal coming from the 
           jungle breaks the silence. 

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hjälp.

           Lucas keeps walking.  Maria stops.  She lets god of his hand. 
                                 MARIA
                        Did you hear that?

                                 LUCAS
                        No...

           Maria signals for him to be quiet.  The two remain completely 
           silent.  Waiting. 

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hjälp!  Hjälp!

           Lucas turns to his mother, pleading.

                                 LUCAS
                        There’s nothing we can do, Mom.

           Maria tries to figure out where the cries are coming from.  
           Lucas looks desperately out to sea.  The roar continues.  He 
           looks at the tree, which offers safety.

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hjälp!  Snällaaaaa!

           Maria walks over to Lucas.  He shakes his head and points at 
           the tree.  They’re within 30 feet.

                                 LUCAS
                        We’re almost there.  We have to get 
                        to safety.

                                 MARIA
                        Lucas, we have to help that boy.

                                 LUCAS
                        If another wave catches us down 
                        here we’ll die.  We have to climb 
                        that tree right now.

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hjälp!

           Maria keeps looking around. 

                                 MARIA
                            (shouting)
                        Where are you?

                                 CHILD’S VOICE
                            (desperate)
                        HÄÄALP!!! 

           Maria picks out a spot, locating the source of the sound.  
           Lucas grows desperate.
                                 LUCAS
                        Look at you!  We need help too.  
                        Mom, we can’t risk it...

                                 MARIA
                        What if that boy were Simon?  Or 
                        Thomas?  What if they needed help 
                        somewhere?  Wouldn’t you want 
                        someone to help them?

                                 LUCAS
                        Simon and Thomas are dead.

           Lucas remains silent a moment, lowering his eyes. 

           Maria looks at the tree.  Safety is only a few yards away. 

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hjälp! Hjälp!

           Maria takes Lucas by the chin and forces him to look at her.

                                 MARIA
                        We have to help that boy, even if 
                        it’s the last thing we do.

           Lucas nods.  Takes a breath.

           EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

           Maria and Lucas walk through an area with more trees.  The 
           cries are getting closer and closer.

                                 LUCAS
                        I think I see him.

           Lucas starts running towards a small clearing, splashing 
           through puddles that reach his knees or waist at most.

           Tangled in the vines of a tree, five feet off the ground, we 
           see a five-year-old NAKED BOY.  He looks weak and scared and 
           his skin is extremely pale.  He’s in shock and he can’t 
           manage to free himself.  Lucas walks over to him.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        It’s all right, we’ll help you. 
                        What’s your name?

                                 NAKED BOY
                        Daniel.
                                 LUCAS
                        Daniel, I’m Lucas.  From England.  
                        Where are you from?

                                 DANIEL
                        Hjälp!

                                 LUCAS
                        Are you hurt somewhere?

                                 DANIEL
                        Hjälp...

           The boy reaches out to Lucas.  Lucas does his best to 
           untangle him.

                                 LUCAS
                        Come on, help me out here...

           The boy kicks the vines and falls to the ground.

           Maria walks over to him and tries to bend over, but a sharp 
           pain stops her cold.  She grows dizzy and has to lean on the 
           tree to stay conscious.

                                 MARIA
                            (very weak)
                        You help him.

           Lucas takes the boy in his arms.  The boy is scared by the 
           sight of Maria.

                                 LUCAS
                        Let’s get back to the tree.  Hurry.

           Lucas raises Daniel on his shoulders and starts walking 
           inland.

           EXT. TREE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY

           The three of them reach the tree Lucas and Maria saw earlier.  
           Maria inspects the top of the tree.  There’s a thick branch 
           that looks safe about 15 feet up.  The trunk is tilted 
           slightly, but in her condition it won’t be an easy climb.  
           She points at some palm fronds on the ground.

                                 MARIA
                        Rip some leaves off that branch. 

                                 LUCAS
                        What for?
                                 MARIA
                            (exhausted)
                        Please...

           Lucas obeys and quickly rips some leaves off the branch.  She 
           takes one of them and does the best she can to tie the loose 
           flesh from her thigh back into place with it.  Fresh blood 
           gushes out of the wound as she tightens the strips.  Lucas 
           looks away. 

           The roar of the sea grows louder.  Lucas looks towards the 
           coast.  Maria also looks up as she finishes tightening the 
           leaves around her thigh. 

           Daniel starts crying.  Lucas wants to say something, he looks 
           around, there’s no sign of civilization.  

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        We have no other choice, Lucas.  I 
                        can’t walk anymore.  Someone will 
                        find us. 

           Suddenly Lucas spots something floating in the puddle at the 
           foot of the tree.  It’s an unopened can of Coca-Cola.  Lucas 
           grabs it and holds it up.

                                 LUCAS
                        Can we?

           Maria smiles ever so slightly and nods.

                                 MARIA
                        I think today we can make an 
                        exception.

           Lucas puts the can in the lining of his bathing suit and 
           starts climbing the tree with Daniel on his back.  The boy 
           remains in a state of shock and doesn’t move.

                                 LUCAS
                        You can help me out, you know...

           Maria reaches the tree.  She leans her body over the trunk 
           and hugs it.  She notices her wedding ring on her finger, 
           covered in dirt and mud.  Maria looks at it sadly for a 
           moment. 

           Maria’s feet and hands push with all their might.  The rough 
           trunk of the tree presses against the open wounds covering 
           her body and she lets out a cry of pain.  Blood gushes from 
           her wounds  

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Can you do it, Mom?
                                 MARIA
                            (shouting)
                        Of course I can, what’s gonna stop 
                        me?  Keep going!

           Lucas obeys and continues climbing.  Maria grips the tree 
           with her nails and pushes with her good leg, dragging the bad 
           one over her thigh, trying not to allow contact with the 
           wounded side. 

           Her “bandage” which she had over her thorax falls.  She 
           instinctively covers her breast with her hand and slips.  She 
           almost falls but manages to grab the trunk. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Are you okay?

                                 MARIA
                            (whispering)
                        I slipped, that’s all.

           Maria rests a few moments, gathering her strength.  She looks 
           up at where Lucas and Daniel are resting on the branch.  She 
           looks down and sees her reflection in a small red puddle of 
           her own blood.

           Lucas sees that his mother has stopped moving and he turns to 
           Daniel.

                                 LUCAS
                        Stay here.  Don’t move.

           Lucas climbs down the trunk and stops next to his mother, 
           hugging the opposite side of the tree. 

                                 MARIA
                        What are you doing?

                                 LUCAS
                        I’ll put my arms and legs where you 
                        need to grab on, okay?  Use me for 
                        support.  I’m softer than the tree.  
                        That way you won’t hurt yourself so 
                        much.

           Maria smiles.  It’s a silly idea, but I can’t hurt. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Come on, your right foot on my left 
                        knee, can you find it?

           Maria moves her leg slowly until her foot slides over Lucas’ 
           knee.
                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Now push yourself up.

           Maria pushes.  The muscles of Lucas’ body tense up, clinging 
           to the tree.  Maria slides up about a foot.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Now wait. 

           Lucas carefully slides his leg from under his mother and 
           repositions himself a little higher up the tree.  He makes 
           sure his grip is tight and smiles, encouraging her. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Your right hand on my right hand.  
                        Hold onto the tree from behind. 

           Maria obeys. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Now your left foot on my right 
                        knee.  And push.

           Maria pushes and climbs another foot.  The two hold each 
           other a moment around the tree with the trunk in between.  
           Maria looks at her son, nodding, gaining confidence.  

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        You’re almost there.  Come on, 
                        another step.

           Lucas repositions himself over and over again.  It’s a 
           painful process for Maria but it’s a beautiful sight, a 
           genuine display of love.  Finally they look at each other, 
           their faces almost touching.

                                 MARIA
                        Thank you, Lucas.

           EXT. TREETOP - DAY

           Maria kneels, putting pressure on her thigh to stop the 
           bleeding.  A sudden jolt of pain rushes through her body.  
           Lucas appears behind her and sits on a branch near where 
           Daniel is waiting. 

           Then, about 150 feet away, Maria spots a YOUNG NATIVE sitting 
           on top of a tree, watching the sea from a distance.  He looks 
           at Maria.  There is something primitive and pure about the 
           young man that awakens powerful emotions in Maria. 

           The crack of the can opening snaps Maria out of her trance.  
           Lucas offers Maria a sip of Coca-Cola.  
           She takes a swig and passes it back.  Lucas takes a quick sip 
           and passes it to Daniel.  Daniel passes it to Maria.  She 
           takes a swig to gain strength and passes the can back to 
           Lucas. 

           The boy settles into the branch across from his mother, 
           vigilant.  She shifts her weight, trying to find the least 
           painful position on the branch.

           An unreal silence fills the air. 

           Maria rests her head on the trunk of the tree and closes her 
           eyes. 

                                                               BLACK.

           EXT. TREETOP, LATER - DAY

           Lucas wakes up his mother shouting.  We hear the sound of a 
           single-engine plane flying over the area.

                                 LUCAS
                        Hey!  Shit, why don’t they turn 
                        around?  There’s no way they didn’t 
                        see us. 

                                 MARIA
                        They must be doing Recon.  They 
                        have to evaluate the situation 
                        before they start rescuing people. 

           Maria looks at the tree where the old man had climbed up.  
           There’s no one there.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Where did he go?

                                 LUCAS
                        Who?

           Maria doesn’t answer and closes her eyes.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Lucas, what color is the gash in my 
                        leg?

           Lucas inspects Maria’s thigh.  It’s swollen and bruised.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Red.
                                 MARIA
                        I might... if I get a fever... if 
                        it gets infected, I might have 
                        convulsions... but they’ll pass.  
                        Don’t let it scare you. 

           Lucas gathers himself and takes out the can of Coca-Cola.  He 
           gives his mother a sip. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s warm...

           Lucas shakes the can to see how much is left.

                                 LUCAS
                        Drink a little more.

           Maria shakes her head and turns to lean on the tree.  She 
           gives the can back to Lucas.

           That’s when she notices Lucas pretending to drink.  He’s 
           conscious of the seriousness of his mother’s injuries and is 
           saving the Coca-Cola for her. 

                                 MARIA
                        Drink it, Lucas.  You need to drink 
                        something too.

                                                               BLACK.

           EXT. TREE - DAY

           Maria opens her eyes.  She’s covered with sweat, but right 
           next to her we see Lucas isn’t sweating at all.

                                 MARIA
                        What day is today?

                                 LUCAS
                        December 26th.

                                 MARIA
                        No, I mean day of the week.  Is it 
                        Saturday or Sunday?

           Lucas doesn’t understand the question.  He looks worried.

                                 LUCAS
                        Sunday.

           Maria looks exhausted.  Saddened.
                                 MARIA
                        Simon and Thomas were both born on 
                        a Sunday.

           A long silence.  Lucas tries to think of something to say.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        You were born on a Thursday, you 
                        know.  When you were born you 
                        weren’t breathing, you didn’t move 
                        at all. 

           Lucas looks at his mother.  She seems out of it, almost 
           delirious. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I thought... He’s dead.  My baby 
                        was born dead.  And if he’s dead, I 
                        don’t want to live either.

           Maria smiles at her son tenderly.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        And then the doctor gave you a loud 
                        slap on the rear-end... and you 
                        started crying and screaming.  And 
                        I thought it was the most beautiful 
                        sound I’d ever heard. ...

           Lucas looks at his mother with concern.  Maria smiles at 
           Lucas a moment and closes her eyes again. 

           EXT. TREETOP, MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Maria is awakened by TERRIFYING SCREAMS.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Help!  Help!  I’m dying!

           Maria and Lucas turn and look in the direction of the screams 
           but no one’s there.  They’re coming from somewhere in the 
           thick of the jungle.  Daniel also wakes up.  

           Lucas looks at Maria, unsure what to do.  She has clearly 
           reached her limit.  The branch under her leg is completely 
           covered with blood.

           Lucas leans over his mother as if he didn’t want Daniel to 
           hear him.

                                 LUCAS
                        Promise me you’re not gonna die.
           Maria smiles tenderly.

                                 MARIA
                        Sweetheart, I promise I’ll do 
                        everything I can, but I can’t 
                        guarantee I’ll be strong enough.

           Dark thoughts invade her mind.  She struggles to contain 
           them.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Lucas, if what we don’t want to 
                        happen happens...

           Maria searches for strength.  Maria doesn’t want to hear 
           this.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        ...I want you to wait until the 
                        water level drops and take Daniel 
                        in that direction.

           Maria points left, in the direction of the sun. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        The road must be that way, not very 
                        far.

           Lucas is about to cry.

                                 LUCAS
                        Please, Mom...

           Maria is about to speak but remains silent.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Please!  I’m dying!  Can’t anybody 
                        hear me?

           Lucas covers his ears.

                                 MARIA
                            (whispering)
                        Shut the fuck up.

           Maria lies back on the branch to regain her strength.  Lucas 
           offers her more Coca-Cola.  He pours the last few drops on 
           his mother’s lips as she closes her eyes. 

           Lucas squeezes the can and lets it drop from the tree.  We 
           follow it all the way to the ground.
           The water has almost completely returned to the sea.  The can 
           floats in a puddle made red by Maria’s blood.

                                                               BLACK.

           EXT. TREETOP, LATER - DAY

           Everything is silent.  Lucas’ eyes are red from having cried.  
           He looks at Maria.  She isn’t moving and her eyes are closed. 

           Lucas moves closer to her to see if she’s breathing.  Her 
           chest rises and drops slowly.  Maria opens her eyes. 

                                 MARIA
                        Do you hear that?

           We hear footsteps in the jungle. 

           Lucas looks down.  In the vegetation two Thai men appear: a 
           strong, handsome, YOUNG MAN, the same man she saw earlier in 
           the tree, and a smaller, cranky-looking OLD MAN.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Lucas, get down.

                                 LUCAS
                        But Mom...

                                 MARIA
                            (sternly)
                        Do it.

           Lucas obeys and climbs down the tree as the young man reaches 
           up to help Daniel. 

           Maria smiles, relieved someone will help Lucas, but the young 
           man hoists Daniel onto his shoulders and walks away.  The old 
           man shouts at Maria to climb down. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                            (in a weak voice)
                        I’m coming.

           Maria tries to slide down the trunk but slips and falls into 
           the water.

           When he sees this the old man notices her injuries and his 
           expression slightly changes. 

           She tries to get up.  The old man offers her his hand and 
           takes her around the waist.  Maria tries a couple of steps 
           but the pain is too intense.  She collapses to the ground. 
           The old man shouts something at her in Thai but she doesn’t 
           understand.

           The old man drags Maria on the ground, but the scraping hurts 
           her too much.  She cries out in pain.

           She lies on the ground in a puddle of water and points at a 
           dry area, shaking her finger as if to say “Not that way.”

           EXT. MUDDY PATH - DAY

           The elderly man pulls Maria by the arms, looking for puddles 
           of water that will do her the least harm.  But there are 
           times when it’s simply impossible and he has no choice but to 
           pull her across rough areas covered with stones and debris.

           The old man shouts at her in Thai but she doesn’t understand.

           Maria winces in pain, but doesn’t complain. 

                                 MARIA
                            (barely audible)
                        Thank you...

           We can tell the man is very nervous.  He shouts at her in 
           Thai to encourage her and constantly looks at the sea.

           Maria tries to push herself along with her good leg.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           The man’s shouting fades and all she can hear is her own 
           breathing. 

           Drops of black sweat stream down Maria’s forehead. 

           She looks at the sky.  The sun blinds her.

           We see the tops of trees pass before her eyes, alternating 
           with moments of blinding sunshine. 

           A group of shapes enter the frame.  Several men and women 
           pick her up.  Maria sighs, relieved.  She looks at her right 
           hand.  

           There’s Lucas, holding her hand and smiling.
           EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

           Maria is lying on the ground with Lucas beside her.  A group 
           of LOCALS contemplate her with a mixture of concern and 
           curiosity.  Maria feels embarrassed.

           A small village of three or four huts.  A CORPULENT THAI 
           WOMAN appears followed by some children.  We can hear a 
           children’s program on television inside the hut. 

           The woman walks through the group surrounding Maria and 
           carefully wipes her face clean with a cloth.

           Another woman appears holding a yellow button down shirt.  
           She incorporates Maria and the other women help dress her.

           Maria is brought to tears.

                                 MARIA
                        Thank you... so much.

           We hear a banging sound coming from one of the nearby huts.  
           Lucas turns to see what’s going on.

           Through chicken wire around the yard of a small house built 
           out of metal panels and bricks we see men using a hammer to 
           take a door off its hinges.  One of them gestures for Lucas 
           to come inside. 

           INT. HUT - DAY

           Lucas enters the humble dwelling, dark except for light 
           sneaking through cracks in the metal roof panels.  He walks 
           through the corridor and reaches the living room. 

           On the wall we see several portraits and a couple of 
           improvised altars covered with flowers, candles and 
           offerings.  There’s a Thai boy watching television.

           The two men remove the door from the hinges and gesture for 
           Lucas to help them carry it. 

           EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

           Lucas, the Thai boy and the two men emerge from the hut 
           carrying a wooden door.

           The men lift Maria and place her on the door, using it like a 
           stretcher.  They drag the door with Maria over to a pick-up 
           truck. 
           Lucas gets in the back of the pick-up.  One of the men taps 
           the side of the pick-up and it drives off.  But the old man 
           shouts at them and the pick-up stops.  He hops in back.

           The pick-up drives off.

                                 MARIA
                            (to Lucas)
                        Lucas, where is Daniel?

           Lucas looks back but doesn’t see the boy anywhere.

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t know.

           EXT. PICK-UP, ROAD - DAY

           The pick-up drives along rugged terrain. 

           Lucas sticks his head out of the pick-up.  On the side of the 
           road we see a tourist covered in blood helping other people 
           on the ground.

           Across the road we see a pick-up parked with two women lying 
           in back.  We don’t have time to tell if they’re alive or not.  
           People are standing around them, looking at them.

           The pick-up passes two people with minor injuries walking in 
           the same direction.  Lucas watches them, spellbound, when 
           suddenly he’s startled by a slapping sound.

           He turns and finds the old Thai man sitting over Maria, 
           slapping her in the face.  Lucas looks at him angrily.

                                 LUCAS
                        Don’t hurt her!

           The pick-up drives over a bump, causing Maria great pain.  
           The old man realizes and sits behind her, incorporating her 
           and sitting under her to soften the blow of each bump.

           Maria leans her head on the old man’s shoulder.  She can see 
           Lucas sitting beside her and two curious Thai children 
           sticking their heads out of the back window.  The old man 
           holds up hear head, forcing her to look at her son, making 
           gestures and shouting something in Thai.

           Maria closes her eyes, but the old man slaps her awake again.

                                 MARIA
                        Just five minutes.  I’m really 
                        tired...
           Maria closes her eyes again.  The old man is furious.  He 
           slaps her again, shouting at her and pointing at Lucas.

                                 OLD MAN
                            (in Thai)
                        See?  Your son!  Right there!

                                 LUCAS
                        Hang in there, Mom.  We’re almost 
                        there.

           Maria looks at the sky, exhausted.

           The trees begin to grow more abundant.

           We start seeing electric wires.

           Streetlamps.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           We start hearing more voices.  Weeping.  People crying out 
           desperately for help.  More vehicles.  Maria looks around, 
           trying to find Lucas.  A shadow suddenly covers her.  

           The pick-up stops.

                                 MARIA
                        Lucas, what’s happening?

           Lucas sits up and looks outside.

           The pick-up has stopped at the end of a ramp leading to the 
           entrance of a hospital where a lot of other cars are waiting.

           Injured people, medical personnel and tourists crowd before 
           the entrance.  The old man gets up and tells some other men 
           to help him.

           The men carry Maria inside, still lying on the door, going 
           around vehicles and crowds of people trying to get in.  Lucas 
           runs behind , trying to help them, but he’s too short to 
           offer much help.

           Suddenly he slips and falls.  The floor is covered with blood 
           and mud.  He looks around.  Several nurses attend to people 
           with lighter injuries lying on the floor while those with 
           more serious injuries try to get inside.

           A NURSE stops the procession.  He quickly checks Maria and 
           then gestures that they can’t taker her.  But the old man 
           pays no attention to him and gets the men to proceed down the 
           corridor with Maria.  Lucas tries to keep up.
           INT. MAIN ENTRANCE, HOSPITAL - DAY

           The procession enters the reception area of the hospital, 
           crammed with injured people and family members, people 
           rushing in and out, calling out for their loved ones through 
           the chaos.  We see more injured people stretched out across 
           cardboard boxes on the floor in the corridors.

           The group advances with Maria to a large reception desk in 
           the middle of the hall.  A THAI RECEPTIONIST with way too 
           much to do shouts at them, but the old man doesn’t stop.  He 
           signals for Lucas to speak to her.

                                 LUCAS
                        My mom is badly hurt.  We need to 
                        see a doctor.

           The receptionist hands Lucas paper and a pencil and points at 
           a panel on the wall, speaking a mix of Thai and English.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                            (mixed with other words we 
                             don’t understand)
                        Names! List!

           The panel on the wall is covered with pieces of paper fixed 
           to a bulletin board.  On each paper we see names and a 
           country of origin.  Lucas takes a closer look.

           England, Norway, Germany, Italy... People from all over. 

           Lucas writes quickly:

           Maria Bennett, Lucas Bennett - JAPAN / ENGLAND.

           He pins the paper to the bulletin board and runs out.  He 
           passes a NAKED MAN wandering aimlessly down the corridor. 

                                 NAKED MAN
                        It’s all gone.  Everything’s gone.

           Lucas looks around for his mother but can’t find her.  He 
           runs into the old man, who points at a room between Radiology 
           and the elevator.  

                                 LUCAS
                        Thank you.  So much.  For 
                        everything.

           The old man smiles at him with no teeth and smacks him, 
           trying to be affectionate.  He says something in Thai which 
           Lucas can’t understand but sounds like “good luck.”
                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Okay!

           Lucas runs to the room the man indicated.

           INT. STOCKROOM, HOSPITAL - DAY

           The small room in which they’ve left Maria is where they 
           store medicine.  A FEMALE VOLUNTEER enters and leaves a box 
           of antibiotics covered with mud in the corner.  Maria’s door 
           is resting on an examination table.  Lucas walks to the 
           volunteer and points at his mother. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Please.  We need help.

           The volunteer looks at Maria, frightened.  She indicates that 
           she’ll be right back.

           A BALD MAN enters the room, tall and with blue eyes.  He 
           looks at Maria. 

                                 BALD MAN
                        Ar du svenska?

           Maria looks at him without understanding.

                                 MARIA
                        Sorry?

                                 BALD MAN
                        Are you Swedish?

           Lucas shakes his head.

                                 BALD MAN (CONT’D)
                            (to Maria)
                        Are you married to someone from 
                        Sweden?

                                 LUCAS
                        We’re English but we live in Japan.

                                 BALD MAN
                        Then I can’t help you, I’m sorry.

           The bald man leaves them the room.  Maria tries to smile at 
           Lucas to assure him but suddenly her body goes into violent 
           convulsions which are beyond her control.

                                 LUCAS
                        Mom, what’s wrong?  What do I do?
           Maria looks at the medicine cabinet.

                                 MARIA
                        Find antibiotics.  Check that 
                        cabinet.  Read me the labels. 

           Lucas rushes nervously over to the cabinet and opens it.  
           Right then a DOCTOR enters the room, accompanied by the 
           volunteer we saw before.  He has a beautiful face and a 
           relaxed and rested voice.  Maria wastes no time.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                            (to the doctor)
                        You see this kid here?  I’m the 
                        only thing he has left in this 
                        world.  Do you understand?

           The doctor nods.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I’m a doctor too.  I have septic 
                        shock.  You have to stop the 
                        bleeding and give me antibiotics 
                        right away.  Please.

           Lucas is taken aback by his mother’s frankness.  The doctor 
           opens the cabinet and prepares a syringe as he gives the 
           volunteer quick and concise instructions in Thai. 

           The doctor sticks the needle in Maria’s arm and notices the 
           shock in Lucas’ face.

                                 DOCTOR
                        We’ll get your mom to surgery.  
                        Don’t worry, she’ll be okay.

           Lucas turns to his mother.  The doctor finishes giving her 
           the shot and carefully opens Maria’s shirt.  Lucas turns 
           away. 

           We see the doctor’s face is worried as he examines Maria.  He 
           removes several leaves that were stuck to her wounds.  

           Lucas takes Maria by the hand.  She doesn’t look at him.  
           She’s too focused on trying to keep breathing.  

           The volunteer separates the flesh from her thigh and pours an 
           entire bottle of iodine on the wound.  The floor is a 
           quagmire of iodine, mud and blood.

           The volunteer proceeds to bandage the wound but runs out of 
           gauze.  She picks up a roll of toilet paper and uses it to 
           finish the job.
                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Does anyone know you’re here?

           Maria becomes very serious.  For the first time she has to 
           face the situation. 

                                 MARIA
                        I lost my husband and two kids.  If 
                        anything happens to me...

           The doctor indicates for the volunteer to close the door.  
           She obeys.  Then, with trembling hands, he takes a cell phone 
           out of his pocket and hands it to Maria.

           Maria takes the telephone.  She starts dialing.  On screen we 
           read: +44... She stops.  We see her trying to remember.

                                 LUCAS
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MARIA
                        Do you know Grandpa and Grandma’s 
                        number by heart?

           Lucas shakes his head helplessly.  We see Maria’s face 
           unravel with desperation.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                            (to the doctor)
                        I can’t believe it.  I’ve known 
                        this number all my life...

           The doctor smiles, trying to relax her as she hands the phone 
           back to him.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Don’t worry.  It’s the shock.  If 
                        it comes back to you, let me know.

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS - DAY

           TWO MEN rush Maria from the main hall through a series of 
           interior corridors that connect different identical wards.  
           General chaos everywhere.  People run through a labyrinth of 
           open hallways.  It’s hard to get a fix on where you are. 

           Lucas grips his mother’s hand tightly, she looks out of it.  
           A FOREIGN TOURIST stops and grabs Maria’s head, turning it to 
           get a better look at her. 

                                 TOURIST
                        Francesca?
           Maria looks up at him, half-groggy.  Lucas pushes him away.

                                 LUCAS
                        Be careful!

           They reach a side ward on the first floor. 

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           A large room with dozens of injured people lying in beds.  
           Maria’s door is placed on a bed frame by a large window.  The 
           window shakes as the bed is pushed against the wall.  Maria 
           looks at it, afraid.

                                 MARIA
                        No, not here.

                                 LUCAS
                        Why not?

                                 MARIA
                        Not by the window...

           TOTAL CHAOS.  People constantly rushing in and out amid 
           screaming, crying and tension.  We see the bald Swedish man 
           passing from bed to bed.  A NORWEGIAN WOMAN cries out to 
           anyone who can hear. 

                                 NORWEGIAN WOMAN
                        Please, I need to pee.

           Maria turns to one side where she finds a YOUNG WOMAN in her 
           early twenties resting on a bed with a mattress, staring off 
           into nowhere.

                                 MARIA
                        What is your name?

           The girl doesn’t answer or react.  Maria looks in another 
           direction.  The bed next to her is half covered by a curtain 
           resting on a trestle with wheels.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Maria waits for an answer from the woman behind the curtain.

           The bruised, black and blue arm of a middle-aged woman hangs 
           out, with several open wounds that have gone black.  A spider 
           crosses her face but she doesn’t react. 
           Maria turns towards another bed with a BRITISH TOURIST.  He 
           doesn’t look very seriously injured.  A RED-HEADED WOMAN sits 
           beside him, holding his hand and stroking his hair.

                                 NORWEGIAN WOMAN
                            (louder)
                        Please, someone, I really need to 
                        use the toilet. 

           Maria turns to the redhead.

                                 MARIA
                        Excuse me, please...

           The redhead turns to Maria and gives her a look of pity.  She 
           turns back to the man, pretending she didn’t see her. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Please, could you...

                                 RED-HEADED WOMAN
                        I’m taking care of my boyfriend, 
                        leave me alone!

           Maria is taken aback by the woman’s reaction.  A CHUBBY WOMAN 
           in her early thirties appears wearing a British football 
           jersey with a phonendoscope and bottles of serum.  She heads 
           for the dead woman’s bed and closes her eyes.  The spider 
           disappears under the sheets.  Maria calls her.  

                                 MARIA
                        Excuse me, ma’am...

           The nurse covers the woman’s body with a sheet.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                            (to Lucas)
                        What team is that jersey from?

                                 LUCAS
                        Manchester United.

                                 MARIA
                        Manchester Girl!

           The nurse turns, without moving.

                                 MANCHESTER GIRL
                        Be with you soon, no worry!

           She takes the pulse of the woman behind the curtain.  She 
           quickly closes the curtain so that nobody will see her. 
           But we see her shadow behind the curtain, covering her with a 
           sheet. 

           She comes out and signals for two orderlies to remove the 
           woman’s body as she takes her case history from a clipboard 
           hanging from the bed.  She puts a sticker over the file that 
           reads DECEASED.  Another nurse takes the file, leaving the 
           clipboard empty.

           Lucas stares at the empty clipboard hanging from the woman’s 
           bed as if hypnotized. 

                                 MARIA
                        Lucas.

           Lucas looks at his mother.  She takes his hand.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me.  I want you to 
                        promise me that no matter what, 
                        you’ll never let anyone take you to 
                        identify a body.

           Lucas doesn’t respond. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Swear to me, Lucas.  Never ever.  
                        Please, I’m begging you.

           Lucas nods.  She lets go of his hand. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I think the antibiotics are taking 
                        effect.  I feel better.

           She points at the Norwegian woman. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        That woman needs your help.  See if 
                        there’s anything you can do.

                                 LUCAS
                        No way, I’m staying right here.

           Maria looks at him sternly.  Lucas lowers his eyes.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Okay.

           Lucas walks over to the Norwegian woman.  He finds her crying 
           in silence.  Her mattress is wet. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Need any help?
           The woman is ashamed and takes a moment to speak.

                                 NORWEGIAN WOMAN
                        You think you could find me some 
                        paper towels?

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Lucas opens the stall doors searching for toilet paper, but 
           there’s none left.  He opens the last stall where he finds a 
           BLOND LITTLE GIRL with glasses, who is startled by him.

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Don’t you know you’re supposed to 
                        knock?

           The girl shouts at him and kicks the stall door shut. 

           INT. MAIN ENTRANCE / STOCK ROOM - DAY

           Lucas hurries to the small stock room where his mother was 
           treated.  He finds an ELDERLY THAI WOMAN with a swollen face 
           and a smashed jaw.  TWO YOUNG WOMEN and a THAI BOY the same 
           age as Lucas are with her. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I need some paper towels.

           The woman smiles back at him without understanding.  They put 
           their hands together and lower their heads to greet him.  
           They take up all the space in the tiny stockroom.  Lucas 
           slides past them to reach a roll of toilet paper.  He  rolls 
           out a long piece.  He discreetly glances behind him.  One of 
           the young women chews a piece of bread and puts it in the 
           elderly woman’s mouth, who swallows with difficulty.  Lucas 
           has second thoughts and takes a shorter piece of toilet 
           paper. 

           The elderly woman says something to her daughter, who takes a 
           tangerine out of her bag and offers it to Lucas.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

                                 THAI WOMAN
                        Kob hun kha.

           Lucas isn’t sure he understands.  He smiles politely.
           INT. LARGE ROOM, HOSPITAL - DAY

           Lucas hands the Norwegian woman the toilet paper.

                                 LUCAS
                        I didn’t take much.  They’re using 
                        it for bandages now.

           The woman smiles at him, grateful.

                                 NORWEGIAN WOMAN
                        Thank you so much.

           Lucas leaves the woman and walks over to his mother’s bed. 

           From afar we see Maria, immobile and with her eyes closed. 

           Lucas approaches and kneels quietly beside her.  He focuses 
           his attention on her chest, which rises and drops as she 
           breathes easily.  He looks at her injuries.  They’re still 
           swollen and the red and blue areas are spreading.  Lucas 
           strokes her hair softly , now crusty from the dried mud. 

           He looks at another hospital bed where a SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER 
           is holding the hand of a YOUNG WOMAN who is having difficulty 
           breathing.  Lucas doesn’t understand what they’re saying, but 
           it’s clearly a farewell.

                                 SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER
                            (with tears in his eyes)
                        It’s all right, love.  It’s all 
                        right.

           Tears stream down the old man’s cheeks.  He whispers a 
           lullaby into the young woman’s ear. 

                                 SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
                        Sleep my love, and peace attend 
                        thee all through the night... 
                        Guardian angels God will lend thee, 
                        all through the night...

           The young woman looks at him with peace in her eyes and 
           smiles at him gratefully.

           Lucas looks around. 

                                 SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Soft the drowsy hours are creeping, 
                        hill and vale in slumber steeping, 
                        I my loving vigil keeping, all 
                        through the night. 
           Tourists and local families pass from bed to bed, turning 
           their heads, checking for loved one.  A nurse embraces a 
           woman who weeps inconsolably.  A man with broken legs watches 
           the front door, hoping to spot a familiar face.  Another man 
           is standing in the middle of the room, unable to move, 
           stunned, exhausted.

           Lucas turns and looks at the old man as he finishes singing. 

           The woman exhales deeply and closes her eyes. 

           The old man looks up and surprises Lucas.  The two of them 
           share a very intimate moment. 

           Lucas turns towards the door.  The blonde girl with glasses 
           from the bathroom is standing in the doorway, watching him.  
           After a moment, she walks off, disappearing into the 
           corridor. 

           INT. LARGE ROOM - LATER

           A tourist heads for Maria’s bed.  Lucas turns his mother’s 
           head face-up so that nobody will bother her.  She wakes up.

                                 MARIA
                        What time is it?

           Lucas looks at the woman beside him.  She’s wearing a watch 
           covered in mud.  We see the second hand moving through the 
           glass. 

                                 LUCAS
                        It’s two-thirty. 

           Maria tries to sit up and look at her leg, but her open 
           wounds hurt too much.  She lies back. 

                                 MARIA
                        What color is my leg?

                                 LUCAS
                        It’s still red.  What does that 
                        mean?

                                 MARIA
                        It’s good, Lucas.  AS long as it 
                        doesn’t turn black, we’re fine. 

           Lucas takes the tangerine out of his shorts.

                                 LUCAS
                        Here.  Somebody gave me this.
           Lucas offers Maria the tangerine, but she rejects it and 
           turns to the woman beside her.  She gestures for Lucas to 
           share the tangerine with her.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Mom, you’re too weak.  You need to 
                        eat. 

                                 MARIA
                        I shouldn’t be eating right now.  
                        And she’s alone.

           Lucas approaches the woman with reticence.  She doesn’t 
           react. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        My name is Maria.  This is my son 
                        Lucas.  What is your name?

           The woman doesn’t respond.  Lucas checks the board and finds 
           her name.  

                                 LUCAS
                        It says her name is Simonne.

           The name returns Maria to reality.

                                 MARIA
                        I can’t call you Simonne.  My son’s 
                        name was Simon.

           Maria can’t say another word.  Lucas offers Simonne a slice 
           of the tangerine. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Here.  Eat something. 

           The woman continues to stare up at the ceiling and starts to 
           wince with pain.  She coughs.  She panics and starts gagging. 

                                 MARIA
                        You should put her face to the 
                        side. 

           Manchester Girl watches the scene from a bed nearby.  The 
           woman’s gagging grows worse.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Please, turn your head or you’ll 
                        choke...
                            (pause)
                        Lucas, turn her...
           Before Maria can finish her sentence the woman starts 
           vomiting a thick, black liquid and starts to choke on it.  
           Manchester Girl runs over to her and incorporates her, at 
           which point Simonne sprays Lucas with vomit. 

           The vomit splatters Maria, who tries not to gag. 

           Unsuccessfully.

           Maria starts throwing up the same black liquid.  What looks 
           like a branch hangs from her mouth and she has trouble 
           breathing, half suffocating. 

           Manchester Girl lets go of Simonne and she rushes over to 
           help Maria, softly tugging at the branch little by little as 
           it becomes a tangle of straw and leaves that seems to never 
           end, like some macabre magic trick. 

           Another gag sprays Lucas with black liquid.  Maria vomits and 
           shakes violently.  Manchester Girl stands behind her and 
           gives her the Heimlich, further opening the wounds in her 
           ribs.  But Maria spits out the ball of dead leaves. 

           Simonne has stopped vomiting.  Lucas is pale.

                                 LUCAS
                        Damn it, Mom, that’s enough!

           Maria turns over and tries to catch her breath.  Lucas stands 
           there looking at her, soaked in vomit and trembling. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, boy!  I’d like some of that 
                        tangerine, if you still have it.

           Lucas turns and finds a YOUNG PATIENT watching from a few 
           beds away.  Lucas hands her what’s left of the tangerine, 
           which he has unwittingly squeezed into a mash of pulp. 

                                 MARIA
                        They’re way too busy.  See if you 
                        can do anything to help. 

                                 LUCAS
                        What do you want me to do?

           Maria looks at him compassionately.

                                 MARIA
                        Whatever you can. 
           INT. ROOM 2 - DAY

           A group of volunteers rips sheets to use them as bandages.  
           Others start preparing lists with names of patients as they 
           ask about missing family members.  Lucas goes from bed to bed 
           asking people if they need help.  Most of the injured are 
           either completely out of it or don’t even hear him.  Others, 
           the less seriously injured, scream and complain but never ask 
           him for anything. 

           A woman signals for him to come over.  Lucas obeys.  She 
           whispers something in his ear which we cannot hear. 

           We heard a huge commotion outside.  Lucas walks out to the 
           corridor. 

           INT. MAIN ENTRANCE, HOSPITAL - DAY

           A huge crowd of tourists and locals rush to a few volunteers 
           with bottles of water.  Total chaos.  Uninjured tourists take 
           as many bottles as they can carry, others who are injured 
           can’t reach the volunteers through the crowd.  Lucas watches 
           the scene.  The group quickly dissolves, leaving the empty 
           box on the floor. 

           A BULK MAN appears in the middle of the crowd.  He’s asking 
           everybody something Lucas can’t make out until he reaches 
           him.

                                 BULKY MAN
                        Benstrom?

                                 LUCAS
                        Can I help you?

           The man kneels before Lucas and shows him a family photo, of 
           himself with his wife and two children, a boy and a girl.  
           The man points at each one of them. 

                                 BULKY MAN
                        Benstrom. Joseph Benstrom.  Morten
                        Benstrom.  Agda Benstrom.

                                 LUCAS
                        You’re looking for your family.

           The man nods. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll help you.
           INT. OTHER HOSPITAL ROOMS - DAY

           Lucas is holding a piece of paper on which he’s written 
           BENSTROM.  He stops before each bed, checking each patient’s 
           face and asking over and over again.

                                 LUCAS
                        Benstrom?  Benstrom? Do you know a 
                        Benstrom from Sweden?

           Nobody seems to understand him, but Lucas remains upbeat and 
           rushes from room to room as if each second was golden. 

           Some of them ask him about other names, and Lucas writes them 
           down on the back of his piece of paper just in case. 

           The list begins to grow. 

           Boonmee, Benstrom, Castorini, Larralde, Ackerman, D’Auvigne.

           INT. CHILDREN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Lucas finds another room similar to his mother’s.  He hurries 
           from bed to bed like a travelling salesman, calling out the 
           names from the list.

                                 LUCAS
                        Benstrom?  Benstrom from Sweden?

                                 BOY
                        Jag är Morten Benstrom.  Har du 
                        sett min far?

           Lucas stops.  A BOY gestures for him to come closer.  The 
           boy’s face is so badly bruised and swollen we can’t even tell 
           his race. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Morten Benstrom?

           The boy nods and starts to cry. 

                                 MORTEN
                        Var är min familiy?  Har nagon 
                        dött?

           Lucas shakes his head and smiles broadly to keep from crying. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Your dad is here.  It’s all right.  
                        All right.

           Morten starts looking around, searching. 
                                 MORTEN
                        Pappa?  Pappa!

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           Lucas runs through the crowd.  In the distance, walking up a 
           ramp that connects the first floor of the hospital with the 
           street, he spots Benstrom.

                                 LUCAS
                        Mr. Benstrom!!

           Benstrom doesn’t hear him.  Lucas runs as fast as he can.  
           Finally he reaches Benstrom. He gives him a tug on his shirt 
           and smiles as brightly as he can. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Your son is here!

           INT. CHILDREN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Through the glass, Lucas watches as father and son embrace.  
           Their eyes are red from having cried a lot.  Lucas smiles, 
           satisfied.  

           He suddenly has an idea and rushes out. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           Lucas runs down the corridor towards the main room, with a 
           hopeful smile on his face.

           INT. LARGE ROOM - NIGHT

           Lucas reaches the room and rushes to his mother’s bed.

           It’s empty.  A blank clipboard hangs from the headboard.  
           There’s no sign of his mother’s file. 

           He looks at Simonne’s wristwatch.  It’s 4 in the afternoon. 

                                 LUCAS
                            (to Simonne)
                        Where’s my mom?  Where did they 
                        take her?

           Simonne is still out of it.  She doesn’t answer.  She doesn’t 
           even react to the boy.
           He sees a couple of orderlies bringing in a new patient.  
           They place her in Maria’s bed.  A nurse takes away the 
           clipboard hanging from the bed and replaces it with another.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                            (shouting)
                        No!  This bed is taken!  This bed 
                        is taken!

           Other patients sit up and look at Lucas, alarmed by his 
           shouting. 

           Lucas nervously tries to gather his thoughts.  He looks 
           around for someone who might help him, but doesn’t recognize 
           anyone.  He rushes out into the corridor. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS - DAY

           Lucas runs down the corridor, opening doors on each side 
           until he reaches a corridor where several seriously injured 
           patients on gurneys are waiting for surgery.  A nurse 
           protests loudly and runs after him.

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m looking for my mom.  Where’s my 
                        mom?

           The nurse shakes her head and leads Lucas out of the O.R.

           INT. ROOM 2 - DAY

           Lucas runs through the room, checking each bed.

           Some patients recognize Lucas and call him to give him names 
           to add to the list.  Lucas pays no attention, he just keeps 
           running. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS - DAY

           Lucas desperately runs through the corridors.  Finally he 
           stops, not knowing where to look.

           INT. MAIN ENTRANCE, HOSPITAL - DAY

           Lucas rests on a bench.  He looks for any familiar face.  He 
           recognizes one of the orderlies that was transporting bodies 
           earlier.  He stops in front of a board in the main entrance.  
           He removes a piece of paper and sticks it on another board. 
           Several people immediately check the paper.  Lucas gets up 
           and walks over. 

           Something catches Lucas’ eye.  Under the column “ARRIVALS” we 
           can still read “LUCAS BENNETT - ENGLAND / JAPAN,” but Maria’s 
           name is no longer beside it. 

           Lucas checks the floor.  He looks up at the list of 
           “DECEASED” and takes a few steps closer for a better look. 

           Lucas stops in his tracks. 

           Pinned to the list, with four or five other names, is his 
           mother’s name written in his own handwriting.

           Lucas spots a THAI VOLUNTEER copying names from the board on 
           a form. 

           Lucas turns, desperate.  He sees the nurse who was 
           transporting a body turn a corner down a ramp.

           INT. ACCESS RAMP TO MORGUE - DAY

           Lucas walks down the ramp, following the nurse to the floor 
           below.  There aren’t any people around.  He reaches a door to 
           a corridor where the sounds of the hospital seem to disappear 
           completely in a disturbing void. 

           A couple of orderlies enter pushing a gurney.  They look 
           extremely afflicted.  The nurse disappears behind the 
           swinging doors. 

           Lucas remains still.  He hears voices talking down the hall.  
           Then, as if hypnotized, he gets up and walks towards the 
           swinging doors, still rocking. 

           We have a momentary view of a corridor divided by several 
           different sets of swinging doors.  It’s filled with white 
           body bags.  We glimpse a few stiff limbs sticking out.  Other 
           bags are closed.  In the background, more bodies.  Some on 
           the floor.  Some covered, others not. 

           It’s a horrifying image.  Lucas doesn’t go any further.

           The silence is broken by a distant conversation between two 
           volunteers. 

                                 VOLUNTEER 1
                        There’s no more room here.  I hear 
                        they’re moving the bodies to Wat
                        Yarn Wao for identification. 
                                 VOLUNTEER 2
                        I can’t believe this.  I hear 
                        Phuket is gone.

                                 VOLUNTEER 1
                        What do you mean, gone?

           Another volunteer approaches Lucas from behind. 

                                 VOLUNTEER 2
                        Are you looking for someone, kid?

           Lucas looks desperate. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Nobody.  She made me promise.

           INT. MAIN ENTRANCE, HOSPITAL - DAY

           Lucas walks aimlessly, in a daze.  He stops in the middle of 
           a sea of people moving in all directions. 

           He walks towards the main entrance.  He passes the barrier to 
           take a look outside.

           It looks like a refugee camp out there. 

           EXT. CLEARING OUTSIDE HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON

           The area in front of the hospital is full of tents where the 
           injured are treated and their families are sheltered.  Dozens 
           of volunteers unload assorted medical supplies.  Others 
           unload computers and printers.  Bulletin boards have been 
           prepared with lists of names. 

           A helicopter unloads medical supplies, medicine and other 
           supplies. 

           Lucas wanders through the chaos like a soul in mourning. 

           A hand touches his shoulder.  He turns.

           The Scottish grandfather we saw earlier, now wearing a 
           volunteer’s vest. 

                                 WALLACE 
                        Hi.  I’m Wallace.  Are you lost?

                                 LUCAS
                        I lost my mother.

           Wallace holds out his hand.
                                 WALLACE
                        Come with me.

           Lucas hesitates.  Wallace reaches out to him. 

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Let me help you. 

           Lucas takes his hand and walks off with him.

           Lucas and Wallace walk through the crowd. 

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                            (very friendly)
                        What’s your name?

                                 LUCAS
                        Lucas.

           INT. CHILDREN’S TENT - LATE AFTERNOON

           We see dozens of children, all of them alone, each with a 
           sticker with their name written on their chest.  Some of them 
           are crying, others play happily, the smallest are inside a 
           giant playpen. 

           Two volunteers exchange papers behind a counter.  Wallace 
           picks up a blank piece of paper and sits with Lucas. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Where are you staying?

                                 LUCAS
                        At the Orchid Beach Resort.

                                 WALLACE
                        So you’ve lost your mom...

           Lucas nods. 

                                 LUCAS
                        She asked me to help in any way I 
                        could... I helped this man find his 
                        son.  I wanted to tell her, she 
                        would have been so happy... But 
                        when I came back to the room 
                        someone had taken the board with 
                        her file and they were putting 
                        someone in her place.  I should 
                        have stayed there.

           Wallace looks at the boy sympathetically. 
                                 WALLACE
                        I’ll see if I can find out where 
                        you mom is.

                                 LUCAS
                        I saw her name on the deceased 
                        list.
                            (desperate)
                        I don’t know what to do.

                                 WALLACE
                        What’s your mom’s name?

                                 LUCAS
                        Maria Bennett.  We’re from England, 
                        but we live in Japan.

           Wallace writes down everything Lucas says. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Any other members of your family 
                        with you?

           Lucas shakes his head.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        You’re a brave little man.

                                 LUCAS
                            (sharply)
                        No, I’m not.

           Wallace takes a sticker out of his vest pocket and writes 
           Lucas’ name on it.  The boy soaks in what this means.  

                                 WALLACE
                        Yes, you are.  It takes courage to 
                        admit you’re afraid.

           They look into each other’s eyes a moment.

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m sorry about your granddaughter.

           Wallace smiles at the boy.

                                 WALLACE
                        She wasn’t my granddaughter.

           Lucas looks at Wallace without understanding.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know her.  She was alone, 
                        and I tried to comfort her. 
                                 LUCAS
                        Have you lost anyone?

                                 WALLACE
                        I haven’t lost anyone.  Not here.
                            (pause)
                        Stay here. 

           Wallace gets up.  Lucas remains seated, unsure of what to do.  
           The wind picks up, lifting the canvas of the tend, revealing 
           the outside at intervals.  Something attracts his attention 
           outside.  He gets up and walks to the gap. 

           Daniel, the boy they rescued from the tree, is outside.  He’s 
           smiling and goofing off in the arms of a TOURIST sitting in a 
           pick-up.  The man smiles at the boy with tears in his eyes as 
           he strokes him.  

           Lucas ducks under the canvas and walks towards Daniel.

           The engine starts.  Lucas stops and watches as Daniel drives 
           off. 

           Right then, Lucas spots a HOTEL EMPLOYEE walking through the 
           crowd wearing the uniform we saw the day before. 

           Lucas looks at him like he’s from another world.  The 
           employee walks through a crowd of injured people covered with 
           mud, his uniform completely clean from the knees up.

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        Orchid Beach Resort?  Anyone here 
                        from Orchid Beach Resort?

           Lucas hesitates a moment.  He looks inside the tent.  Wallace 
           is busy with some papers.  He looks outside again.  The man 
           is gone but we can still hear his voice in the distance. 

           EXT. CLEARING OUTSIDE HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON

           Lucas follows the hotel employee’s voice through the crowd.  
           He spots him and rushes over to him. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Sir, I was at the Orchid Beach 
                        Resort with my family.

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        Name?

                                 LUCAS
                            (very nervous)
                        Lucas Bennett.
           The employee looks at him obliviously.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        L-U-C-A-S...

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        Lu-cas?

           Lucas nods.

                                 LUCAS
                        B-E-N-N-E-T-T.

           The employee crinkles his brow.  Lucas grows impatient and 
           grabs the papers from him. 

           It’s a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy.  It’s very 
           hard to read.  Under the heading “MISSING” we see a long list 
           of names.  Each his written in different handwriting.

           Lucas spots his own name and his mother’s.  His face lights 
           up.  Thoughts race through his mind.

           Wallace approaches Lucas.

                                 WALLACE
                        You should stay in the tent...

                                 LUCAS
                            (very nervous)
                        My dad is looking for me!

                                 WALLACE
                        How do you know it’s your dad?

                                 LUCAS
                        This is my dad’s handwriting. 

           EXT. DEVASTATED AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

           A pair of bare feet covered in blood walk with difficulty 
           through debris, broken glass and broken tree branches.  They 
           belong to a man using a stick to help him walk.

           The man turns and we see it’s Henry.  One of his eyes has 
           blood inside it.

                                 HENRY
                            (screams with a weak 
                             voice)
                        Lucas!  Lucas!
           His tiny figure stands alone in the huge, empty clearing 
           covered with the scattered remains of different hotels.  Some 
           trees are still standing, others have fallen and others have 
           been uprooted and dragged away. 

           Henry shouts with what little voice he has left.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Maria!  Maria!

           Though he’s wearing a bathing suit, Henry’s legs are so full 
           of cuts and bruises that from this distance it looks like 
           he’s wearing red pants.  He wanders aimlessly, unsure what 
           do, passing a DEVASTATED TOURIST weeping inconsolably beside 
           a bicycle buried in the mud. 

           A staircase leading nowhere is the only structure left 
           standing in the ruins.  Henry walks up the steps, exhausted, 
           and stops at the top.  He can see the Orchid Beach Resort.

           EXT. SWIMMING POOL AREA - SUNSET

           Inside a hotel room, hanging from a cord, we see several 
           passports and bills drying in the sun.  The walls are 
           destroyed from halfway down, where we can see the mark left 
           by the level the water reached.  We see Henry approaching in 
           the distance through the small balcony.

           The water has raised the pool deck and dragged the bungalow 
           structures.  Henry walks through the debris.  His feet are so 
           bloody they don’t hurt anymore. 

           We start to hear the sound of voices.  A couple has arranged 
           children’s clothing on the ground, covered in mud, 
           reconstructing the outline of two bodies on the ground.  A 
           woman with a lost look on her face sitting on the porch, 
           holding a child in her arms.  The child isn’t moving.  Or 
           breathing. 

           Henry walks by the swimming pool.  Somewhat scared, he 
           approaches the edge and looks inside.  The bottom of the 
           empty pool is visible through the water, which is 
           surprisingly clear.

           Henry runs into another TOURIST he knows.

                                 TOURIST
                        Any luck with your family?

           Henry shakes his head.

                                 HENRY
                        No news around here?
                                 TOURIST
                        Nothing yet.  I’m sorry.

                                 HENRY
                        We need to get some light and food 
                        up to the roof.  It’ll be dark 
                        soon.

                                 TOURIST
                        We can’t stay.  There’s another 
                        tidal wave warning tonight.

                                 HENRY
                        What?

           Henry’s mind is racing.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Where is everybody?

                                 TOURIST
                        A lot of people have left.  The 
                        ones still here are waiting to be 
                        picked up.

           Henry doesn’t pay much attention to him.  He runs towards the 
           stairs, with his eyes on the roof. 

                                 TOURIST (CONT’D)
                        We’re all leaving, man.  It’s no 
                        use staying here.

           INT. HOTEL STAIRS - EVENING

           The stairs are in awful shape.  Henry struggles to make it 
           upstairs.

           Little by little the steps regain their original shape, until 
           we reach the third floor, where everything is strangely 
           intact. 

           INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - EVENING

           Henry limps down the corridor.  A FAMILY of tourists walks by 
           him with their luggage.  They’re clean and wearing clean 
           clothes and they pay no attention to him.  This woman is 
           carrying an iron.

           He walks past a breakfast tray on the floor that someone left 
           outside their door.  A WOMAN covered in mud discreetly lifts 
           the top of the tray to see what’s inside.  We see a plastic 
           bag with chocolates and drinks from the minibar.
           INT. ROOM WITH HOLE IN ROOF - EVENING

           Henry enters a room with a hole cracked open to the roof.  
           Someone stacked the furniture in the room to create an 
           improvised staircase to gain access to the roof. 

           On the floor we see a fire extinguisher covered with plaster 
           and dust. 

           Henry climbs the furniture.  He’s almost reached the hole 
           when he feels a sharp pain in his back and drops to his 
           knees.  The chair that was the last stair falls with him. 

           Henry gets up.  He sees a mattress in a corner of the room 
           and lies on it to catch his breath. 

           A head appears through the hole in the roof.

                                 AMERICAN TOURIST
                        Hey, man.  You all right?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m fine.  I just need to lie down 
                        a minute.  I’ll be up in a sec. 

                                 AMERICAN TOURIST
                        Don’t even bother climbing up.  
                        They’re taking us all to the 
                        mountains.  They’ll be here soon.

                                 HENRY
                        I know...

           Henry looks like he’s about to faint.  He takes a deep breath 
           and catches his breath. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Can you tell them I’m back? 

           The tourist nods and disappears.  The camera rises slowly up 
           to the hole.  The sun peeks out as we approach.  Finally we 
           see Thomas.  Simon appears next to him.  They both look 
           perfectly fine, but we see Thomas is extremely worried.

                                 SIMON
                        A whole bunch of helicopters just 
                        flew by!

                                 THOMAS
                        Mom and Lucas?

           Silence.
                                 HENRY
                        I still haven’t found them. 

           We see the disappointment in Simon’s face.  And something 
           more in Thomas’: distrust.

                                 THOMAS
                        You said you’d be back in a couple 
                        hours and it’s almost nighttime. 

                                 HENRY
                        Thomas, come down here for a 
                        second. 

                                 SIMON
                        What about me?

                                 HENRY
                        Keep watch for more helicopters. 

           Simon nods.  The American tourist helps Thomas climb down, 
           which he does carefully and somewhat scared.  Once he’s down 
           he sits on the mattress beside his father. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Does it hurt?

                                 HENRY
                        No, I just need to lie down for a 
                        second.

           Henry lies back on the mattress with great care.  He sighs, 
           relieved.  They remain silent a moment. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Did you see a lot of dead people?

                                 HENRY
                        What happened is very serious, 
                        Thomas.

                                 THOMAS
                        But not Mom and Lucas, right?

                                 HENRY
                        No.  I haven’t seen them. 

           Henry checks Thomas’ wounds.  He has several cuts on his legs 
           and ribs but they don’t look serious.  Thomas shows him his 
           feet. 
                                 THOMAS
                        I burned my fee on the roof... It 
                        was really hot and everybody was 
                        leaving.  Can we leave yet?  We 
                        should go to a hospital and get you 
                        looked at. 

                                 HENRY
                        I can’t rest until I know where Mom 
                        and Lucas are.
                            (pause)
                        You need to do me a favor.

           Thomas remains silent. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Look, I hear they’re taking us to a 
                        shelter in the mountains, but I 
                        can’t go with you.  I have to keep 
                        looking.  You have to help me 
                        tonight, kid.  I need you to take 
                        care of Simon.

                                 THOMAS
                        No.  Stay with us.

           Henry takes Thomas’ hand.  We see how painful it is for him 
           to ask this of his son.

                                 HENRY
                        I have to keep looking.

                                 THOMAS
                        Then we’ll look for them together.

                                 HENRY
                        I can’t take you two with me.

                                 THOMAS
                        You can’t leave us alone again.  
                        You promised you’d be back before 
                        nightfall and that you’d stay. 

                                 HENRY
                        I know you understand. 

           Thomas doesn’t respond.  He’s very scared. 

           We hear a car horn honk outside.  The American tourist peeks 
           out of the hole in the roof.

                                 AMERICAN TOURIST
                        They’re here!
                                 HENRY
                        Thomas.  Please.

           EXT. ENTRANCE, ORCHID BEACH RESORT - NIGHT

           Thomas walks with a sever face.  He’s holding Henry’s hand 
           while Henry carries Simon in his other arm.  We can still see 
           a faint light on the horizon. Tourists from the hotel are 
           getting into pick-up trucks.  Among them we see the married 
           couple Henry saw on the stairs.  They’re screaming at one of 
           the hotel employees.  The argument is interrupted when the 
           tourist receives a call on his cell phone.  Henry can’t 
           believe his eyes.  He walks towards the couple with the boys. 

                                 HENRY
                        Are you all right, have you lost 
                        someone?

           She gestures for him not to come any closer.

                                 DARK WOMAN
                        We’re fine, we just want out of 
                        here.

           Henry looks at her a moment.

                                 HENRY
                        You see, I’ve been trying all day 
                        to place a call to England...

           The man gives Henry a nasty look.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me... Listen, if I could 
                        please use your phone just for a 
                        minute, I’ve lost my...

                                 AMERICAN TOURIST
                            (interrupting)
                        Sorry, pal.  My battery is almost 
                        out and I need this phone.

           Henry stares at him.  Something jumps out at him: while his 
           own feet are covered in blood, the tourists wearing what look 
           like brand new sneakers with very little mud on them.  He’s 
           standing beside a large suitcase.

                                 HENRY
                        I hate to bother you but I’ve been 
                        looking for my wife and kid all day 
                        and my feet hurt.  If you could 
                        spare a pair of sneakers...
           The American drops his manners and gets serious.

                                 AMERICAN TOURIST
                        Just what part of FUCK OFF don’t 
                        you understand?

           Henry stares up at him in disbelieve.  He turns and heads for 
           the pick-up.

           A SWEDISH TOURIST who witnessed the scene walks over to Henry 
           and gives him his flip flops with the hotel logo on them.  
           Thomas and Simon smile at him.

                                 SWEDISH TOURIST
                        Here, you can have these.  It’s all 
                        I have. 

           Henry looks at the tourist.  His face reveals that he’s been 
           personally affected by the tragedy. 

                                 HENRY
                        Thank you.

           Henry puts on the flip flops.  They’re small on him but it’s 
           better than nothing.  He helps the boys get on one of the 
           pick-up trucks.

                                 SIMON
                        You’re not coming, Dad?

           The pick-up starts.

                                 THOMAS
                        Dad has to find Mom and Lucas.  
                        I’ll take care of you.

           Henry smiles, proud and touched.  He sees a WOMAN looking at 
           him with sad eyes.  She has a peculiar look about her.  Her 
           hair is dyed an orange-pinkish color. 

                                 HENRY
                        Could you please keep an eye on my 
                        kids?

           The woman nods.

                                 AMERICAN TOURIST
                            (to Henry)
                        Come with us.  You know it’s 
                        useless.

           Henry looks at him.  His face is broken by fatigue, but love 
           and hope continue to flicker in his eyes. 
                                 HENRY
                        I have no choice. 

           The pick-up drives off.  Henry watches it in the distance.  
           The boys wave goodbye.

           Now Henry is on his own.

           EXT. DEVASTATED AREA - NIGHT

           A full moon.  Henry walks through a swampy area.  He’s 
           holding a flashlight, the only light in the darkness.  The 
           mud is up to his knees.  His flip flops are getting stuck in 
           the mud, making it hard for him to walk.  He kicks them off. 

                                 HENRY
                        Maria!  Lucas!

           EXT. RUINS - NIGHT

           Henry enters what’s left of the hotel lobby.  Everything 
           feels like a nightmare.  The ground is covered with all kinds 
           of debris.  He lights it up with the flashlight.

           A trail of debris with a fallen electricity wire on one side.  
           The posts and wires look like a barbed wire fence alongside 
           an eerie path.  Henry walks to the end, where beside an 
           electric cable box there’s a mass of shredded fabric rocking 
           in the night breeze.  Henry thinks he can make out two human 
           figures trapped inside. 

           The two bodies are hooked to some fabric.  They look like a 
           giant insect cocoon.  A hand is sticking out in a gesture of 
           desperation. 

           Henry walks over to them, puts down the flashlight and starts 
           to unravel the layers.  The fabric tears and opens.  Water, 
           mud and a large, bulky mass fall to the ground.

           Two bodies clinging to each other.  It’s dark but we can tell 
           the corpses are very swollen.  They roll down into a huge 
           pond of stagnant water with a solid layer of scattered debris 
           and bodies floating on the surface. 

           Henry walks down into it without thinking.  He lets his feet 
           slide in the mud.  Suddenly he sinks completely.  He 
           struggles and manages to get on his feet.  The flashlight is 
           wet and starts losing intensity.  He moves among the bodies, 
           turning them over.  His face is black from the mud.  His 
           white eyes, wide open from the shock, stand out in the 
           darkness. 
           Henry thinks he hears something snap. 

           Something moves quickly in the water.  Henry turns but can’t 
           see anything.  His breathing speeds up. 

           Silence.

           We hear something moving quickly in the water again.  Henry 
           turns just in time to see what looks like a snake disappear 
           into the roots of the tree. 

           Henry is terrified.  The flashlight goes out completely.

           EXT. CAMP IN THE MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

           Dozens of people are resting around campfires high up in the 
           hills.  Some of them are asleep.  Others tell each other 
           stories around the campfires. 

           Simon is sleeping at Thomas’ feet.  Thomas takes a roll of 
           toilet paper and uses it to make a pillow.  Simon’s arms and 
           hands are covered with bites.  He scratches them constantly. 

                                 SIMON
                        Get these ants off me...

           Thomas looks at his brother.  There aren’t any ants on him.  
           He’s talking in his sleep.  He puts the toilet paper pillow 
           under his head. 

           Suddenly we hear the sound of an animal howling in the 
           jungle.  It’s a pitiful sound.  Simon opens his eyes. 

           He looks into the jungle with fear in his eyes.  He turns, 
           seeking his brother’s warmth.

           Thomas looks at the sky.

           He can see the stars shining through the branches of a tree.

           He looks up at them with tears in his eyes.

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           We come down from the stars and find Henry.  He’s limping 
           along the side of a devastated highway.

           A pick-up approaches from behind him.  He raises his arms. 
           INT. ENTRANCE, BUS STATION - NIGHT

           We see a table with mini-bottles of alcohol from a minibar, 
           toiletries with hotel logos on them, bottles of water, 
           newspapers cut into strips... On the ground we see several 
           suitcases with piles of clothes and shoes.  People take 
           whatever they need from the pile. 

           Henry is lying on a gurney.  A nurse uses a cigarette lighter 
           to sterilize a needle.  The woman takes out a box of dental 
           floss and cuts a long string. 

                                 HENRY
                        Is it necessary? I have to look for 
                        my wife and kid.

           The woman touches his chest and smiles kindly.

                                 NURSE
                        You have several broken ribs.  I’ll 
                        give you some painkillers.  But you 
                        need to get some rest. 

           She picks up a mini-bottle of vodka and pours the liquid on 
           Henry’s eyebrow.  He winces in pain from the sting. 

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        This may hurt a little. 

           The nurse starts stitching Henry’s lip.  He doesn’t flinch. 

           INT. BUS STATION - NIGHT

           Henry is lying on the floor.  People try to rest around him.  
           We hear someone snoring peacefully.  Henry stares at the 
           clock on the wall.  The second pass.  We hear a radio in the 
           distance. 

                                 RADIO (O.S.)
                        ...international help is on the way 
                        while locals have taken to the 
                        mountains, fearing an aftershock 
                        may cause another wave...

           Henry walks through the bus station, unable to sleep.  He 
           passes a group of men speaking in low voices.  One of them, 
           JOAKIM (38), his legs in a plaster cast, looks at Henry.  
           Beside him we see Ferdinand, the German boy with the 
           prosthetic arm.  He’s lost his prosthesis and his stump is 
           exposed.  He’s sitting beside his father, DIETER (45). 

           Henry walks over and sits down, joining the group.  JOAKIM is 
           finishing his story. 
                                 JOAKIM
                        I broke my leg on a trecking
                        excursion two days ago.  My wife 
                        and kids were on the beach.  I was 
                        on the balcony.  I saw the whole 
                        thing, but I had no time to react.  
                        There was nothing I could do.  I 
                        should have been by their side. 
                            (pause)
                        There’s so many things I wish I 
                        could say, so many things I’d like 
                        to take back. 

           The group remains silent.  Dieter looks at Henry. 

                                 DIETER
                        You were staying at the Orchid, 
                        right?

           Henry nods.

                                 DIETER (CONT’D)
                        Ferdinand and I were there with our 
                        family too.  We’re looking for my 
                        wife and two daughters.  My other 
                        son is dead. 

           The other men turn to Dieter.  Ferdinand puts his good arm 
           around his father’s shoulder.

           Dieter remains admirably calm.  Henry is deeply affected.  
           They all look at him, waiting for him to tell his story. 

           It’s the first time Henry has had to put it all together.  He 
           has trouble ordering his memories. 

                                 HENRY
                        The wave hit when my whole family 
                        was by the pool.  I found my two 
                        youngest kids.  Seven and five 
                        years old.  I found Thomas first.  
                        He was totally panicked.  Then I 
                        heard Simon screaming. I had to 
                        jump in the water to rescue him.  
                        He was barely hanging from a nearby 
                        tree, covered in ant bites.  There 
                        was this dead guy caught at the 
                        base of the tree.  He was so 
                        scared...
                            (pause)
                        But I had to leave them again.  I’m 
                        still looking for my wife and my 
                        nine-year-old.  Maria and Lucas.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        I don’t suppose any of you have 
                        heard of them, by any chance...

           The men shake their heads, looking sadly at Henry.

                                 JOAKIM
                            (to Henry)
                        Have you had any chance to call 
                        home already? 

                                 HENRY
                        I haven’t managed to call anyone 
                        all day.  Perhaps if my wife and 
                        kids are safe, they would have...

           Henry doesn’t need to continue.  Joakim takes a cell phone 
           out of his pocket. 

                                 JOAKIM
                        I’m saving my battery just in case 
                        my family calls.  But please.

           Joakim offers him the cell phone.  Henry is touched by the 
           gesture. 

                                 HENRY
                        I’ll make it quick, I promise.

           Henry quickly dials the number.  The seconds waiting feel 
           endless.  We hear a voice answer.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        George?

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                            (over telephone)
                        Yes, Henry, thank God.  How are you 
                        guys?

                                 HENRY
                        Has anybody called you?

           There’s an uncomfortable silence.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                            (over telephone)
                        No, Henry, you’re the first to 
                        call.  Is everybody all right?

                                 HENRY
                        Maria and Lucas are gone.
                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                            (nervous, over telephone)
                        What do you mean, gone?

           Silence.  Henry tries to be strong, but he falls apart and 
           starts crying like a little boy.

                                 HENRY
                            (sobbing)
                        The wave swept them all away.  I 
                        found Simon and Thomas, but I can’t 
                        find Maria.  I don’t know what to 
                        do, I don’t know where to look...

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                            (over telephone)
                        Take it easy Henry.  Calm down.

                                 HENRY
                        George, I’ll call you back as soon 
                        as I can.  A lot of people here 
                        need this phone. 

           Henry hangs up the phone and weeps inconsolably.  The men 
           around him put their arms around him, comforting him.  Henry 
           graciously accepts their encouragement. 

                                 DIETER
                        Don’t lose hope.  You have to stay 
                        strong.  We all have to.  Together. 

           Joakim looks at Henry.  He hold out the phone again. 

                                 HENRY
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 JOAKIM
                        You can’t leave it like that.

           Henry dries his tears. 

                                 JOAKIM (CONT’D)
                        Go on.  Call him back.

           Henry lets go of the others.  He takes the phone and dials 
           again.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                            (over telephone)
                        What is it, Henry?

                                 HENRY
                            (more composed)
                        George, it’s me again.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        I swear I won’t stop until I find 
                        them.  It’s nighttime, I don’t know 
                        what I’ll do, but I’ll check every 
                        hospital, every shelter.  I’ll find 
                        them. 

           EXT. PICK-UP - NIGHT

           Henry is sitting next to Joakim in a pick-up truck, speeding 
           along the road.  He looks determined. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S TENT - NIGHT

           Lucas sleeps on the ground surrounded by other children.  A 
           THAI BOY shifts and puts his arm around him.  Lucas lets him.

           It’s getting noisier outside, a growing nervous murmur.  The 
           wind shakes the canvas of the tent.  The headlights of a 
           passing car project the shadows of people running on the side 
           of the tent.  Lucas sits up. 

           He walks over to a crack in the tent, listening to people 
           talking outside.  He can’t make out what they’re saying, but 
           he can tell they’re upset about something. 

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Why are you here?

           Lucas turns.  It’s the little blonde girl with glasses we saw 
           earlier in the bathroom, wearing a sticker that reads: Marie.

           Marie looks at him.  She hesitates a moment. 

                                 MARIE
                        Why aren’t you inside, with your 
                        mom?

           Lucas turns very serious. 

                                 LUCAS
                        My mom is dead.

           Marie is confused. 

                                 MARIE
                        No she’s not.  I’ve seen her!

           A light ray of hope flickers in Lucas’ eyes.  The ruckus 
           outside grows louder.

                                 LUCAS
                        Where?
                                 MARIE
                        I’ll show you.

           EXT. CLEARING OUTSIDE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Lucas and Marie exit the tent.  There’s quite a stir of 
           people coming and going.  Some flee in terror as others run 
           toward the main entrance.

                                 VOICES 
                        The water is coming!  THE WATER IS 
                        COMING!  Run to the roof!

           The employees try to restore order, screaming in Thai and 
           gesturing for people to remain calm.  We see injured people 
           fleeing the hospital any way they can.

           The rumble gets louder and louder. 

           INT. MAIN ENTRANCE, HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Lucas, holding Maria’s hand, walks in front of the bulletin 
           boards.  Something catches his eye. 

           In the DECEASED column we see a small piece of paper with his 
           name on it: LUCAS BENNETT.

           Lucas lets go of Marie’s hand and approaches the board. 

           Lucas takes his name from the DECEASED column and hangs it in 
           the ADMISSIONS column.  Marie grabs his hand and pulls. 

                                 MARIE
                        Don’t waste time!

           Lucas is confused.  He puts the paper with his name on it in 
           his pocket.  He follow Marie. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           Marie runs with Lucas, who tries to avoid all the people 
           rushing past.  Seriously injured people on the floor in the 
           corridors reach out for help.  An old woman holds her hands 
           together in prayer. 

           They make their way against the crowd, heading for another 
           wing of the hospital.
           INT. ROOM 2 - NIGHT

           Marie leads Lucas inside a room that is half-empty.  The 
           patients here are too seriously injured to flee.  They hold 
           their hands out, pleading for help.  Marie and Lucas look 
           around the room.

           Maria isn’t there.

                                 LUCAS
                        I told you... She’s gone...

           Marie doesn’t react.

                                 MARIE
                        No, wait!

           Marie runs out of the room.  Lucas follows

           EXT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Lucas tries to keep up with Marie as she runs down a ramp, 
           against the stream of people trying to make it to the roof.  
           People flee in terror.  It’s hard to get through the crowd.  
           Marie stops. 

                                 MARIE
                        There’s no time.  We need to get to 
                        the roof.

           Marie turns, but Lucas squeezes her hand tightly.

                                 LUCAS
                        No, please.  Take me to my mom.  
                        Please!

           Marie thinks a moment.  She squeezes Lucas’ hand tightly.  We 
           see the two hands moving against the tide of people.  They 
           run through the corridors, reaching street level.  Marie 
           points at the pavilion where Maria was taken when she first 
           arrived. 

                                 MARIE
                        In there!

                                 LUCAS
                        But that’s where she was before.  
                        I’ve checked already. 

           Somebody pushes Lucas to the ground.  He gets up and runs 
           after Marie, who has already entered the room.
           INT. LARGE ROOM - NIGHT

           Lucas reaches the door, almost out of breath.  He turns in 
           the direction of Maria’s bed.  It’s still empty.  He looks 
           around for Marie.

           Marie is a few yards away, smiling ear to ear.  She points to 
           the far end of the room. 

           In back we see a figure resting on a bed surrounded by a 
           white curtain.

           Lucas approaches her. 

           All of the injured who can walk rush out of the room.

           Behind the curtain we find Maria.

           She looks awful, with tubes coming out of her nose and mouth. 

           The noise in the hall is so loud the windows are shaking.  
           Lucas embraces his mother.

                                 MARIE
                        Quick, we need to take her to the 
                        roof. 

           Lucas shakes his head.

                                 LUCAS
                        You go.  I’ll stay with her.

           They wait a few seconds.  Marie tries to say something, but 
           the ruckus gets so loud the windows are shaking.  Marie runs 
           out of the room, leaving Lucas with his mother. 

           Maria opens her eyes slightly and looks at Lucas.  She looks 
           frightened.  Lucas hugs her with all his might as he looks at 
           the window. 

           Slowly the windows stop shaking.  The ruckus dies down. 

                                 MARIA
                            (in a faint voice)
                        Lucas...
                            (pause)
                        See if you can find a mattress. 

           Lucas notices that almost all the beds in the room are empty 
           now. 

           Maria breathes with great difficulty.  Lucas moves his head 
           closer to her and whispers softly.
                                 LUCAS
                        They’re looking for us, Mom.  You 
                        just have to hold on a little 
                        longer.

           Maria doesn’t react.  She closes her eyes and goes back to 
           sleep.

           EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

           The sun rises over the mountains.

           EXT. EMERGENCY SHELTER - NIGHT

           Henry and Joakim walk outside a row of homes used to 
           improvise an emergency shelter and information center.  They 
           check a bulletin board full of names where photographs have 
           begun to appear. 

                                 JOAKIM
                        Nothing.  What next?

           Henry looks at a piece of paper in his hand.  He sees a list 
           of hospitals, temples and emergency shelters.  He runs his 
           finger down the list.

                                 HENRY
                        We should try to find a ride to 
                        Takua Pa Hospital.

           Henry looks up towards the road.  We see a cattle truck 
           filled with children drive by in the distance.  It’s also 
           carrying a few old people and others too injured to walk.  
           Henry and Joakim look at the truck.  They look concerned.  
           Henry spots the woman with orang-pink hair he asked to look 
           after his kids earlier, walking in the road. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                            (shouting)
                        Hey!!!  Where are my kids!

           The woman turns to Henry.

                                 WOMAN
                        They’re taking them away.  They 
                        wouldn’t let me go with them.  I’m 
                        sorry!

           Henry can’t hear very well.  There’s anger in his voice. 

                                 HENRY
                        Where?
           The woman shrugs her shoulders.

           INT. MINI-BUS - DAY

           A beat-up mini-bus drives through an area with trees to avoid 
           the devastation.  It’s an old vehicle without a back door.  
           We see a lot of children inside. 

           Thomas is sitting in an aisle seat, protecting his brother 
           with his body in case he falls. 

                                 SIMON
                        I need to pee.

           Helicopters pass overhead.  The children stand to look out 
           the windows.  Thomas makes Simon sit down without taking his 
           eye off the missing back door. 

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           The room is silent.  Lucas is sitting at his mother’s side, 
           stroking her hair. 

                                 MARIA
                            (barely able to speak)
                        Lucas, what color is my leg.

           He looks at his mother.  The wound has turned black.  Lucas 
           lies. 

                                 LUCAS
                        It’s red, Mom.

           She looks delirious. 

                                 MARIA
                        Is there any Coca-Cola left in the 
                        can?

           Lucas looks around.  He sees Manchester Girl far in the 
           corner of the room.

                                 LUCAS
                        I’ll go check.

           Lucas runs over to the nurse.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Please, my mom... Her wounds are 
                        looking really bad.

           Manchester Girl takes his hand and leads him to the corner.
                                 MANCHESTER GIRL
                        I know.  We’re taking your mom to 
                        surgery.  We’re going to try to 
                        save her. 

           Lucas tries to take it all in. 

                                 MANCHESTER GIRL (CONT’D)
                        We’ll do our best.

           Lucas looks at her.  You can tell he hasn’t slept all night.  
           He nods. 

           He returns to his mother’s bedside.  She’s gazing at the 
           ceiling lost.  She looks dead.  Lucas squeezes her hand. 

           The faint sound of helicopters can be heard from the room.

           The few injured who aren’t already awake open their eyes, 
           startled. 

           The windows begin to tremble from the noise. 

           Maria squeezes Lucas’ hand tightly.  He looks out the window 
           and sees a helicopter fly past. 

                                 LUCAS
                        It’s okay, they’re only 
                        helicopters.

           EXT. CLEARING OUTSIDE HOSPITAL - DAY

           We see a helicopter cross the clearing outside the hospital.  
           Henry’s pick-up enters the frame.  Henry argues with the 
           driver to stop.

                                 DRIVER
                        No more sick here since yesterday.  
                        No more!  Full!  We move on!

                                 HENRY
                            (gesturing)
                        Just five minutes!  Five!

           Henry gestures to Joakim, but he shakes his head.  Joakim 
           writes his wife and daughters’ names on a piece of paper and 
           hands it to Henry.

                                 JOAKIM
                        Don’t want to slow you down.  Check 
                        the boards for me, will you?

           Henry nods.
                                 HENRY
                        I’ll be right back. 

           Henry runs across the clearing and up the ramp towards the 
           hospital entrance, weaving through the people on the ramp.

           INT. MINI-BUS - DAY

           The mini-bus in which Thomas and Simon are riding stops 
           abruptly.  Thomas gets up to see better.  Cars, military 
           trucks and people on foot are blocking the road.  The driver 
           turns off the motor. 

                                 SIMON
                        I need to pee!  I need to pee right 
                        now!

           The children look outside, trying to see why they’ve stopped. 

           Simon gets up and jumps over Thomas, making the most of the 
           stop.

                                 THOMAS
                        What are you doing?

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS / FIRST FLOOR - DAY

           Henry runs through the corridors, checking each patient on 
           the floor, each window into a room, looking everywhere.

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           Lucas looks at his mother.  He remembers something and puts 
           his hand in his pocket.  He takes out the piece of paper with 
           his name on it, crumpled and blurry.  He thinks. 

           INT. MAIN ENTRANCE, HOSPITAL - DAY

           Henry is in the main entrance, standing before the bulletin 
           boards.  He’s holding a list of names Joakim gave him.

                                                              CUT TO:

           Lucas appears by the reception desk.

           He heads for the bulletin board.

           His father is gone. 
           EXT./INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           Henry looks into the large room through the window to the 
           corridor.  He tries to check every face, but things are too 
           chaotic for him to get a real look. 

           He enters the room and walks past each bed until he reaches 
           the corner where Maria is lying.  But he can’t see her 
           through the curtain.

           On the other side of the curtain we see Maria.  She sees 
           Henry’s silhouette outside the curtain.  She closes her eyes 
           a moment.  Henry’s shadow walks off. 

           EXT. PICK-UP 3 - DAY

           The driver of the pick-up is getting impatient.  There’s a 
           British couple sitting in the back, holding hands. 

                                 BRITISH TOURIST
                        Please, they told us our daughter 
                        could be in Surat Thani. We’ve 
                        already been to this hospital.

                                 JOAKIM
                        We’ve checked all the hospitals but 
                        this one.  Please.

                                 DRIVER
                        Two minutes!  No more!

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS - DAY

           Henry reaches street level and heads for the main entrance. 

           We see Lucas walking across a bridge on the first floor.  He 
           reaches the central artery of corridors.  A volunteer is 
           handing out bottles of water.  Lucas stops to wait in line.

           He reaches down for a bottle of water.  He turns and sees his 
           father’s bathing suit in the main entrance below the bridge.  
           He can only see him from the waist down. 

                                 LUCAS
                            (whispering)
                        Dad...

           Lucas takes off running in the direction of the main 
           entrance.
           INT. MAIN ENTRANCE, HOSPITAL - DAY

           Henry walks over to the bulletin board and pins a piece of 
           paper to it with two names:

           LUCAS BENNETT / MARIA BENNETT

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           Lucas runs desperately down the corridor where he saw his 
           father. 

           EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE, HOSPITAL - DAY

           Lucas rushes outside.  He stops and looks around, trying to 
           spot his father.  Not an easy task, with all the commotion 
           and cars pulling up.

           Lucas runs between the vehicles.

           EXT. MINI-BUS - DAY

           Simon is trying to urinate by a tree.  But the knot on his 
           bathing suit is so tight he can’t get it undone.  Finally he 
           pulls up the pantleg and improvises.

           The driver turns the motor back on.

           A woman shouts at them to get back on the bus. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Hurry up!  They’re going to leave 
                        us here!

           EXT. CLEARING OUTSIDE HOSPITAL - DAY

           Lucas is lost in the crowd.  He’s desperate and confused.

           INT./EXT. PICK-UP 3 - DAY

           Henry takes Joakim’s hand and hops in.

                                 HENRY
                        No luck.

           The driver starts the engine, sticks his head out the window 
           and shouts at the cars following behind, gesturing.  He grabs 
           the wheel and starts driving through the crowd.
           EXT. MINI-BUS - DAY

           Simon finishes urinating.  He obeys his brother and gets back 
           on the bus as the woman hurries him inside. 

                                 SIMON
                        I’m coming!

           Simon’s face lights up.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        There’s Lucas!

           Thomas looks around in disbelief.

                                 THOMAS
                        Where?

                                 SIMON
                        There!

           Thomas turns and looks where Simon’s pointing. 

           A group of men carrying medical supplies are in the way.  But 
           they quickly walk past. 

           There’s Lucas, lost and about to burst into tears.  We see 
           the disappointment growing in his face. 

                                 SIMON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Lucas!

           Lucas turn.  Simon and Thomas are standing there.

           Lucas can’t believe his eyes.  He doesn’t dare move, afraid 
           he might lose sight of them.  His brothers rush over to him 
           and the three melt into a silent embrace.

           The woman from the mini-bus appears in the distance and 
           shouts at them. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Get back on the bus, please!  Now!

           The brothers hug and kiss at the same time.  People around 
           them stop what they’re doing to observe them. 

           EXT. PICK-UP 3 - DAY

           The pick-up is stuck in the traffic jam of cars.  Henry is 
           lost in thought, sitting in back.  He shakes his head.
                                 HENRY
                        This makes no sense.

           Joakim looks at him.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        We could be moving in circles and 
                        never meet.  We’ve got to stay in 
                        one place.  And sooner or later...

           Joakim shakes his head.

                                 JOAKIM
                        I can’t stay here.  I want to check 
                        wherever they’re taking the kids.  
                        You should come too. 

           Henry thinks it over.  Then he looks outside. 

           Henry can’t believe his eyes. 

           EXT. CLEARING OUTSIDE HOSPITAL - DAY

           The boys can’t let go of each other.  They jump all over each 
           other. 

           Lucas looks up and sees his father.  Neither of them moves.  
           Suddenly Henry rushes to lucas and takes him in his arms.  
           They embrace.  

           Joakim watches the scene, teary-eyed, from the pick-up.  The 
           driver turns and shouts something in Thai.

                                 JOAKIM
                        Just go.  No need to wait.

           Lucas is still in his father’s arms.

                                 LUCAS
                        Mom is alive!  She’s in bad shape 
                        but she’s here!

                                 HENRY
                        Where? 

           Lucas takes his hand and leads him toward the hospital.  
           Henry turns, looks for Joakim.  The pick-up is gone. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS - DAY

           Henry and Thomas follow Lucas, who’s carrying Simon piggy-
           back through the corridor towards Maria’s pavilion.
                                 LUCAS
                        She’s very weak.  Sometimes she 
                        says weird stuff.  The nurse says 
                        they’re going to operate on her as 
                        soon as they can.  I think it’s 
                        serious.

                                 THOMAS
                        Where is she? 

           Lucas points toward the pavilion.

           Henry has trouble keeping up.  Lucas waits for him.

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           Lucas, Henry, Thomas and Simon walk over to the bed where 
           Maria is sleeping.  Manchester Girl is next to her giving 
           instruction to an orderly holding Maria’s file.  Lucas runs 
           over to the nurse. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Please.  Just a second.

           Manchester Girl signals for the orderly to wait and takes a 
           few steps back, giving them some intimacy.

           Lucas taps his mother’s shoulder softly.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Mom, look who’s here. 

           Maria opens her eyes and sees her entire family sitting 
           around her. 

           Henry face lights up. 

                                 MARIA
                        Am I dead?

           Simon giggles as Thomas and Lucas share a worried look.

           Henry leans his face closer to hers, touching foreheads for a 
           long time before kissing her on the cheek ever so softly.  
           She seems to regain just enough strength to whisper 
           something.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Now I can rest in peace.  Take care 
                        of the boys. 

           Henry shakes his head firmly.  A pair of orderlies approach 
           the bed, accompanied by Manchester Girl.
                                 HENRY
                        That’s not what I came here for. 

           Maria looks at him helplessly.

           Thomas comes over and gives her a kiss.  His eyes fill with 
           tears.  Henry takes Maria’s hand. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Maria, listen to me.  I know you’re 
                        tired.  I can’t even imagine what 
                        you’ve been through.  But we have 
                        to keep fighting.
                            (pause)
                        The sea just washed it all away.  
                        It took away everything we had.  
                        But now we’re here again, all five 
                        of us.  It seems impossible, but 
                        it’s true.  And if we made it this 
                        far, there must be a reason.  It 
                        can’t just finish like this.  This 
                        can’t be the end.  It has to be the 
                        beginning.

           Henry bursts into tears. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        We can’t give up now.

           Maria and Henry say a million things to each other in 
           silence. 

           Henry looks at Lucas.  He’s so upset he can’t even look at 
           his mother. 

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           Two orderlies push Maria on a gurney to the end of a long 
           corridor, where some other gurneys are waiting.  Henry and 
           the boys accompany them.  Maria squeezes her husband’s hand 
           in her own.  A nurse steps in front of him and signals that 
           access is prohibited beyond this point.

           The orderlies take Maria away and we see her disappear behind 
           two singing doors.  Lucas catches a glimpse of his mother one 
           last time through the doors as they swing before finally 
           stopping. 

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           Lucas is sitting at the foot of Maria’s bed.  Henry is 
           sitting with Thomas and Simon, curled up on each side. 
           Thomas looks at his father’s face, visibly shaken.  Henry 
           looks back at him.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re the bravest person I’ve ever 
                        met.  I’m proud of you.  Thank you, 
                        Thomas.

           Thomas looks proudly back at his father.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Maria waits her turn, lying on a gurney beside Simonne.  She 
           looks at her wristwatch.  The glass is cracked but the second 
           hand keeps going. 

           Maria looks on, spellbound as she watches the second hand 
           continue ticking.

           Simonne turns over and sees her.  She’s teary-eyed.

                                 SIMONNE
                            (in French) 
                        I have a family too.  I’ve been 
                        saving my strength because I want 
                        to see them one more time.  I know 
                        wishing for this will keep me 
                        alive.

           Simonne and Maria look at each other in silence.  Words are 
           unnecessary. 

           At that moment some nurses arrive and wheel Maria away.  
           Simonne remains behind, waiting in her gurney.

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           Maria’s shattered body rests on the operating table.  The 
           room has an immense window.  Maria looks at it, terrified. 

           She turns and looks away from the window.  A group of 
           surgeons are operating on another woman, whose face we cannot 
           see.  It could be Simonne.  Maria sees a spider scamper 
           across the floor. 

           The doctors remove her clothing and bandages and start 
           cleaning her. 

           Maria’s open shirt reveals laceration in her chest and 
           thorax.  Her back and mutilated thigh have turned a color 
           that can only mean trouble. 
           A nurse approaches to put a mask on her and administer an 
           anaesthetic.

                                 MARIA
                        Do you have to?

                                 NURSE
                        We don’t want you to feel any pain.

                                 MARIA
                        I’m afraid to go to sleep.

                                 NURSE
                            (smiling)
                        You’re in good hands.

           The nurse puts the mask on her.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Think of something nice.

           We zoom in on Maria’s eyes as she fights to stay awake. 

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           Simon and Thomas are in their father’s arms.  Lucas is 
           sitting across from them.  He looks worried.  Henry looks at 
           him. 

           INT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           From inside the swimming pool we see Lucas dive in.  Black 
           water covers the outside of the outside of the pool, 
           completely blocking the sunlight.  Lucas’ face fills with 
           terror.

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           The room is completely silent.  Henry huddles with Thomas and 
           Simon in the corner.  There is fear in Henry’s eyes. 

           EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           The brutal mass of water drags Henry towards a row of columns 
           holding a son in each arm. 

           Henry tries to protect his children from the columns but 
           inadvertently takes the blow himself. 

           The boys slip out of his arms.
           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           Simon scratches his arms nervously.

           EXT. SIMON’S TREE - DAY

           The sound of the current is deafening.  Simon grips the 
           branches of a tree, staring at hundreds of red ants as they 
           climb up his hands, themselves fleeing from the water.

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           Thomas hugs his father.

           EXT. TREETOP - DAY

           Thomas clings with all his might to a slippery treetop.  He 
           slips, digging his nails into the bark.  He looks down and 
           sees a body crash into the trees.

                                 THOMAS
                            (shouting)
                        Dad!

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           Thomas hugs his father.  Lucas gets up, so anxious he can 
           hardly breathe. 

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           Maria’s eyes close.  They suddenly open, fighting, uneasy.

                                 NURSE
                        Shhh. Think of something nice. 

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           We see Lucas’ face.  He’s very worried.  He and Henry glance 
           at each other.

           Lucas contemplates the door.  Maria’s silhouette is 
           practically outlined in blood and mud.

           Lucas climbs on the door and curls up.
           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           Maria, lying on the operating table, looks at the camera.  
           She closes her eyes.

           EXT. SWIMMING POOL AREA - DAY

           Lucas looks at his mother moments before the wave engulfs 
           him.  He knows he’ll never reach her in time. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           Maria’s helpless face.  The glass shower screen behind her 
           vibrates forcefully. 

           The wave turns Maria black for a brief instant before 
           engulfing her, pummelling her against the glass.

           Total darkness and silence.

           Then, gradually getting louder and louder, the roar of 
           rushing water becomes unbearable. 

           INT. CORRIDOR - DARKNESS

           Maria opens her eyes underwater, lying on her back on the 
           floor. 

           Almost pitch black.  Sounds are deafened and at the same time 
           amplified by the water. 

           Maria tries to get up but the pressure on her is tremendous 
           and she has great difficulty.  When she finally manages to 
           turn over the floor starts to crack.

           Random objects appear out of nowhere and strike Maria 
           violently.  The floor breaks open even more. 

           The pressure of the water continues to press Maria against 
           the ground, which cracks around her hands and other encrusted 
           objects.  Air escapes from her lungs. 

           We turn 90 degrees to find that Maria isn’t lying on the 
           floor, but being crushed against the wall. 

           A horrible sounding crack and the wall gives way, dragging 
           her body through walls and glass windows.

           Maria’s body is struck over and over again in the darkness, 
           twisting and turning wildly in the water along with random 
           objects like they’re in the spin cycle of a giant washing 
           machine. 
           Maria screams in pain.  She crashes into another wall of 
           cement and glass, which resists the pressure a few seconds 
           before shattering. 

           Shards of glass whistle by Maria’s ear.  Her body crashes 
           through a partition wall that shatters into pieces and is 
           dragged into tangled electricity cables.  Before Maria can 
           untangle herself, her body is slammed into a labyrinth of 
           branches that scratch her skin and prick her flesh.  Her head 
           is shaken from side to side until she passes out.  Maria 
           stops fighting.  We hear only the thunderous water pounding. 

           The air empties out of Maria’s lungs.

           She gives up.  She accepts that she is going to die. 

           Then she is grabbed by a current like an invisible hand that 
           pushes her up, closer and closer to the surface. 

           Maria reaches the surface and desperately gasps for air. 

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           Lucas is sleeping on Maria’s door.  Henry taps him lightly to 
           wake him up.

                                 HENRY
                        Mom is okay, Lucas.  We’re going 
                        home.

                                 LUCAS
                        I want to see her.

           INT./EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           Henry, Lucas, Thomas and Simon walk towards the surgery area.

                                 LUCAS
                        Bus is she completely okay?  What 
                        happens now?

                                 HENRY
                        I talked to the insurance company.  
                        They’re sending a plane to pick us 
                        up.

           They pass two nurses pushing a gurney carrying a body covered 
           with a sheet.  An arm is sticking out on the side.

           Lucas turns white.

           We see the cadaver wearing Simonne’s wristwatch.
           A few yards ahead we see the doors of the surgery area.  They 
           open.  A pair of orderlies bring out Maria.  Thomas and Simon 
           jump for joy as Henry smiles. 

           Maria looks at them, still half-asleep.

           The group walks alongside Maria toward the hospital entrance.  
           Lucas spots Manchester Girl, watching him from the door to 
           Maria’s room.

           INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY

           Lucas sprints over to her.  Tears fill her eyes.

                                 MANCHESTER GIRL
                        Have a safe journey home.  And good 
                        luck.

           She bows and puts her hands together.  Lucas does the same, 
           filled with emotion.

                                 LUCAS
                        Kob khun krup.

           Henry looks at Lucas.  He’s overwhelmed.  He squeezes his 
           shoulder affectionately.

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

           A group of nurses roll Maria’s gurney to a medical plane 
           waiting on the runway.

           At the airport a lot of things are happening at once.  
           Camping tents have been set up where numerous volunteers sit 
           waiting with lists and papers, other people wander around 
           aimlessly.  There are boards full of information, 
           photographs, flowers and personal items. 

           A couple of buses open their doors.  Dozens of Western 
           tourists exit the buses.  Many of them hug each other, others 
           console the ones crying.  There is hope and pain in their 
           faces. 

           Simon looks a the sticker on Lucas’ chest.

                                 SIMON
                        Why did you get a name tag?  I 
                        didn’t get one.

           Lucas looks at the sticker.  He pulls it off sadly without 
           answering. 
           A MAN IN A SUIT accompanied by TWO WOMEN IN WHITE ROBES 
           appears to greet them. 

                                 MAN IN SUIT
                        Mr. Bennett, I’m Oliver Tudpole.  
                        The insurance company sent me to 
                        take care of your family.

           INT. MEDICAL PLANE - DAY

           NURSES with Western features secure the stretcher on which 
           Maria is lying on a perfectly-equipped medical plane at the 
           disposal of the Bennett family.  Behind them we see Henry, 
           who steps on the plane still barefoot, followed by the rest 
           of his family.

           A nurse finishes securing several safety belts to fix Maria 
           to the gurney.  Henry walks over.

                                 MARIA
                        Where are we?

                                 HENRY
                        They’re taking us to Singapore.  
                        You’ll be fine there.

           Henry is holding her hand.  The nurse walks over. 

                                 NURSE
                        Please take your seat.  We’ll be 
                        taking off shortly.

           Henry nods and sits beside Lucas.  The boy looks at his 
           father expectantly, asking for permission to see his mother 
           with his eyes.  Henry smiles and gestures for him to go 
           ahead. 

           Lucas slowly approaches Maria.  She looks sad. 

                                 MARIA
                        How are you, Lucas?

                                 LUCAS
                        Here.  With you.

           Maria smiles softly and the two stay quiet. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Mom, when you weren’t with me I did 
                        like you said and I helped people.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        A man name Benstrom came along and 
                        I found his son in one of the beds 
                        at the hospital.  And you know 
                        what?

           Maria looks at him, intrigued.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        I saw Daniel outside the hospital.  
                        He had a big smile on his face.  
                        Somebody was holding him.  I think 
                        it was his father.

           A long silence.  Finally Maria smiles.  A smile filled with 
           sadness, but also satisfaction.  She’s proud of her son.

           EXT./INT. AIRPORT, AIRPLANE - DAY

           The engines speed up and the plane takes off.  Lucas feels 
           his body pressed against his seat.  Simon has a sad look on 
           his face, leaning his head on Thomas’ shoulder.  Thomas 
           appears lost in thought. 

           The sounds fade and we start to hear music.  It’s an 
           orchestrated version of the lullaby we heard the old Scottish 
           man singing earlier.  Sad but comforting.  Henry contemplates 
           his family, reunited and safe.  He opens the palm of his hand 
           and looks at the three names Joakim had written on a piece of 
           paper.  He starts to tremble.  Tears stream down his cheeks.  
           His shivering blends into the vibration of the airplane. 

           Maria turns and looks out the window.

           We see her face reflected on the glass with the sea behind.  
           We fly over miles and miles of devastated coastline, taking 
           in the dimension of the tragedy.  Then the plane veers and 
           the sea floods Maria’s face.

           For the first time, she does nothing to contain her tears, 
           surrendering to her pain. 

           EXT. SEA - DAY

           From high above the clouds we see the miniature outline of 
           the airplane flying over the sea, a humble and tiny faraway 
           dot crossing the immense ocean.
