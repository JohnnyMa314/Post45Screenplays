           EXT. GERMAN COUNTRYSIDE (DARK AGES) - DAY

           A ROLLING FIELD dotted with CROSSES...  

           We PUSH though...finding A LONE FIGURE clad in armor. 
           Haunted.  Mournful.  He kneels before TWO FRESH GRAVES.  

                                 KAULDER (V.O.)
                        Most thought rats bore the 
                        sickness, others God himself. 
                        But there were a select few who 
                        knew the REAL truth...
                             (beat)
                        It was them.

           A DISTANT HORSE approaches -- The man looking up:  Handsome.  
           Steel grey eyes.  This is KAULDER (27).  Captain of the BLACK 
           WATCH.

           Stepping from the horse, a grizzled monk, GROSETTE.  He 
           carries a scarred battle shield...Kaulder’s shield.

                                 GROSETTE
                             (in German, subtitled)
                        Captain Kaulder, his Excellency 
                        calls.  The plague’s spread further -- 
                        We’ve already assembled the full 
                        brigade...But they need their leader.

           A beat.  Kaulder stares, stricken.  

           Grosette watches as he pulls a CHILD’S VELVETEEN BIRD from 
           his pocket.  The warrior’s thick fingers caress the toy.  
           With renewed strength -- He rises, taking his shield as...

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           The PROW of a boat BURSTS through CHURNING WATER.  Kaulder 
           stands at the head, eyes searching the horizon.  In the 
           distance...an ICY LAND.

                                 KAULDER (V.O.)
                        They thought they could hide...but 
                        they couldn’t.  Not from us.  
                             (pointed)
                        Not from me.

           EXT. FJORD (NORWAY) - DAY

           Kaulder disembarks from the ship, one of a SMALL BATTALION OF 
           HUNTERS.  Badass.  Think Medieval Special Forces.  Dogsleds 
           are quickly loaded with EQUIPMENT.  
                                 KAULDER (V.O.)
                        Iron...Salt...Phosphorous light.  
                        The only weapons that could kill our 
                        enemy...

           EXT. SNOWSCAPE - DAY

           The brigade forces its way through a blinding snowstorm, ICE 
           CRYSTALS dangling from beards.  One Hunter brushes away a 
           patch of snow, revealing a CLUSTER OF PRIMORDIAL MUSHROOMS.

                                 KAULDER (V.O.)
                        The men obeyed my orders...but I was 
                        no longer the Captain they knew.  It 
                        wasn’t duty that drove me.  Or 
                        honor.  I longed for only one thing: 
                             (beat)
                        My own death.

           Kaulder studies the fleshy spores with cold eyes, seeing in 
           them a sign.

                                 KAULDER (CONT’D)
                             (subtitled)
                        We’re close.

           The men strap on specially designed armor, Kaulder pointedly 
           does not -- The brigade exchanging looks as he strides toward 
           the horizon.  

           EXT. FROZEN TUNDRA - DAY

           The brigade approaches an icy plain, everything shrouded in 
           FRIGID MIST, it finally parts revealing...

           A DISTANT STRUCTURE

           THOUSANDS OF BRANCHES entwined into an IMMENSE EARTHEN MOUND.  
           Organic.  Alive.  The wood seemingly grown through the 
           permafrost.  

                                 KAULDER
                             (subtitled)
                        A witch nest.

           EXT. THE NEST SHELL - DAY

           The SHARP SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING!  The hunters HACK 
           their way through nest limbs with BROAD IRON SWORDS and 
           SHIELDS, Grosette behind them, whispering...
                                 GROSETTE
                             (subtitled)
                        Remember your training, every man to 
                        every angle.  A witch knows no 
                        remorse, no hesitation, more beast 
                        than human...

           His lessons carry them forward, the brigade finally emerging 
           into...

           INT. NEST - SAME TIME

           A different environment completely.  Humid.  Warm.  SINGULAR 
           GRITS OF POLLEN float in the air, the men faced with the last 
           thing they’d expect --

           A DENSE FOREST

           Ice and snow melt from their armor as they move through the 
           strange trees, branches brushing like fingers -- Suddenly, 
           they stop...hearing something...A HISSING SOUND.  Eerie.  
           Otherworldly.

           One hunter listens, realizing, the trees...are whispering to 
           each other.

           This is new for the brigade, looks exchanged -- But Kaulder 
           PLUNGES on, driven by great purpose, emerging into an OPEN 
           CIRCLE...

           A WOODEN ‘MACHINE’

           THUMPS and CHURNS as if alive, COMPONENTS SNAPPING and 
           CLICKING, CONICAL SYMBOLS etched in the wood.  

           Kaulder steps forward, examining this marvel, a NEXUS OF 
           ROOTS AND VINES entwined through its central WOODEN BOX, 
           entrenching it to the earth.  This is the HEART.  SIGILS 
           etched on the two seperate pieces.

           Grosette steps beside Kaulder, makes the sign of the cross -- 
           The following all spoken in German, subtitled.

                                 GROSETTE
                        It is ‘Goetia’ -- A Plague Box.
                             (pointing to its heart)
                        It taps into the planet’s root 
                        system, from here they can spread 
                        disease to any corner of the world. 

           Kaulder stares at the box, stricken.
                                 KAULDER
                        This ‘thing’ is what killed my wife 
                        and daughter?

                                 MONK
                        And thousands more...the crafting 
                        skill to operate a Plague Box is 
                        incredible.
                             (beat)
                        It must be a Queen.

           Kaulder pulls his sword, about to drive it through the Plague 
           Box...but before he can...

           A GUTTURAL CRY SPLITS THE CHAMBER 

           He stops short, the brigade quickly emerging into the circle, 
           pulling weaponry:  CROSSBOWS, SWORDS, MAKESHIFT PISTOLS, 
           TORCHES that bloom with GREEN PHOSPHORUS LIGHT -- Their eyes 
           study the forest, ready for anything.

           Except what comes.

           SHAPES drop from the roof of the nest!

           WITCHES

           No broomsticks.  No pointy hats.  These things are a separate 
           SPECIES.  Akin to man but horribly different:  Limbs long and 
           ribbony...alabaster flesh...slithering claws.  CREEPY.

           WITH A BANSHEE SHRIEK...

           A WITCH unfolds from the grass, clawed nails CLICKING in a 
           strange pattern, unkitting a PATCH OF AIR between its fingers 
           as it fires off a ‘SPELL’.

           TRACK THE SPELL THROUGH THE AIR

           It SLAMS into one warrior.  CONCUSSIVE.  He CHOKES, suddenly 
           unable to breathe!  Water spilling from his nose and mouth.  
           He’s drowning on dry land!

           A WAR-PAINTED WITCH

           Launches a SPELL, CAMERA SLINGSHOTTING behind as it FLIES 
           across the nest --

           WHAP!  The spell FLATTENS a knight.  With a GROAN of metal, 
           he COLLAPSES!  His armor now IMPOSSIBLY HEAVY!  The witch 
           LEAPS atop him, CLAWING his breastplate, tearing flesh.

           Quick FLASHES of combat as...
           WHAP!  WHAP!  WHAP!  IRON ARROWS are LAUNCHED in a fusillade!  
           The war-painted witch goes down, dead, liquefying into a 
           BLACK SLICK!  Uncanny and unearthly.  

           PISTOLS of ROCKSALT are QUICKLY FIRED, the witches SHRIEK, 
           caught mid-leap, bodies now just an oily film as they SPLASH 
           the ground!

           FLAMING ARROW BOLTS target the nest, FIRE SPREADING through 
           the trees, everything bathed in hellfire.

           Where’s Kaulder in all this?

           In the boiling heart of combat, a WHIRLING, CHURNING force, 
           IRON SWORD splitting the air!  He SLASHES at the attacking 
           coven, a spell ROCKETING towards him, but at the last second --

           HE DIVES

           Without the encumbrance of armor, he moves nimbly, combat 
           sweeping him through the forest -- We see he fights 
           differently than the others!  A man with nothing to lose.

                                 KAULDER
                             (subtitled, to his men)
                        What’s the matter -- You want to 
                        live forever? -- Charge on!

           With a WAR CRY, he HURTLES forward in a suicide-run, a 
           WHIRLING MURDER MACHINE, each dead witch liquefying into an 
           oily mass at his feet.  

           Suddenly...he SPINS, a LONE FIGURE standing before him.  
           Kaulder FREEZES.  

           THE FIGURE

           She’s DIFFERENT than the rest -- Aquiline -- Skin 
           GLISTENING with a milky lysergic fluid.  A Witch Queen.

           Time slows to a crawl, flames spreading across the nest.  
           She studies Kaulder, intrigued, able to read his soul like 
           braille from a book.  

                                 QUEEN
                             (heard, not spoken)
                        ‘You’re different than the others 
                        ...you want to die.’

           Kaulder grips his temple, the Queen’s voice RINGING in his 
           mind -- A commingling of ancient inflections.  

                                 KAULDER
                        What abomination is this? 
                                 QUEEN
                             (heard, not spoken)
                        ‘I’ve taken from you...A wife.  A 
                        daughter...your sorrow...I can 
                        taste it.’  

           A FLASH OF IMAGES

           Kaulder, heartbroken, feverishly clutching the bodies of his 
           wife and child...behind him, a PLAGUE CART piled high with 
           corpses.

           BACK TO SCENE

           With SUDDEN FURY, Kaulder LAUNCHES, catching the Queen off 
           guard -- The two of them CRASH through the nest, locked in 
           STRUGGLE, fire RAGING all around!  

           THE QUEEN

           Clicks her talons, unleashing a SPELL -- The attack misses 
           Kaulder, a tree VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTING behind him, EXPLODING 
           INTO PARTICLES!  Epic.  Concussive.

           She CLAWS into him from behind, Kaulder PLUNGING through 
           PLUMES OF FIRE, FALLING to the nest floor on his back atop 
           her --

           He SCREAMS in pain from its feral attack...and then Kaulder 
           does something shocking:

           He THRUSTS his sword into his OWN CHEST!  The iron blade going 
           through his body, KNIFING straight into the Queen’s heart!

           The Queen SPUTTERS black blood -- Kaulder grimaces, managing 
           to pull the blade from his chest -- He turns and grins 
           savagely, welcoming onrushing death.

                                 KAULDER
                        Today...we BOTH die.

           The Queen holds on, stronger than the others, doing the last 
           thing we’d expect...She grins back.  A horrible rictus.

                                 QUEEN
                             (spoken now)
                        No.  Only me. 

           Her palm reaches up, CLUTCHING Kaulder’s chest, the skin 
           above his heart beginning to BLACKEN.  He WRITHES IN AGONY.

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Everyone you love will die before 
                        you.
           And with that final act, her lifeforce drains, body 
           deliquescing slowly into a muddy slick -- Dead.

           A HAND

           Grabs Kaulder, pulling him from the nest.

           It’s Grosette.  

           EXT. WITCH NEST - DAY

           Grosette drags Kaulder onto an icy bluff as the Nest 
           collapses, the last thing Kaulder seeing before he blacks out 
           an ASHEN PALM MARK now emblazoned across his heart.

                                 KAULDER (V.O.)
                        That day, the tide of battle turned 
                        ...our world was never the same.

           The VAST JIGSAW OF ICE and MOUNTAINS DISSOLVE to become...

           AN OCEAN

           Swells rising to meet a line of WOODEN SHIPS.

                                 KAULDER (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
                        Churches of the world united in a 
                        singular cause, seeking out the 
                        covens, subjecting them to our will 
                        ...pilfering their technologies for 
                        the better of man.

           Scrawled into the ships hulls we read:  NINA, PINTA, SANTA 
           MARIA...until we see a FINAL SHIP...unmarked...mysterious.

                                 KAULDER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        No one would ever know a fourth 
                        boat trailed Columbus’ ships with 
                        the sole purpose of a first strike 
                        on the New World.  Spain claimed 
                        the land...but the church claimed 
                        so much more:  A global policing of 
                        our unclean brethren. 

           The waves darken, becoming SWELLS OF TIME...we see INVENTORS 
           from DIFFERENT ERAS studying WITCHSCRIPT DOCUMENTS... 
           experimenting with MECHANICS and ALCHEMY...

                                 KAULDER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Galileo...Edison...Ford.  Geniuses. 
                        But also beneficiaries of an 
                        efficient and secret subjugation. 

           The CASCADE OF IMAGES harden into shapes, becoming...
           EXT. NEW YORK CITY (PRESENT DAY) - DAY

           The GLITTERING ROOFTOPS and GLEAMING SPIRES OF MODERN-DAY 
           MANHATTAN...

                                 KAULDER  (V.O.)
                        As for the witches, they scattered 
                        into the cracks of our world... 
                        breeding with humans, weakening the 
                        bloodline.  In order to subsist they 
                        formed a truce with the Church:  No 
                        crafting against humans.

           The CAMERA drops to the GRITTY STREETS, entering --

           MAGNOLIA BAKERY

           Bedlam and chaos.  A MOB OF CUSTOMERS rabidly fighting over a 
           SELECTION OF CUPCAKES -- A SVELTE WOMAN stands behind the 
           counter, bladed witchnails dispersing a GRANULATE POWDER into 
           the latest batch of batter.   

                                 KAULDER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        They live in secret.  They’re your 
                        mailman...your dry cleaner...your 
                        baker...tiny stabs of magick 
                        unfurling around us while we go 
                        about our day.  Unaware.  

           THE CAMERA PLUNGES through the city, streets and sidewalks 
           ZIPPING past -- We find LORRE.  A DAVID BLAINE-TYPE working 
           the shell-game, ball sliding between cups impossibly fast, 
           everything a BLUR. 

           A GORGEOUS CLUB KID watches in amazement.  She’s beautiful. 
           WILD STREAKS OF HENNA in her hair.

                                 CLUB KID
                             (loudly)
                        Nobody can beat this guy.

           A MALE TOURIST steps up, slaps a Fifty down.  Wants to 
           impress this stunning girl.

                                 TOURIST
                        I can.

           Lorre glides the ball between cups, a dizzying display -- 
           Tourist points to a cup, Lore lifts it up.  No ball.

                                 TOURIST (CONT’D)
                        Hey -- I know it was under that one!

           He’s right, it was.  Lorre gives him a seedy smile.
                                 LORRE
                        The lesson?  Don’t trust your eyes.

           Tourist looks around from the Club Kid...but she’s gone.   
           Lorre POCKETS the Fifty, already working the next sucker... 
           but he looks up to see --

           A GROUP OF HAITIAN THUGS 

           Watching from across the street, BAROQUE EMBLEMS spidered 
           across bladed fingernails -- Witchmarks.

           Unnerved, Lorre quickly packs up his gear, grabbing up a  
           LACQUERED WOODEN BOX.  He heads out, looks to see if he’s 
           being followed. 

           He is.

           EXT. ALLEYWAYS - DAY

           We’re mid-chase now.

           Sweating, Lorre DARTS through obscure alleyways, the Haitians 
           hot on his tail -- They move unnaturally fast...but Lorre’s 
           faster.  A master sleight of hand...

           HIS IMAGE TRIPLES

           Lorre #1 banking left, Lorre #2 banking right, both drawing 
           the Haitians attention.  At the same time, the real Lorre 
           ducks down a hidden stairway leading into

           A MAINTENANCE ROOM

           Decrepit and musty.  Filled with old boxes.  Lorre watches 
           from below as the Thugs storm past.  He’s safe...for now.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey...

           Lorre turns to find the Club Kid.  They know each other.  This 
           is CHLOE -- She’s exquisite, brewing with restless fire.

                                 CHLOE
                        How much did we make -- ?
                             (sees something’s wrong)
                        What is it?  

                                 LORRE
                        The Haitians.  Don’t worry, I lost 
                        ‘em...for now.  
                             (offering her the box)
                        I need you to hold onto this, hide 
                        it somewhere safe.
           Chloe hesitates, lacquered wood catching the light.

                                 CHLOE
                        What is it -- ?

                                 LORRE
                        A delivery I need to make.  Take it 
                        to your sister’s and wait for me... 
                        at least until I lose the 
                        Haitians...
                             (off Chloe’s reaction)
                        I’ll pay you.

                                 HATIAN LEADER (O.S.)
                        Pay her?  You can’t even pay us.  

           Chloe turns to see FIVE SHADOWS unspooling from an open window 
           into the room.  The Haitians -- The LEADER looks to her.

                                 HAITIAN LEADER
                        This is Lorre’s mess...you can go -- 
                        We just want what we’re owed.

           He grips an EERIE DOLL made of ragged claws, Chloe noticing 
           the doll’s strange resemblance to her friend -- Lorre flashes 
           a look to her, terrified.

                                 LORRE
                        Don’t go, Chlo.  Please.

           A TENSE BEAT -- Finally, Chloe shakes her head...and turns to 
           leave -- The Hatian Leader grins.  Wicked.  Cold.

                                 HATIAN LEADER
                        My kind of witch...cute -- But no 
                        heart.

           At this...Chloe stops, the words seemingly registering...but 
           all she does is snatch up Lorre’s Mystery Box, taking a last 
           look at Lorre. 

                                 CHLOE
                        I’m sorry.

           THE LEADER 

           JAMS an OVERSIZED NEEDLE into the chest of the doll -- Lorre 
           COLLAPSES, hands going to his own chest, liquefying before 
           Chloe’s horrified eyes!

           Shaken, Chloe backs into the door frame, quickly heading out.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. HARLEM (ESTABLISHING) - DAY

           Sunlight plays across a series of run-down tenements and 
           brownstones...

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A DELIVERY TRUCK pulls up before a market -- The DRIVER gets 
           out, busy talking into his cell phone.

                                 DRIVER
                             (into phone)
                        Can you believe it, seventh kid to 
                        go missing in two weeks?  They’re 
                        calling him the Pied Piper.  Sick, 
                        huh?

           He unloads a palette filled with cartons of milk, IMAGES OF 
           MISSING BOYS AND GIRLS emblazoned across the boxes -- As the 
           Driver continues into the market the CAMERA stays behind, now 
           finding...

           A LONE BOY (8)

           He stands on the sidewalk, TWILIGHT BACKPACK slung across his 
           shoulder, waiting for the bus -- Suddenly, something falls 
           near his foot.  He looks down.

           It’s a GUMMI BEAR.

           Another Gummi RATTLES off his shoulder, the Boy looking up, 
           seeing the tree above flush with Gummi Bears.  Excited, he 
           eagerly scoops up the candy, stuffing his backpack -- Not 
           noticing he’s now in the PRIVATE YARD OF A BROWNSTONE.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, little boy...those are 
                        my gummi’s. 

           The Boy turns to see a KINDLY OLD WOMAN (75) in the Brownstone 
           doorway.  She smiles.  Warm and inviting.

                                 WOMAN
                        You’re a special young boy, aren’t 
                        you?  I can tell.  You see things 
                        other children can’t.  I’ll tell you 
                        what, would you like to see what 
                        grows in the back garden...?

           She pulls out the LARGEST JAWBREAKER the Boy has ever seen.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Picked fresh just this morning... 
                        and there’s plenty more.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Whatever you can fit in your 
                        backpack is yours.  Would you like 
                        that?

           She opens the doorway, motioning for the Boy to come in.  A 
           MEASURED BEAT -- This is a city kid, he knows better...but one 
           look at the Gummi Trees and his resolve crumbles.

           The Boy heads inside, door closing shut behind him.

           ANGLE ON: THE YARD

           The candy-colored gummis now just common acorns.

           INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

           Bright and big.  Filled with the things nine year-olds dream 
           of, the Woman leading the Boy past ROBOTS and VIDEO GAMES.

                                 WOMAN
                        You’re welcome to come by and play 
                        anytime...Now, the garden’s just 
                        back there, don’t be shy about 
                        helping yourself...

           She motions toward a door, the Boy heading forward -- With 
           each step, the technicolor surroundings behind him CRUMBLE 
           into reality, the toys now nothing more than MOLDERED JUNK. 

           The Woman pulls something from a nearby bureau...she CREEPS 
           behind the Boy, slowly EDGING forward.  Finally, she raises 
           her hand, revealing --

           A WHITE HANDLED RITUAL KNIFE studded with SIGILS, curved like 
           a sickle.  We call it a Boline.  

           Her fingers coil around the Boline’s hilt, ready to do 
           something unspeakable...but, at the last second, a SOUND 
           makes the Woman turn -- 

           A FIGURE now stands framed in the front doorway.  

           KAULDER

           He hasn’t aged a day! -- But time’s ravaged him in other 
           ways.  Thousand yard stare.  Long coat fluttering in tatters.  
           Slob chic.  In his hand, a MODERN-DAY TECHNOLOGICAL MARVEL 
           HAND-CANNON.  The ‘PURIFIER.’

                                 KAULDER
                             (to the Boy)
                        Get out.
           The Boy doesn’t waste a second, running past Kaulder to 
           freedom.  Kaulder looks back to the Woman...STUBBLE now 
           poking through her flesh, TUFTS OF SPIKY HAIR lurching from 
           her skull...the witch manifesting her true form --  

           A FERAL-EYED YOUNG MAN (24)

           This is ELLIC.  A witch.  Sinewy muscles.  Piercings.

                                 KAULDER (CONT’D)
                        Hello, Ellic.

           He raises his gun and FIRES, an IRON-FRAGMENTED BULLET 
           blasting from the chamber -- Ellic DIVES behind the bureau, 
           moving SURPRISINGLY FAST.  His speed otherworldly.   

           Kaulder FIRES A SERIES OF ROUNDS into the bureau, BLASTING 
           FIST-SIZED HOLES, the sound ECHOING through the brownstone.  

           He steps forward, gun trained.  Slowly, he edges past the 
           bureau, gun leveled but --

           Ellic’s not there.

           The witch SPRINGS up from another spot entirely.  He lets the 
           ceremonial Boline FLY!  Kaulder nimbly dodges at the last 
           second, blade THUNKING into the wall.  Inches from his head.

           When he looks back, Ellic is gone.  A BACK DOOR leading 
           downstairs now open!

           INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

           Kaulder THUNDERS down the stairs, giving chase. 

           INT. BENEATH THE BROWNSTONE - DAY

           Kaulder BURSTS through a door, finding himself in a SERIES OF 
           UNDERGROUND CHAMBERS.  Lots of wooden doors, SKITTERY HIP-HOP 
           blaring from somewhere.

           A modern-day witch lair. 

           Kaulder tries the knob on the first door.  It’s locked.

           INT. CHAMBER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           WHAM!  The door BURSTS inward from Kaulder’s kick, the witch 
           hunter entering to find...

           A RITUAL SYMBOL

           Scrawled along the wall like a gang sign.  Kaulder stares, 
           he’s seen it before.  
                                 KAULDER
                        Belial...

           At his feet, a SACRIFICIAL PENTAGRAM...STRANGE WEEDS sprout 
           in clusters along the edges, some kind of ceremonial root.

           Hearing a sound -- he SPINS as -- WHAP!  A GARDENING SHEAR 
           SWIPES the air, cleanly slicing the weed next to Kaulder’s 
           head.  He twists to find...

           ELLIC

           Garden Shears SPINNING deftly in each hand!  Kaulder FIRES 
           three shots, the witch DEFLECTING each easily with his 
           blades.  A WHIRLING FAN.  He LUNGES!  Tackling Kaulder, Ellic 
           surprisingly strong.  

                                 ELLIC 
                        Our kind.  Pushed.  Hunted.  Second-
                        class citizens.  But no more. 

           A BLADE

           PINS Kaulder’s coat to the floor.  He’s trapped.  Ellic 
           looms, raising his other shear for the death blow.  At the 
           last second...

           KAULDER 

           Pulls a PHOSPHORUS-LIGHT WAND, SNAPS it on -- WHOOSH!  The 
           room EXPLODES with green light.  The witch SCREECHES, body 
           instantly liquefying into a pool of black.  

           Kaulder recovers.  Steps outside.

           EXT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 

           A LITTLE GIRL (9) now stands, face smeared with grime -- She 
           shakes, clutching a HELLO-KITTY doll.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Is the bad man gone?

           Kaulder looks to her, not a trace of emotion.  

                                 KAULDER
                        Where’s Belial?

           The girl looks to him, sniffles.  Not comprehending.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Belial?
           She seems so lost...so innocent.  A BEAT.  Kaulder crouches, 
           something in him momentarily softening...

           A QUICK FLASH OF IMAGES

           The VELVETEEN BIRD spreading its wings...a FIELD OF LONG 
           GRASS...a BLUE SKY.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Kaulder’s eyes go cold.

           Fast as anything, he pulls out an iron dagger, SLICES the 
           skin across his own arm, clearing his senses...

           ...When Kaulder looks back, the Little Girl’s gone, revealing 
           her true form --

           A SCRAGGLY MALE WITCH

           The doll in his hand is a BUTCHER KNIFE already VIOLENTLY 
           SLASHING towards Kaulder!

           The witch-hunter DODGES, gifted in all techniques of defense 
           and combat.  Scraggly looks to him.  Grins through yellowed 
           teeth.

                                 SCRAGGLY
                        You’ll never find Belial, witch 
                        hunter.

           He LUNGES, butcher blade gleaming -- Kaulder PIVOTS, deftly 
           flipping his dagger across his hand, letting it fly!  THUNK!  
           The blade HITS the witch square in the chest -- But nothing 
           happens.

           Scraggly pulls back his frayed jacket, revealing a THICK 
           STEEL-LINED VEST. 

           He LAUGHS creepily.  Kaulder’s response?  He pulls his gun, 
           FIRES one round.  BLAM!  The bullet SPARKS off the hilt of the 
           blade, HAMMERING it in a notch further through the protective 
           steel until -- 

           The witch’s body liquefies into a SLICK.  Dead.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

           The nicest part of the city -- Where big money comes to get 
           coddled, scrubbed and tucked in.

           A HOMELESS MAN
           Walks the sidewalk, a RAGGED TWINE hanging from his waist, 
           tied to it a series of COMMON EVERYDAY OBJECTS.  Totems.  We 
           don’t get a look at his face.

           Up ahead, a STOCKBROKER IN A PINSTRIPED-SUIT walks a powerful 
           Bullmastiff named RODERICK.  

                                 PINSTRIPES
                             (to the dog)
                        Don’t eat that!

           He brutally SMACKS the dog with its leather leash -- The 
           Homeless Man approaches, interrupting him.  He pets Roderick, 
           a TINY BELL jangling along the Bullmastiff’s collar.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Magnificent creature...The Mastiff.  
                        Once a regal breed.  Bred for 
                        greatness -- But look at him now... 
                        Tethered.  Broken.  Living off 
                        scraps.

           Pinstripes could give a shit, pulls a five from his wallet.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        Just...please...take it and go.

           Ignoring the handout, the Man rises, heading down the street 
           ...we see he grips something in his hand:  The dog’s tiny bell.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                             (in witchtongue)
                        Voltai niktomo nerendus.

           Behind him, the dog VEERS on his owner -- GROWLING, 
           surprisingly feral!  

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        Roderick?

           We don’t SEE what happens next, only hearing as: Roderick 
           ATTACKS his master with a SNARL!  

           The Homeless Man looks back with a grin...We see his face for 
           the first time -- He’s magnetic.  A striking mix of 
           ethnicities, a creature of the streets with a heart full of 
           anthrax.  This is BELIAL (30).

           The dog pads after Belial -- savage-eyed -- joining its new 
           master, both heading around the corner, moving past A LINE OF 
           YOUNG BOYS AND GIRLS waiting to enter...
           INT. TOY STORE - DAY

           Upscale.  Exclusive.  Everything handcrafted, no cookie-
           cutter Fisher-Price stuff here -- A GRAY BEARDED PROPRIETOR 
           works behind the counter, cheerfully helping the children 
           with their purchases.

                                 PROPRIETOR 
                        Don’t worry, there’s enough here 
                        for everyone...

           But now he looks up, seeing Belial standing before him.  The 
           man nods grimly, revealing a set of bladed witch nails. 

                                 PROPRIETOR (CONT’D)
                             (to the children)
                        Sorry...we’re closed.

           GROANS as the children disperse, the Proprietor rummaging 
           through a SAILOR’S CHEST filled with TOY CARS AND WOOD BLOCKS 
           ...finally finding what he’s looking for...

           A PLASTIC BUCKET OF CHALK

           He places it on the counter, each piece multicolored, made of 
           the finest limestone, sandstone and shale -- He picks one 
           out, hands it to Belial.

                                 BELIAL
                        You like wasting your magicks on 
                        children’s playthings?  You think 
                        this is our true calling?

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        I’ve seen your kind before...brash 
                        upstarts who think they’re 
                        Witchkind’s future -- Every last 
                        one met their end at the witch 
                        hunter’s wrath...you’ll be no 
                        different.

           At this, Belial’s eyes gleam...

                                 BELIAL
                        You’re forgetting one thing, old hag 
                        ...He’s never seen a witch like me.

           His fingers coils tightly around the piece of chalk...heading 
           out the door.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

           A carnival crush of humanity, everything awash in electric 
           lights.  CLUSTERS OF TOURISTS take photographs.  Glass and 
           steel structures all around.

           Kaulder moves through it.  Alienated.  Abandoned to the 
           lonely dance of things which don’t pass away.

           He stops in front of  

           A TINY SHOP 

           Quaint.  The window adorned with CRUCIFIXES and VIRGIN MARY 
           STATUES.  Everything weather-beaten.  Nobody would give this 
           place a second look...and that’s the idea.

           Kaulder steps inside.

           INT. RELIGIOUS SHOP - DAY

           Dusty.  Shelves filled with HOLY CARDS and JESUS REPLICAS.  
           An OVERWEIGHT MEXICAN WOMAN sits behind the register. 

           Kaulder heads through BEADED CURTAINS, entering --

           INT. RELIGIOUS SHOP (STORE ROOM) - CONTINUOUS

           Lots of SHIPPING BOXES, CLEANING SUPPLIES -- Kaulder stops 
           before a WOODEN DOOR.  

           A METAL PLATE slides from the wall, revealing a SCANNER, 
           L.E.D light playing across Kaulder’s face as a HERMETICALLY 
           SEALED DOOR opens with a HISS... 

           INT. PHOSPEROUS CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Kaulder steps into a STERILE-WHITE room, door SNAPPING shut 
           behind him.  He closes his eyes just as -- WHOOSH! -- A 
           BLINDING BURST OF GREEN PHOSPHOROUS LIGHT fills the chamber.  

           As fast as it appeared, ANOTHER DOOR HISSES open, revealing...

           A RICKETY ELEVATOR  

           Kaulder steps in.  Closes the grate.  Heads down.

           INT. LOWER HALLWAY - DAY

           Kaulder steps off the elevator and into a stone hallway, 
           obviously an OLDER, HIDDEN STRUCTURE lying beneath the city -- 
           Along the wall, TAPESTRIES, PAINTINGS, ANCIENT ARTIFACTS.

           Kaulder moves past it all, heading into...
           INT. ARMORY - NIGHT

           A WIDE RACK filled with weapons of all shapes and sizes:  
           guns, blades, grenades, explosives, throwing implements... 
           you name it, it’s here in some kind of modified design -- 
           Hand-smithed by Kaulder himself.

           He unburdens himself of his arsenal, stepping into...

           INT. WORKSPACE - NIGHT

           A YOUNG PRIEST pours through a PILE OF LEATHER TOMES -- This 
           is TRAVIS (20’s).  A live-wire of juvescent energy.  

           Kaulder peels off the last of his Kevlar, revealing FRESH 
           BRUISES.  Travis frowns, face lined with concern.

                                 TRAVIS
                        You’ve got to be careful, Kaulder. 
                        Just because you can’t die... 
                        doesn’t mean you can’t get hurt.

           Kaulder all but ignores him, going to a set of BRASS 
           INSTRUMENTS -- Travis used to it.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT’D)
                        Okay, let’s see...We left off in 

                             (reading to Kaulder)
                        “In the opinion of this Cardinal, 
                        the witch coven’s assassination 
                        attempt on President McKinley was 
                        prevented only by the tactful 
                        efforts of hunter Captain Kaulder.”
                             (looks to Kaulder)
                        What’d you use?  

                                 KAULDER
                        A salted metal container.  Rigged 
                        to impact explode.  

                                 TRAVIS
                             (impressed)
                        America’s first grenade...armed 
                        with a cooking spice.  Not bad.  

           Travis’ attention shifts to the project the witch hunter’s 
           working on:  A WALL OF GLASS JARS filled with POISONS, 
           POWDERS and MISSHAPEN THINGS -- The young priest picks up a 
           vial labeled Box Jellyfish Venom.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT’D)
                        When will you agree to stop this 
                        ridiculous quest?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TRAVIS (CONT’D)
                        Whole centuries wasted trying to find 
                        something that’ll help you die...Just 
                        so you can find a way back to your 
                        family...

           Kaulder doesn’t reply.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT’D)
                        Did you ever think there was a 
                        reason for what happened to you?  
                        Maybe it’s a part of His plan.  
                        Maybe you were chosen --

                                 KAULDER
                        I wasn’t ‘chosen’...
                             (beat)
                        I was cursed.

                                 TRAVIS
                        ‘Cursed’.  Let’s see.  You don’t 
                        grow old.  You don’t get sick.  
                        And you call that a curse?  You 
                        sailed point on the Mayflower.  
                        Fought the frontlines in Salem.  
                        How many people alive can say 
                        that?  You.  You’re the only one.  
                        You ever think about that?

           A beat. 

                                 KAULDER
                        Every day.

           He heads out, infinity echoed in his eyes. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ST. JOHN’S CATHEDRAL - DAY

           Pigeons roost in the cracks of the basilica masonry.

           INT. ST. JOHN’S CATHEDRAL - DAY

           Shafts of light reveal a LONE FIGURE kneeling before a LIT 
           CANDLE.  Kaulder.  An old man in florid robes appears behind 
           him.  This is CARDINAL DOLAN (76).  Kaulder’s ‘boss’...and 
           the closest thing he has to a friend..

                                 DOLAN
                        Travis tells me you’re troubled.

                                 KAULDER
                        Travis talks too much.
                                 DOLAN
                        When I was his age, was I any 
                        different around you?   

           A SUDDEN COUGH wracks his body -- He kneels delicately beside 
           his charge, sensing Kaulder’s loneliness.  His isolation.

                                 DOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Travis’ faith is unshakable.  He’ll 
                        make a fine replacement...we both 
                        know my time’s almost at hand -- 
                        Our faces may change but your 
                        service in our name does not.

           Kaulder stares.  

                                 KAULDER
                        The situation with Belial disturbs 
                        me, his movements...his abilities 
                        ...He’s mastered twelve crafting 
                        signatures when other witches merely 
                        have one -- 

                                 DOLAN
                        -- I’ve taken it up with the Council.  
                        They’re assisting in the matter.

                                 KAULDER
                             (with disdain)
                        The Witch Council.

                                 DOLAN
                        Would you have things different?  
                        Imagine our world without the 
                        benefits of the their knowledge:  No 
                        polio vaccine...the atom unsplit.  
                             (off Kaulder’s silence)
                        Look.  You did a fine job today.  
                        Take solace in that. 

           He rises with a struggle, rheumy eyes fixed on Kaulder.

                                 DOLAN (CONT’D)
                        At our age...every victory’s to be 
                        savored.

           He exits, Kaulder now alone.  The ragged warrior pulls out 
           the VELVETEEN BIRD from our opening.  It’s a tattered mess.  
           Stitched together, faded and worn.  He pulls the string.

           Its wings beat the empty air.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The oldest Museum in New York.  Gothic Columns.  Old world 
           charm.  

           BELIAL 

           Stands at the front steps, Bullmastiff at his side, watching 
           a LINE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN enter -- He strides down a SERVICE 
           ALLEY, heading unseen toward the back of the museum, the 
           edifice covered in DENSE GRAFFITI.

           It’s quiet here.  No one around.  Belial’s hand runs along 
           the wall, upon closer inspection the graffiti's a curious 
           make-up of strange symbols and sigils: WITCHSCRIPT.

           He pulls the CHALK PIECE, SCRAWLING the outline of a small 
           doorway on the wall...he pushes against it, the door opening 
           to reveal

           A STAIRWAY 

           Made of rotted roots and dirt.  The Bullmastiff GROWLS 
           warily.  Belial quiets it, motioning for the dog to stay.  

           Belial steps through, the door closing behind him as he 
           treads downward beneath the foundation of the building... 
           finally emerging into...

           INT. COUNCIL SANCTUM - CONTINUOUS

           A giant earthen structure.

           BIZARRE SYMBOLS and COMPLEX SEALS carved into the walls, 
           Middle Earth meets the Grimm Brothers -- He arrives at an 
           arched gateway composed of BLACK ROSARY, THORNS AND BONE.

           A WITCH SENTINEL 

           Awaits, the TOWERING FIGURE comprised of PAPERY SKIN and 
           MILKY-WHITE EYES...it holds up a GNARLED HAND.

                                 WITCH SENTINEL
                             (in Witchtounge)
                        No casssts allowed...

           A taloned finger removes Belial’s twine of totems, the 
           Sentinel whispering his hands in front of Belial, ‘scanning’ 
           him for any weapons.  

           He’s clean.  

           Only now is Belial granted passage by the Sentinel.
           INT. WITCH COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

           Lit torches cast everything in a flickering light, an IMMENSE 
           TREE rising through the center of a large wooden table, 
           gnarled limbs stretched wide. 

           FIVE ELDER MEN AND WOMEN 

           Sit at the table.  Amongst Manhattan’s elite, they’re the 
           classiest socialites, the most generous philanthropists.  

           But down here...They are the Witch Council:  A GRAY-HAIRED 
           WOMAN with a Pomeranian, a EUROPEAN BARON-TYPE, TWIN AFRIKAAN 
           ALBINO BROTHERS and an OVERWEIGHT GENTLEMEN sucking on a 
           HOBBIT PIPE.  

           Their leader sits amongst them, A DISTINGUISHED MALE WITCH 
           named GLAESER.  Head of the Untouchables, the Elders of 
           Witchkind.  How old is he?  Older than you can imagine.

           Belial looks to Glaeser, kneeling according to custom.

                                 BELIAL
                        With honor, I greet the Great 
                        Council...

                                 GLAESER
                        Belial.  We’ve been tasked by the 
                        Church to deal with your agitations 
                        ...in accordance with the truce 
                        your sentence should be execution.
                             (beat)
                        But your hand in brokering peace 
                        between the covens buys you 
                        deliberation.

                                 BELIAL
                        I appreciate the Council’s mercy 
                        ...but surely you must be tired of 
                        taking cues from the very 
                        institution that’s oppressed our 
                        kind for centuries?

           The Council shifts, uneasy -- Belial noticing the leaves of 
           the Great Tree TREMORING slightly.

                                 GLAESER
                        The truce was a means of saving 
                        Witchkind from extinction in darker 
                        times.  It’s served us well --

                                 BELIAL
                        -- It’s served you well.  The rest 
                        of us...We’re a beaten tribe.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BELIAL (CONT'D)
                        Barely scraping by. 
                             (stands)
                        What would you say if I could give 
                        us the ability to turn the tide?

           At this, the Council exchange looks -- BLACK BUDS opening and 
           closing excitedly along the tree.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Your conditioning says no...but the 
                        Great Tree betrays deeper feelings.  
                             (bows)
                        I’ll take the display as a 
                        temporary vote of confidence.  When 
                        I next come before you, it will be 
                        to herald a new dawn.

           And with that, he heads out -- We HOLD ON GLAESER watching 
           the young radical, touching an EBONY RING along his finger, 
           troubled...as we CUT TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON STREET BRIDGE - DAY

           A sprawling TENT CITY beneath the shadows of the bridge.  The 
           city’s homeless -- Belial navigates his way through the lost 
           and forgotten, blending in perfectly...

           INT. SHANTY - CONTINUOUS

           Belial enters his tent, making sure the entrance flap is 
           tightly secured -- He spreads a CIRCLE OF YELLOW SAND across 
           the floor, kneeling before a CONICAL SYMBOL.

                                 BELIAL
                             (in witchtongue)
                        Notos slatai therondo...

           The atmosphere darkens like a shroud, air thickening into 
           primordial tendrils around him...

           We are in the TRANSOM...the space between space -- A FACE is 
           summoned from the ether, eyes gleaming with a veiled madness.  
           Belial nods to the spectral figure.  This is MARBAS.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Marbas.  I’ve met with the Council 
                        and done as you instructed.

                                 MARBAS
                        Did they suspect you of anything?

                                 BELIAL
                        Everything...but that’s not my 
                        concern.  You promised me delivery.
                                 MARBAS
                        Unforeseen complications.  You’ll 
                        find the artifact in the possession 
                        of a helpless witch named Chloe.
                             (beat)
                        But why have you not done as YOU 
                        promised...why have you not 
                        released me from my prison?

                                 BELIAL
                        You have my word it’ll happen 
                        shortly...But only after I have the 
                        artifact in my possession. 

                                 MARBAS
                             (angered)
                        You dare make demands, I MADE you --

           Before he can continue, Belial’s hand LASHES forward, 
           breaking the circle of sand -- Immediately the transom with 
           Marbas is severed, sunlight flooding back into the shanty.

           Belial stares, a thin smile playing across his lips.

                                 BELIAL
                        Chloe.

           TENDRILS OF STEAM rise from his body, a byproduct of time in 
           the transom -- We hear a distant ROARING SOUND, growing 
           LOUDER as it BECOMES...

           INT. KAULDER’S SANCTUM - DAY

           The RUMBLE of a SUBWAY TRAIN.

           It’s dark.  We’re not sure where we are -- This is a hidden 
           place.

           Finally, a door opens, a WEDGE OF LIGHT illuminating a 
           shrouded space.  Hard to make anything out.  Kaulder steps 
           through, lights a candle.

           As he moves through the chamber we see DOZENS OF ANTIQUES, 
           any of these would fetch a fortune on the open market.  
           There’s a bed here, a table.  Not much else.  A place stuck 
           in another time.

           Finally, he stops, standing before -- 

           TWO LARGE PORTRAITS  

           16th Century.  Exquisite craftsmanship.  One shows a 
           BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, the other a LITTLE GIRL.
           Kaulder stares.  Taking in the silence.

           He pulls out a METAL FLASK and unscrews the top, raising it.  
           AN AMBER LIQUID spills out, a scant few drops landing on his 
           lips.  

           Kaulder eagerly licks them off...we hear a DISTANT SOUND ...a 
           CHILD LAUGHING...soft, melodious...Kaulder’s chest hitches, 
           experiencing a brief flash of precious relief.

           And then it’s over.  

           Kaulder stares at the now empty flask.  Lost.  Alone.

                                 KAULDER
                        In my time of need...strengthen me.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY (ESTABLISHING) - DUSK

           The New York skyline -- Sun falling behind the buildings.

           EXT. CITY BLOCK - DUSK

           Kaulder walks the street, pedestrians moving out of his way.  
           Wary of the strange man in the tattered coat -- He stops 
           before one of New York’s most iconic buildings...  

           INT. FLATIRON BUILDING - DUSK

           Kaulder enters the building, steps through an UNMARKED SERVICE 
           DOOR, it leads to an old CAGED ELEVATOR.  He takes it up.

           INT. FLATIRON BUILDING (TOP FLOOR) - DUSK

           Kaulder SLIDES open the grate, stepping out.  The hallway 
           filled with empty offices and a single window.  

           THROUGH THE WINDOW

           A SINGLE RAY OF SUNLIGHT SHINES, New York’s last of the day -- 
           It ALIGHTS on a SMALL GLASS GLOBE affixed to a WOODEN DOOR at 
           the end of the hall.

           Kaulder approaches the door.  Stands before it.  From inside 
           the glass globe, an IRIS opens, SNAPPING into place.

           The door swings open...
           INT. PARLOUR LAST LIGHT - SAME TIME

           Dark and murky.  Everything lit by hazy gaslight.  LOW TABLES 
           are flanked by CRUSHED VELVET PILLOWS, clutters of GLASS 
           GLOBES sitting atop.  

           The few PATRONS eye Kaulder.  Suspicious.  A RAVEN-HAIRED 
           HOSTESS leads Kaulder to a CIRCULAR BAR backlit by rows of 
           COLORED BOTTLES.

                                 HOSTESS
                        I’ll let Düer know you’re here.

           She seats Kaulder at the bar.  Walks off.  The place is 
           bustling with a bizarre kind of nightlife, otherworldly vice 
           and back door dealings. 

           The clientele?  A curious mix of the coolest hipsters and the 
           über wealthy -- An OLDER STOCKBROKER lies prostrate, GIGGLING 
           like a little girl...A SOHO PAINTER dances in the corner with 
           his eyes closed.  EAGER HOSTESSES refill their glasses.

           Finally, a RAVISHING WHITE WITCH with frosted hair emerges, 
           approaching Kaulder from behind the bar.  This is DÜER (34).

                                 KAULDER
                        So...Serving humans.  Again.

           Despite his demeanor, we can see they have an affinity for 
           each other -- She flashes him a smile.  Dark and flirty.

                                 DÜER
                        C’mon.  If you wanted to bust me, 
                        you would’ve years ago...but where 
                        would be the fun in that?  

           No other witch could get away with that...but Düer’s 
           different.  These two have history -- A SUDDEN GLINT makes 
           Kaulder turn, it comes from a girl alone in the corner, a 
           LONE DAGGER dancing nervously across her hand.  Chloe.  

                                 KAULDER
                        What’s she doing here?

                                 DÜER
                        Chloe?  Visiting her big sister for 
                        a few days, I’m teaching her the 
                        family trade.

                                 KAULDER
                        Does big sister know little 
                        sister’s ripping off Belladonna 
                        dealers in Washington Square?
                                 DÜER
                        Chloe has a gift for bad decisions 
                        ...but...what’s the phrase?  
                        ‘Privilege of youth’. 
                             (getting to business)
                        Now...We both know why you’re 
                        really here -- 

           She goes to a BOX kept on a special shelf, wood like sweet 
           polished chocolate.  She pulls out an ANTIQUE BOTTLE with a 
           faded label, swirling the DARK AMBER LIQUID within.

                                 DÜER (CONT’D)
                        Every memory’s distilled to its 
                        essence.  Add a crush of flowers, 
                        stir in leaves of wormwood.  What do 
                        you get?  Memories the color of rain-
                        water, hot inside the ribs like a 
                        firebrand...
                             (points to a client)
                        For her -- It’s vanity.  She comes 
                        to remember the way men looked at 
                        her when she still had her looks.
                             (points to another)
                        For him?  Innocence.  A chance to 
                        recapture the world through five-
                        year-old eyes, unsullied by cruel 
                        experience.
                             (looks to Kaulder)
                        But you?  You’re unique.

                                 KAULDER
                        Why’s that?

           Chloe finishes MUDDLING the elixir with WORMWOOD, placing a 
           curved glass before him.  

                                 DÜER
                        For you...it’s about pain. 

           She smiles sadly, pouring the concoction, the smell of 
           PEPPERMINT and CANDLE WAX wafting up.

                                 DÜER (CONT’D)
                        This one’s on the house.

           A BEAT -- Kaulder stares at the liquid, riveted like a junkie.  
           Finally, he picks up the glass, downing it in one gulp.  

           The effect is immediate.

           The air around him goes DARK at the edges, a muffled INSECT 
           HUM rising, Kaulder seemingly PLUNGED backward...but instead 
           of hitting the floor, he lands...
           IN A GRASSY MEADOW

           Tall and lush.  The MURMUR OF CICADAS all around.  He sits 
           up, hearing the sound of a LITTLE GIRL GIGGLING.  

                                 KAULDER
                        Elisabeth...

           He catches sight of a MOP OF CURLY HAIR bouncing through the 
           grass, coming towards him.  He ducks back down, reaching out 
           with his hand, grabbing up a NAKED FOOT.

           Kaulder pulls his daughter towards him.  

           ELISABETH (7) laughs with abandon, struggling playfully 
           against her father’s chest.

                                 ELISABETH
                        Daddy...you’re supposed to be 
                        hiding.

           She rests her head against him.  A lot of love here -- She 
           reaches into her pocket, pulling out SOMETHING WRAPPED IN 
           CLOTH.

                                 ELISABETH (CONT’D)
                        I made this for you...

           Kaulder opens the present, revealing the Velveteen Bird.

                                 ELISABETH (CONT’D)
                        It’ll keep you safe -- Promise to 
                        keep it with you?

           Kaulder stares at the toy, heart swelling.

                                 KAULDER
                        Always, honey. 

           In the distance:  A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN waves from a cottage 
           doorway.  Breathtakingly beautiful.  Kaulder’s wife.  
           ANGELIKA (30).  

           Kaulder grins widely, scooping Elisabeth over his shoulder, 
           heading for her...but suddenly -- He STUMBLES.  FALLING TO 
           HIS KNEES.  His daughter steps off, concerned.

                                 ELISABETH
                        Daddy?

           Kaulder lays back in the grass, stricken, staring up at the 
           sky.  His hand grasps out, trying to reach his daughter... 
           but she CRUMBLES at his touch, the entire meadow sweeping 
           into DUST as we CUT TO --
           EXT. PARLOUR LAST LIGHT - NIGHT

           Kaulder’s eyes FLASH open.  He tries to sit-up, can’t.  His 
           eyes bloodshot.  He looks like shit.

           Finally, he manages to stand.  Lurches.  

           Something catches his attention --

           CHLOE

           Steps out a door in the back, acting suspicious, talking with 
           a MALE WITCH clad in a BROCADE COAT.

                                 CHLOE
                        -- It has to be worth something, 
                        Worm.  Make me an offer.

           She stops, seeing Kaulder rapidly approaching.  Worm quickly 
           leaves, Chloe doing her best to gather herself.  She can tell 
           the witch hunter's hungover.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think my sister would be 
                        happy with you being back here.

           She tries to gently lead him away...but Kaulder’s not buying 
           it, heading for the door.  Chloe tries a different gambit, 
           talking fast --

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        -- She likes you, you know. 

           An obvious diversion -- But Chloe has a knack for it.  
           Kaulder stops, hesitating.  

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        I see how she looks at you...and I 
                        think you like her too.

                                 KAULDER
                        She’s a witch --

                                 CHLOE
                        -- And you’re a witch-hunter.  
                        ‘Romantic’...when you think about 
                        it.

           She stares, her contempt for Kaulder momentarily shining 
           through -- Kaulder’s had enough, looks back to the door.

                                 KAULDER
                        Enough stalling... 
           WHAM!  He SLAMS the door open with a SHARP KICK, heads 
           inside...

           INT. PARLOUR LAST LIGHT (BACK ROOM) -- NIGHT

           A room usually reserved for V.I.P.’s.  Draped fabrics and dark 
           furniture.  But right now, it’s empty...except for one thing -- 
           CHLOE’S MYSTERIOUS BOX sits on the table.  Beckoning.  

           Kaulder goes to it, flips open the lid, finding something he 
           hasn’t seen in over four hundred years -- the AGED WOOD, the 
           CONICAL SIGIL...

                                 KAULDER
                        The Plague Box.
                             (beat)
                        Impossible...

           Kaulder spins on Chloe with a renewed ferocity, full-on 
           Hunter mode, gripping her throat.  

                                 KAULDER (CONT’D)
                         -- Where’d you get this?

                                 CHLOE
                        A friend.  He was scared.  Asked me 
                        to keep it safe --

                                 KAULDER
                        What friend?

           Before Chloe can answer, something in the doorway catches 
           Kaulder’s attention.  It’s Düer.  Her face darkened.

                                 DÜER
                        You want to rough up a girl?  I’m 
                        right here.

           A BEAT -- Kaulder and Düer lock eyes...Chloe sees her chance, 
           she grabs the artifact, DARTING past her sister...Kaulder 
           doesn’t have time to explain.  He races after Chloe.

           INT. PARLOUR LAST LIGHT -- NIGHT

           Chloe makes it to the front door, barreling straight into -- 

           BELIAL

           Standing in the doorway.

                                 BELIAL
                        Leaving so soon, Chloe?  I wouldn’t 
                        recommend it.  
           He grabs Chloe, entering the bar along with his GENERALS:  
           DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES: SERBIAN, MEXICAN, TURKISH, ARMENIAN 
           AND ABORIGINAL.  Five in all.  Each subtly bedecked in the 
           dress and style of their mother culture.

           He shoves her forward, only now seeing Kaulder emerge from 
           the back with the Goetia -- A sense of inevitability, two 
           opposing forces finally crossing paths.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Witch hunter...

           Kaulder’s already going for his gun, but he’s slower than 
           usual, almost clumsy, he’s still in rough shape from the 
           memory drink -- Belial’s got the advantage, PINNING Kaulder 
           to the bar with a SAVAGE FURY.  

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        How many of my kind have you 
                        slaughtered?  The Crusades?  The 
                        Blight?  Salem?  

           CLIENTS and WORKERS race for the door, Belial PUMMELING 
           Kaulder with a series of BRUTAL KICKS -- Kaulder reels in pain 
           as the Generals converge around Chloe.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Do you know witch children tell 
                        your stories?  You’re our 
                        boogeyman.  Our monster...  

           With every word he offers another PUNCH, the witch’s wrath 
           palpable.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        I grew up hearing every single 
                        one...and I vowed to give your story 
                        my own ending. 

           Kaulder struggles but Belial’s too strong.  The witch’s hand 
           brushes his twine of totems -- He clicks his nails, the air 
           between his palm BLURRING, about to LAUNCH a spell...but at 
           the last second --

           A MEMORY BOTTLE

           SLAMS over his skull, Belial caught off guard.  Kaulder looks 
           up to see Düer!  She saved him.  

           KAULDER

           Drives his forehead into Belial’s chin.  Hand grabbing up his 
           gun -- Kaulder FIRES, PEPPERING the room, nailing Mexican and 
           Albanian witch, bodies SPLASHING as they hit the floor!
           BELIAL 

           Easily DODGES, rolling up on a dime to grab Düer, using her 
           as a shield!  Kaulder hesitates, if he fires he’ll kill her.  
           A BEAT -- Belial clutching Düer, whispering in her ear.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Let me show you how I deal with 
                        traitors. 

           He pulls a RITUAL DAGGER, slices it across Düer’s neck -- 
           Düer collapses, her body dissolving to an ebony slick as she 
           hits the ground!  Dead.

           Time SLOWS...Kaulder’s eyes flicking to Chloe...seeing the 
           horrified look in her eyes...and off her PAINFUL WAIL --

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!  Kaulder unleashes a BOOMING FUSILLADE, but 
           Belial’s too fast -- He LUNGES, Kaulder finding himself 
           FIGHTING a witch with the strength of a tiger, the battle 
           BRUTAL, spilling throughout the bar.

           THE THREE WITCHES

           Move in on Chloe, dark grins curling across their faces, time 
           RAMPING into SYRUPY SLOWNESS as...

           THE SERBIAN 

           Uncoils his hand, a mixture of gas and oil EMITTING from his 
           palm pores -- PLUMES OF LIQUID FIRE BLOSSOMING toward Chloe.

           CHLOE

           DIVES atop a table at the last second, helpless to watch as a 
           CARPET OF FIRE spreads across the floor.

           Oh wait...did I say helpless?

           My mistake.

           Like quicksilver, her hand FLASHES UP, revealing a SERIES OF 
           FIVE KNIVES between each finger -- THRACK!  She lets one FLY, 
           blade HISSING through the air!

           TRACK THE KNIFE

           WEAVING through the witches like a heatseeker, homing in on 
           the Serbian as it EMBEDS smack dab into his fire-casting palm. 

           OIL AND GAS 
           SPUTTER wildly as WHOOSH! -- The mixture DOUSES his arm, 
           flame FEVERISHLY SPREADING up his body, quickly consuming the 
           witch in his own fire until he’s nothing more than ashes.

           THE REMAINING TWO WITCHES...

           Spring into action, HURTLING toward Chloe.  Turkish spits an 
           IMPOSSIBLY LONG BLACK LINE of BETEL, SIZZLING as it hits the 
           floor, barely missing her.

           CHLOE

           Lets fly TWO KNIVES, spreading her hands, blades STREAKING 
           through the air -- As if on command, the knives SPLIT apart 
           at a ninety-degree angle, one going right, one going left.

           Both find their targets.

           Aboriginal and Turkish go down, blades embedded in their 
           necks -- Düer’s entire bar now SHROUDED IN FIRE as...

           KAULDER AND BELIAL

           BATTLE it out, two dark figures amongst swirls of orange 
           flame -- With a ROAR, Belial manages to GRAB UP the Witch 
           Hunter, SPIKING him into the shelves behind the bar with 
           LETHAL FORCE!

           THE MEMORY BOTTLES SHATTER

           Colored Glass SPLINTERING!  Countless memories now lost 
           forever in time as Kaulder lies on the ground, crumpled in 
           pain.

           KAULDER’S P.O.V.

           As he looks up...Woozy.  Barely conscious.  Flames all 
           around.  Through the fire, he sees one bottle CRACKED and 
           SHATTERED...HIS BOTTLE...

           Grasping, he reaches, the bottle just out of reach, dark 
           liquid dribbling to the floor.  He can almost touch it, but --

           A BOOT SLAMS across his chin!  It’s Belial.  He LOOMS over 
           Kaulder.  In his hand?  The Plague Box.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Tonight we’re going to finish what 
                        the Queen started --

           WHOOSH!  Sudden flames RISE UP around the witch, DRIVING him 
           back -- Rampaging fire enclosing around Kaulder, the witch 
           hunter too exhausted to get up, his body about to be consumed 
           ...but at the last second --  
           ARMS

           Reach around him.  Chloe!  She pulls him from the fire.

                                 CHLOE
                        Belial’s getting away.

           Kaulder LURCHES, stumbling from Chloe’s grip, both of them 
           making it out the doorway in time to see --

           INT. FLATIRON BUILDING (TOP FLOOR) - SAME TIME

           Belial as he CRASHES out the window, Kaulder and Chloe racing 
           to it...

           ANGLE OUT THE WINDOW

           As Belial hits the roof of the next building, rolling into a 
           cool crouch.  Looks back at Kaulder with a feral grin.

                                 BELIAL
                        I’d keep an eye on your girlfriend 
                        ...she’s a marked witch now.

           Kaulder’s about to go after him, but before he can -- 

           ABORIGINAL AND TURKISH WITCH

           YANK him back with a HORRID SHRIEK, Chloe’s blades still in 
           their necks!  Kaulder GRABS onto the daggers.  Twists!  The 
           witches writhing in pain.

           Chloe steps in front of them.  Eyes dark.

                                 CHLOE
                        This is for my sister.

           She KICKS, sending both witches FLYING backwards into the 
           CAGED ELEVATOR -- Her hand comes up with her one last blade.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        And...this is for her bar.

           She FLINGS the dagger, blade SLICING through the elevator 
           cable -- WHOOSH!  The cage PLUMMETS, CRASHING to the floor in 
           a pile of twisted metal!

           She goes to the window, joining Kaulder as he stares.  

           Belial’s gone.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. PARLOR LAST LIGHT - NIGHT

           The smoldering ruin of Düer’s bar.

           Kaulder SLAMS Chloe against a wall, walnut wood panel 
           simmering inches from her face -- She struggles, but 
           Kaulder’s grip is too strong.

                                 CHLOE
                        -- It was Lorre.  I worked witch-
                        cons with him.  Nothing big.  He 
                        went away for a week, came back 
                        with the box.  I had no idea he was 
                        involved with Belial.  It’s true, 
                        why would I lie?

           Kaulder can think of a hundred reasons.

                                 KAULDER
                        Where’s he now?

                                 CHLOE
                        Storage Room.  Eldridge and 
                        Division...the black stain on the 
                        floor. 

           A SOLEMN BEAT, finally Kaulder releases his grip -- Chloe 
           rummages through the debris, finds her sister’s ring, she 
           stares.  Mournful.  

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        Düer didn’t know anything about any 
                        of this, she was always trying to 
                        keep me out of trouble.
                             (gazes around)
                        Look how I pay her back.

           Her eyes start to mist -- But she refuses to cry in front of 
           the witch hunter, watching as Kaulder snaps the ‘Purifier’ up 
           from the floor, heading for the door.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        Where you going?

                                 KAULDER
                        To clean up your mess.

           Chloe stares, something new blooming inside her: Purpose

                                 CHLOE
                        I can help you.

           Kaulder shoves past her.
                                 KAULDER
                        This isn’t a game.  The plague 
                        takes everyone.  

           He strides for the door -- Chloe stops him, a jolting flash  
           of anger in her face.

                                 CHLOE
                        Belial marked me.  Every witch in 
                        the city’s gonna be after me by 
                        daybreak --  

                                 KAULDER
                             (holstering his gun)
                        Your problem.  

                                 CHLOE
                        She was my sister, asshole -- 

           Kaulder ignores her, heading out into...

           INT. FLATIRON LOBBY (STAIRS) - NIGHT

           He strides down the cavernous stairway leading to the first 
           floor -- Chloe chases after him.

                                 CHLOE
                        Wait!
                             (beat)
                        I can lead you to Belial.

           At this, Kaulder stops.

           Now she’s got his attention.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY - NIGHT

           A FULL MOON 

           Rises behind the Gothic structure...Belial clutching the 
           Goetia as he SCRAWLS chalk along the wall.  Tonight is his 
           appointment with destiny.  

           He heads inside. 

           INT. COUNCIL SANCTUM - NIGHT

           The Witch Sentinel’s clawed nails remove Belial’s totem 
           twine.  Studying the Goetia, its hand whispers across the 
           air, ‘reading’ Belial for weapons. 

           All clear.  The Sentinel nods, granting Belial passage.
           INT. WITCH COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

           The Council sit at the table, already engaged, the Female 
           Elder hunching over a SET OF BROWN LEAVES spread before her.  
           She studies their withered flesh, mysteries only she can read 
           -- The Council in mid-debate on the Belial situation.

                                 FEMALE ELDER
                        -- The Portends are dire if we 
                        align with Belial:  Chaos.  War.  
                        Death.

                                 GLAESER
                        Then we’re all in accord...the 
                        time to stop him has come.  

           He girds himself as Belial enters the chamber, stopping at 
           the opposite end of the long table -- As according custom, a 
           GOBLET OF NETTLE WINE awaits, Belial taking a ritual sip.

                                 BELIAL
                        I come not in war...but in 
                        solidarity.  I ask for your hand in 
                        bringing Witchkind back to its 
                        former glory.

           Glaeser’s face registers his disgust.

                                 GLAESER
                        You know nothing of our true past. 

                                 BELIAL
                        No...?

           He unwraps the oilskin, placing the Plague Box on the table.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        I come before you with a link to  
                        our history and the way to our 
                        future.
                             (beat)
                        The Goetia will live tonight.

           The Council stare at the artifact, Glaeser allowing himself a 
           tight smile.

                                 GLAESER
                        Your actions only show your limits.  
                        You do not possess the Goetia...you 
                        only possess a single piece.
           Belial stares, now that we get a good look at it...we see 
           Glaeser is right...it is, in fact, only one half of the heart 
           of the box -- Belial’s face distorts with anger, realizing 
           his mistake.

                                 BELIAL
                        I was misled.

                                 GLAESER
                        No...you’re merely a foolish witch 
                        dabbling in magicks beyond your 
                        understanding.

                                 BELIAL
                        And you’re betrayers of your own 
                        kind!  You’ve kept us in bondage 
                        long enough --

                                 GLAESER
                        -- Don’t go too far, Belial -- Even 
                        you can’t harm us in this chamber, 
                        the walls are lined with protective 
                        sigils...casting is impossible.

           Belial grins.

                                 BELIAL
                        Whoever said I need to cast?

           He BACKHANDS the cup of Nettle Wine, AMBER LIQUID splashing 
           across the entirety of the table...and from the folds of his 
           right palm he reveals --

           A SINGLE MATCH

           He STRIKES it with his nail, tossing it onto the table -- 
           WHOOSH -- The flame catches the wine, sending a RIPPLING WAVE 
           OF FIRE across the ancient wood, the Great Tree quickly 
           consumed!

           THE COUNCIL 

           BURST INTO FLAMES, their link to the ancient tree their only 
           weakness -- As the last of the tree is consumed, the Council’s 
           flesh petrifies into knobby bark, CHARRING and BLACKENING.

           BELIAL

           Watches, clutching the Goetia piece, flames reflected in his 
           eyes. 

           HOLD ON THE ELDERS
           As their forms lie immobile, bodies forever frozen in 
           horrible twisted shapes, open mouths now ROTTED KNOTS, 
           fingers GNARLED BRANCHES.

           The last line of Ancients is no more.

           Hearing a noise, Belial SPINS, to now see --

           THE SENTINEL

           Its pale, stark face stares.  Silent.  Ominous. 

           And then it does something surprising...

           The Sentinel bows before its new Master.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BRIGHTON BEACH - NIGHT

           Little Odessa.  Home to the Russian enclave.

           Kaulder and Chloe head down a derelict street, boarded up 
           stores and empty alleyways.

           Ahead, their destination:  A CRUMBLING STRUCTURE.  The kind 
           you’d walk past a hundred times without noticing -- The 
           distant sound of PULSING MUSIC.

           Kaulder heads for it.  Chloe stops him.

                                 CHLOE
                        Hey.  I have to go in alone.  The 
                        Russian coven own this place.  What 
                        do you think would happen if they 
                        saw your face in there -- 

                                 KAULDER
                        I’m not letting you go into 
                        Konstantin’s club by yourself.  

                                 CHLOE
                        Why not?

                                 KAULDER
                        I don’t trust you.

           A beat.  Chloe can’t blame him. 

                                 CHLOE
                        You think, Konstantin, the leader 
                        of the Russian coven’s going to be 
                        happy to see you? 
                             (thinks it over)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHLOE (CONT'D)
                        Okay, fine.  Play it your way -- 
                        But keep in mind one thing:  I’m 
                        not my sister.  To me, you’re not 
                        even a man.  You’re a murderer.  
                        Head down until I say so -- And no 
                        matter what you see in there, no 
                        hunting.  

           She turns up the collar on Kaulder’s coat, musses his hair a 
           bit.

                                 KAULDER
                        What’re you doing?

                                 CHLOE
                        Trying to make you look cool.

           She looks at him.  Frowns.  It’ll have to do. She takes his 
           hand, leading him down 

           A STAIRWELL

           To the lower depths -- She approaches a DOOR, speaking to a 
           BOUNCER out front.  A HAMMER AND SICKLE TATTOO spiders down 
           the side of his face, the hint of LOUD MUSIC creeping 
           through...impossible to hear what they’re talking about.

           While the Bouncer is distracted, Chloe opens the door wider, 
           Kaulder’s head down as she leads him through...

           INT. BANYA CLUB - NIGHT

           It’s dark, cavernous.  Hundreds of people in here.  The MUSIC 
           is ear-splitting.  Pulsing.  Lights flash.  The floors and 
           walls completely tiled, this place used to be a bathhouse.

           An empty pool is now a dancefloor -- Chloe steps into the 
           shallow end, talking to one of the DANCERS as Kaulder stands 
           at the lip.  Watching.

           Kaulder has to forcibly restrain himself from putting his 
           hand on the ‘Purifier’, TATTOOED RUSSIAN WITCHES moving 
           through the mostly human crowd around him.

           Across the pool, a stunning WITCH IN A STRAPLESS DRESS eyes 
           Kaulder.  Does she recognize him?  Maybe.

           Chloe comes back. 

                                 CHLOE
                        You’re drawing attention.  
                             (pulls him close)
                        They’re finding Konstantin for me.    
                        He hates Belial.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHLOE (CONT'D)
                        They had a falling out years ago.  
                        He talks about it when he 
                        drinks...and he drinks a lot. 

                                 KAULDER
                        So...we just stand here and wait?

           Chloe notices Strapless watching them.  Chloe moves against 
           Kaulder, pretending he’s her date, attempting to blend in.  
           The beat THROBS between them.  Relentless.  Pounding.  

                                 CHLOE
                        I hear stories about you...must be 
                        nice, not having to be afraid of 
                        dying. 

           She looks to see Strapless losing interest, walking away -- 
           Chloe keeps up the charade anyway, studying Kaulder’s face. 

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        So...what happens when you get 
                        stabbed?  Shot?  You just heal?  
                        You’re invincible...

                                 KAULDER
                        Nobody’s invincible.  I bleed like 
                        any man...I just can’t die.

           His eyes flick away, the music THROBBING louder, filling the 
           silence that follows.

           Chloe stares, struck.

                                 CHLOE
                        I bet you’ve had to say a lot of 
                        goodbyes.

           Kaulder forces himself to harden, Chloe catching a glimpse of 
           the sadness within.  The moment holds.  Intimate.  Fragile.  
           Beams of light SPLITTING around the two of them until -- 

           A HAND

           Lands on Chloe’s shoulder.  It’s her friend, laughing, 
           pulling Chloe away.  Not wanting to arouse suspicion, she 
           allows herself to be taken away.

           Kaulder is alone. 

           INT. BANYA CLUB (ICE ROOM) - NIGHT

           FEMALE WITCH BARTENDERS clad in fur coats of mink pour vodka 
           shots on a bar made of a GIANT BLOCK OF ICE -- Kaulder walks 
           through the crowd.  Tries to keep his face hidden.
           He catches A BEAUTIFUL FEMALE WITCH (Tattoos/Piercings) 
           leading TWO MEN through a doorway, Kaulder’s “spidey-sense” 
           going off.  He heads toward the door.

           UNSEEN BY HIM...

           Strapless watches from across the room. 

           INT. BANYA CLUB (STEAM ROOM) - NIGHT

           A vast space, shrouded in WHITE STEAM.  The music in here is 
           different.  Low.  Droning.  Somewhere lights STROBE.  
           Everything dreamlike.  

           Kaulder walks through the murk, seeing DISTANT SHAPES 
           shrouded in the steam.  He steps forward.  Finding --

           MEN

           Naked, lying in tiled tiers, staring at the lights -- A 
           DISTANT SMILE plays across all their faces, locked in some 
           kind of blissful trance.  

           SWEAT

           Drips from their bodies, pooling into a HIDDEN SLUICE lining 
           the floor...Kaulder follows it, tracing a SYMBOL in the 
           grooves...

           The sweat fills up a BASIN on the opposite side of the room --   
           Kaulder watching as the FEMALE WITCH dunks a shotglass 
           inside, drinking her victim’s precious bodily fluid like 
           Absolut.

           Before he knows it --

           STRAPLESS

           Emerges through the steam...but she’s not alone:  TWO MALE 
           WITCHES are with her -- They have Chloe.  EDGED WEAPONS 
           pressed against her neck.  Kaulder freezes.

           Strapless looks to one of the Male Witches, speaks with a 
           thick Russian accent.  

                                 STRAPLESS
                             (spits)
                        Take this piece of shit to 
                        Konstantin.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BANYA CLUB (TEA ROOM) - NIGHT

           Elegant and refined.  Air smoky with cigarettes and cigars.  
           MEMBERS OF THE RUSSIAN COVEN having a ‘damn good time.  Lots 
           of laughter.  Drinking.

           Kaulder and Chloe are brought in, drunken cheers all around.  
           Chloe looks to Kaulder, pissed.

                                 CHLOE
                        You were supposed to keep your head 
                        down.  I was handling it.

           A door opens to reveal a rock ’n roll looking Russian Witch, 
           Strapless draped over his arm.  This is KONSTANTIN.  Leader 
           of the Russian coven -- He looks to Chloe.  

                                 KONSTANTIN
                        Chloe.  You don’t return my calls.  
                        Refuse to see me.  Then I hear 
                        you’re at my club.  I think how 
                        nice -- But you don’t come alone. 
                             (beat)
                        You know how jealous I get.

           He SPINS, throwing a WICKED PUNCH into Kaulder’s stomach, the 
           witch hunter collapsing to the floor -- The rest of the coven 
           ROARS.  

                                 KONSTANTIN (CONT’D)
                             (wheels on Chloe)
                        What makes you think you can bring 
                        the witch-hunter into my club and 
                        get away with it -- ?!  

                                 CHLOE
                        It was stupid.  I know...but give 
                        me a chance to explain.  We need 
                        your help --

                                 KONSTANTIN
                        Does the mongoose help the snake?  
                        Does the sheep help the wolf?  No?  
                        Why would I help my sworn enemy? 

           WHAM!  He LAYS into Kaulder, knocking him on his ass -- 
           Again, the coven eats it up.

                                 CHLOE
                        As much as you hate Kaulder... you 
                        hate Belial more, no?

           At Belial’s name, Konstantin spits. 
                                 KONSTANTIN
                        Belial.  He a pig.  What does girl 
                        like you know about pigs?  

                                 CHLOE
                        I know the same thing everyone else 
                        knows.  He’s gaining power 
                        everyday, moving in on other 
                        covens, including yours.  He’s the 
                        new King Shit...has to make you 
                        nervous.

                                 KONSTANTIN
                        Nervous?  He’s nothing.  I made 
                        that witch-rat and he turns on me.

                                 CHLOE
                        Exactly.  So why not lead the witch-
                        hunter to him?  What’s the Chinese 
                        proverb?
                             (in his ear, seductive)
                        ’The enemy of my enemy is my 
                        friend’.

           Kaulder has to admit it.  She’s good -- Lots of MURMURED 
           VOICES, Konstantin motioning for silence.  A beat as he 
           considers, looks to Kaulder.

                                 KONSTANTIN
                        So.  You take care of Belial...or 
                        Belial take care of you?  I figure 
                        ...Either way, I win.

           He pours a shot of vodka, knocks it back. 

                                 KONSTANTIN (CONT’D)
                        We grew up together.  He was 
                        orphan.  A mutt.  But he impress 
                        me.  I take him in...we do 
                        everything together.
                             (beat)
                        But then everything change.

                                 CHLOE
                        How?

                                 KONSTANTIN
                        Belial met a man.  Someone who knows 
                        more about Witchkind than witches.  
                        He teach Belial things, ways of the 
                        Ancients.  Put funny ideas into his 
                        head.  Suddenly, Belial think he 
                        different.  Knows better than rest.  
                             (beat)

                                 KONSTANTIN (CONT'D)
                        This man very important to Belial.  
                        You find him.  You find Belial.

                                 CHLOE
                        Who is he?

                                 KONSTANTIN
                        I think witch-hunter must know who 
                        I talk about.

                                 KAULDER
                        Marbas.

           Konstantin nods -- Chloe surprised by this turn.  The Russian 
           looks to Kaulder, hand holding up a shotglass of vodka. 

                                 KONSTANTIN
                        So now that you know -- Join me.  
                        One drink. 

           Kaulder ignores the invitation, Konstantin visibly bristling 
           as the witch hunter rises to go. 

           STRAPLESS 

           Leans to Konstantin, whispering something in his ear -- The 
           Russian leader’s expression suddenly shifts -- Chloe turns to 
           go but -- WHAP! -- KONSTANTIN’S HAND AXE THUNKS into the floor 
           at her feet, stopping her.

                                 KONSTANTIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Kaulder)
                        You go.  But your friend?  She 
                        stays with me.

                                 CHLOE
                        That wasn’t part of the deal.

                                 KONSTANTIN
                        Let me tell you deal.  I just learn 
                        you have mark on your head.  A mark 
                        is money...and everyone know...I 
                        never turn down money.

           The coven pull SHARPENED BLADES, training them on Chloe.  This 
           is serious -- Konstantin grins, a predator playing with his 
           food.

                                 KONSTANTIN (CONT’D)
                        Of course, I could reconsider.  But 
                        only on one condition.

                                 CHLOE
                        What?
                                 KONSTANTIN
                        I challenge Kaulder.  If he win... 
                        you go free.  If I win...I get you.

           A long moment -- Chloe’s eyes tick to Kaulder.  

           He stands, framed in the doorway -- All he has to do is walk 
           right out.

           But he doesn’t. 

                                 KAULDER
                        What’s the challenge?  

           Off Konstantin’s devilish smile we CUT TO:

           EXT. TEA ROOM (MOMENTS LATER) - NIGHT

           A SMALL TABLE plopped between Konstantin and Kaulder, the 
           entirety of the coven gathered around -- Chloe standing next 
           to Kaulder.

                                 KONSTANTIN
                             (looks to Kaulder)
                        I wonder...have you ever had 
                        Mandrake...?

           Chloe’s face falls, Vladimir coming from behind the bar 
           holding a DARK BOTTLE with a FADED LABEL.  He places it on 
           the table, inside an AMBER MIXTURE. 

                                 KONSTANTIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s very rare breed of compound.  
                        My father spent years scouring the 
                        earth:  Deserts...mountain regions.  
                        Nothing.  
                             (beat)
                        But then he heard reports of a 
                        village.  Not dead...but not alive.  
                        Their minds gone.  Something got 
                        into the drinking supply.  Mandrake.  
                        He found the root, dug it up...and 
                        nurtured his own stock.  Why?
                             (louder)
                        Because it tastes so damn’ good!

           The coven laughs uproariously -- Konstantin uncorks the 
           bottle, pouring the dark liquid into a shotglass before each 
           of them.  

                                 KONSTANTIN (CONT’D)
                        Every year, on my father’s 
                        birthday, I drink one glass to 
                        honor him.  Guess what tonight is?
                                 (MORE)
                                 KONSTANTIN (CONT’D)
                             (beat)
                        Only one problem.  Any other witch 
                        who drink with me ends up a 
                        vegetable.  Mad with visions.  I 
                        think maybe I drink with the wrong 
                        type.  Instead of a witch...maybe 
                        this year I drink with witch-hunter.

           He holds the shot up, admiring the way it catches the light.  
           Then he downs it, smacks his lips. 

                                 KONSTANTIN (CONT’D)
                        Keep up with me.  Chloe goes free.

           A long moment, tension gathering amongst the coven...finally 
           Kaulder picks up the shot before him, FLECKS OF TAPROOT 
           floating in the mixture.  

           He eyes Konstantin.

                                 KAULDER
                        I knew your father.
                             (beat)
                        He was an asshole.

           And with that, he downs the shot.  For just a moment, he 
           wavers -- his WIFE appearing within the coven for just an 
           instant -- But then regains himself.  Places the shot down.

                                 KAULDER (CONT’D)
                        Your turn.

           Konstantin’s impressed.  Vladimir pours another round as the 
           coven MURMURS -- Eyes locked on Kaulder, Konstantin downs his 
           next shot.

           Chloe’s growing increasingly wary.  She leans down.

                                 CHLOE
                             (whispering to Kaulder)
                        You don’t have to do this, my 
                        sister taught me Mandrake.  It’s 
                        evil shit -- 

           Konstantin silences her with a wave.  He sees the way she 
           looks at Kaulder.  Doesn’t like it.  A long moment.  The room 
           goes quiet...Closing his eyes, Kaulder raises the shot to his 
           lips.  Swallows it down.  

           And when he lowers his glass?  His eyes open to see...

           INT. KAULDER COTTAGE - DAY

           It’s 1648.
           Kaulder’s now sitting at a wooden table, a plate before him.  
           Freshly cooked meat and fruit.  He looks around:  A cozy fire 
           burns in a stone hearth, his armor and sword hung along the 
           wall in the corner.

           He’s home.  

           The front door opens.  Kaulder spins, a wedge of golden light 
           spilling through the doorway as --

           ANGELIKA

           Enters.  Eyes sparkling.  Full of joyous life.  

                                 ANGELIKA
                        You cur -- The brigade came back 
                        early and you didn’t find me?  

           She rushes to Kaulder, embraces him -- A long moment.  
           Kaulder staring.  He smooths his wife’s hair, warmth 
           radiating between them.

                                 KAULDER
                        I’ve missed you.

                                 ANGELIKA
                        And, I you.

           He scoops her up, Angelika laughing blissfully.  He takes her 
           toward the bed...and as they both FLOP down they’re now...

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           Lying on a rock next to a BURBLING STREAM.  He stares into 
           her eyes.  It’s a beautiful day.  Kaulder's horse is nearby.

                                 ANGELIKA
                        What are you thinking?

           Kaulder doesn’t answer, Angelika sensing his mood.

                                 ANGELIKA (CONT’D)
                        You’ve heard from the Church.  The 
                        Brigade’s leaving again, isn’t it? 

                                 KAULDER
                             (nods)
                        The Taurus mountains.  Grosette 
                        hears rumors of a roving tribe of 
                        Hussites.  There’s stories, nobody’s 
                        seen a people such as this. 
                                 ANGELIKA
                        Grosette.  I don’t trust that monk -- 
                        He’s always taking you away from me. 

           A SUDDEN SPLASH OF COLD WATER interrupts their conversation.  
           Kaulder looks up: Elisabeth stands in the middle of the 
           brook.  Big smile on her face.

                                 ELISABETH
                        I snuck up on daddy, the great 
                        Captain!

           Kaulder splashes through the water after his daughter. 
           Angelika watches, cheering Elisabeth on as Kaulder playfully 
           grabs her up, PLUNGING them both underwater...but when 
           Kaulder BREAKS THE SURFACE he’s now...

           EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

           Walking through a MARKETPLACE with Angelika.  It’s bustling.  
           Filled with life.  Angelika looks to him, BELLY SWOLLEN WITH 
           CHILD.  

                                 ANGELIKA
                        She’ll be beautiful.

                                 KAULDER
                        Ah, so she’s a girl?  You know this 
                        for sure?

                                 ANGELIKA
                        Of course, it’s a girl.  She’ll 
                        have her mother’s fire.  And her 
                        father’s stubbornness...

           Kaulder notices a FIGURE walking through the crowd, following 
           them...It’s Chloe...he doesn’t seem to recognize her as she 
           steps in Kaulder’s way, confronting him.

                                 CHLOE
                        Listen to me.  You need to wake up.

           Angelika turns to him, confused.

                                 ANGELIKA
                        You know this girl?

           Kaulder stirs, as if trying to remember a strange dream.

                                 KAULDER
                        I’m not sure...
                                 CHLOE
                        Listen.  You’re caught in a dream 
                        trap.  You need to wake up.  
                        Konstantin tricked you.  He’s built 
                        up a tolerance to Mandrake.  

           Kaulder looks at her, starting to remember.

                                 KAULDER
                        What if I want to stay here?

                                 CHLOE
                        You can’t -- If you do, you’ll be 
                        here forever.  Tumbling through 
                        moments of your past.

                                 KAULDER
                        ...And what’s wrong with that?

                                 CHLOE
                        None of this is real.  They’re just 
                        memories.

           Kaulder looks at Angelika, the marketplace.  The smells.  The 
           sounds.  It feels real.  In fact, it feels perfect.

                                 KAULDER
                        I’m staying.

           Fast as a flash, Chloe PLUCKS a knife from the market stall, 
           LUNGES at the Kaulder -- Kaulder’s faster.  He grabs her arm, 
           the two of them TUMBLING over a table.  Grappling.  

                                 CHLOE
                        I cut you with this knife, the 
                        shock will bring you back.

           Kaulder FLINGS her off, Chloe springing back up, our two 
           heroes going at it in a no-holds barred fight SPILLING not 
           only through the marketplace but through Kaulder’s 
           memories...

           He SLAMS her against a wall, now back at the cottage...

           She fights back, both of them rolling across the stone floor, 
           SPLASHING into the brook...It continues on like this...both 
           gifted at combat, neither able to get the upper hand.  

           Until, they’re back at the marketplace.  

           And this time, Chloe has a plan.  
           She snatches up Angelika, POINTING the edge of the knife into 
           her neck.  Draws a pinprick of blood -- Angelika looks to her 
           husband, scared.

                                 ANGELIKA
                        Andreas?

           Kaulder freezes, time slowing to a heartbeat -- Chloe keeps 
           the blade poised.

                                 CHLOE
                        Time to wake up.

           She lifts the blade as if to use it against Angelika...but at 
           the last second, she FLINGS it at Kaulder, the knife BURYING 
           in Kaulder’s chest!  He GASPS, overcome -- And as he PLUNGES 
           to his knees --

           INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

           Kaulder’s eyes FLASH open.  He’s back with Konstantin.  He 
           recovers fast -- SMASHES the Mandrake Bottle, FLINGING aside 
           the table, pressing JAGGED GLASS to Konstantin’s neck.  

           Despite himself, the Russian’s impressed.

                                 KONSTANTIN
                        A man who can hold his drink.
                             (grins)
                        I like that.

           The rest of the coven edge forward, weapons drawn -- But 
           Chloe blocks Kaulder, a HOST OF KNIVES fanned between each 
           finger.  

           Konstantin holds up his hand.

                                 KONSTANTIN (CONT’D)
                        Enough!
                             (looks to Kaulder)
                        You go find Belial.  Use one of 
                        your iron bullets to tell him I say 
                        hello. 

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE CLUB - NIGHT

           Kaulder and Chloe head out the door, the smoke and stink of 
           the club still on their bodies.  Chloe looks to him.

                                 CHLOE
                        Hey.
                             (not easily said)
                        Thanks for what you did up there.
           She means it...but Kaulder ignores her, keeps on walking.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        So...you know this ‘Marbas’?
                        You know where to find him?

           No reply, Kaulder staring ahead.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell’s WRONG with you --

           Kaulder turns, SLAMS her up against the wall.  His voice 
           sharp as a razor. 

                                 KAULDER
                        My memories are my own.  Stay out 
                        of my head.

                                 CHLOE
                        I’m sorry.  It was a trick my 
                        sister taught me.  Memories... 
                        they’re more permeable than 
                        everyone thinks.

           Kaulder stares -- Like it or not, the dynamic between them’s 
           altered now, she’s seen his secret self.

           He lets her go, more calm.  When he speaks, his voice just 
           above a whisper.

                                 KAULDER
                        They’re all I have left. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Okay.  But I have to tell you 
                        something...
                             (beat)
                        I saw the way you looked at your 
                        daughter.  You loved her.  I never 
                        had that.  Our parents left when 
                        Düer and I were little.
                             (beat)
                        It was nice to be in it with you.  
                        Even if it was just a memory.

           A beat.  Silence stretching between them, two lonely figures 
           on an empty street.

                                 KAULDER
                        If I’m going to get to Marbas, I 
                        need your help.
           The witch hunter needs help?  Instead of reassuring Chloe, 
           this confession makes her nervous.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WITCH COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

           FOUR FIGURES enter the chamber.  Muscular.  Iron gazes.  
           Leaders of the oldest covens in the city:  Asian, Brazilian, 
           Hispanic and Afrikaan.  All clad in clothes of their culture.

                                 BELIAL (O.S.)
                        The wheel turns, my brothers...

           They look to see Belial standing amongst the petrified bodies 
           of the Council, the Mastiff at his feet, teeth gnawing 
           sharply on the gnarled wood of Glaeser’s leg.

                                 ASIAN LEADER
                        So it’s true...the Council is no 
                        more.

                                 BELIAL
                        The Council protected their own 
                        interests.  “There’s no slavery but 
                        ignorance.” 
                             (beat)
                        I ask for your solidarity.

           He pulls out a ritual blade called an ATHAME, placing his 
           hand on the scorched remains of the Great Tree.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Man’s greatest accomplishments are 
                        OUR accomplishments.  Vaccines.  
                        Medicines.  We gave them nature’s 
                        secrets.  The power to harness the 
                        sun.  What do they give us?  Rules!  
                             (gazing to each)
                        We were keepers of dark woods, gods 
                        of African veldts, ghosts of black 
                        mountains.  We can be again.

                                 AFRIKAAN LEADER
                        What about Konstantin -- Why’s the 
                        Russian contingent not present?

                                 BELIAL
                        I’m afraid Konstantin is a lost 
                        cause.

           A BEAT -- The Leaders exchange looks -- finally the Afrikaan 
           places his hand atop Belial’s...soon joined by the others, 
           the five coven leaders pledging their allegiance.
                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Our names will be inscribed beside 
                        Aethal in the pages of witch history 
                        forever.

           And with that, he PLUNGES the Athame through their hands, the 
           blade BURYING in the skin of the Great Tree!  Blood FLOWERS 
           from their wounds, the dry bark drinking up the fluid.

           Belial pulls the knife back out, the Leaders watching as --

           BLACK BUDS

           Blossom across the dead branches, the Great Tree blooming 
           back to life -- And for the first time in over a century...a 
           new Witch Council is born.

           The Bullmastiff growls, guttural and low.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           The slums of Little Ethiopia.

           Kaulder and Chloe stand in the shadows of an alleyway, 
           looking at SOMETHING UNSEEN across the street.

                                 CHLOE
                        We find Marbas...here?

           Reveal:  An imposing stone building, almost medieval, slats 
           for windows.  The only touch of modernity the myriad 
           SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS -- A building designed to keep those 
           inside from ever getting out.  

           A METAL SIGN reads:  BATTERY PRISON 

                                 KAULDER
                        Marbas was the only human I ever 
                        hunted.  He learned the truth about 
                        witches.  It drove him insane, he 
                        wasted his family’s fortune buying 
                        every scrap of witch lore the 
                        Church didn’t have their hands on.

                                 CHLOE
                        Why?

                                 KAULDER
                        He wanted to become a witch. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KAULDER (CONT'D)
                        He sacrificed five women, thinking 
                        it would do the trick...but it only 
                        made him a serial killer.  Just 
                        before I caught him, Marbas burned 
                        his whole collection...so the 
                        Church wouldn’t get it.  He’s 
                        dangerous.  Knows more about 
                        crafting than most witches.   

                                 CHLOE
                        I’ve heard of him, what’s he want 
                        with Belial?

           Kaulder doesn’t answer, pulling out a WIRELESS EARPIECE, 
           jamming it in his ear.

                                 KAULDER
                             (into earpiece)
                        Travis, you ready?

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME

           Travis sits before a bank of monitors, disappointed -- ON 
           SCREEN:  Battery Asylum.  He’s hooked into their camera feed.

                                 TRAVIS
                             (into microphone)
                        Yeah, but you do know you’re 
                        supposed to break OUT of prison, 
                        not into it -- 
                             (looking at camera, 
                              surprised)
                        Wait.  Who’s the girl!? 

                                 KAULDER (O.S.)
                        Not now...

           EXT. BATTERY PRISON - SAME TIME

           Kaulder and Chloe move toward the prison entrance.

                                 TRAVIS (O.S.)
                        All cameras on the west face are 
                        under my control.  You’re ghosts.

           Using the PASSING TRAFFIC as coverage from a watchful ARMED 
           PEDESTRIAN GUARD, our heroes move from car to car, staying 
           out of his eyeline.

           Finally, they make their way to the front door, heading 
           inside...
           INT. BATTERY PRISON (FRONT LOBBY) - SAME TIME

           FOUR GUARDS sit behind a WALL OF GLASS.  A YANKEES GAME plays 
           on a nearby television -- One guard approaches, surprised he 
           didn’t notice anyone on the surveillance monitor.

                                 GUARD #1
                        Visiting hours are one to four.

           Chloe ignores him, studying the bulletproof glass wall.

                                 CHLOE
                        Lead-lined.

                                 KAULDER
                        ...Do it.

           Chloe touches her fingers to the glass, lead metal inside 
           liquefying into GREY GLOBULES, SPREADING in shifting 
           RORSCHACH PATTERNS until --

           THE GLASS SHATTERS

           CRASHING down like rain, showering the startled Guards.  They 
           go for their guns but Kaulder and Chloe move like lightning.  
           Fast.  Precise.  Spectacular.  It’s over in a flash.

                                 KAULDER (CONT’D)
                             (into earpiece)

                                 TRAVIS (O.S.)
                        No units alerted -- At best, you 
                        got fifteen minutes.  That’s when 
                        the next shift comes on.

           Chloe heads to the nearby door.  It’s locked.   Chloe touches 
           the MECHANISM, the CAMERA following her fingers INSIDE as --

           THE METAL LOCK EXPANDS

           Tumbler SNAPPING like cardboard -- The door POPPING open.

           Travis studies the monitors.

                                 TRAVIS
                        A Metal Witch.  Okay, now I see why 
                        you brought her to the party.

                        out, two guards around the corner.
                             (beat)
                        I’m taking over the east cameras.  
                        You’ll be off the grid.

           INT. STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

           WHAP!  WHAP!  TWO GUARDS fall unconscious on the stairs, 
           Kaulder grabbing a BATON as he and Chloe CHARGE upwards.  
           Everything happening fast.

                                 TRAVIS (O.S.)
                        Good.  One more and you’re on 
                        Marbas’ cell block.

           They hit a door.  Try it.  Locked.  Chloe steps up, touching 
           her hand to it...but nothing happens.

                                 KAULDER
                        What’s the problem?

                        Give me a second --

           Do they have one?  Kaulder tightens, looking around.  
           Finally, we HEAR a SATISFYING CLACK, the door SWINGING open.

           INT. BATTERY UPPER LEVEL - SAME TIME

           Kaulder and Chloe stalk through the corridor, the mood’s 
           different down here.  Hushed and darkened.  A LAZY GUARD 
           watches a PORTABLE TELEVISION.  Behind him the CELL BLOCK 
           DOOR.

           Seeing our heroes, Lazy springs up, about to set off the 
           alarm -- At the last second, Kaulder WHIPS the baton through 
           the air, TARGETING Lazy, the man going down with a THUD.

           Chloe does her ‘thing’ at the door, both of them entering --

           INT. CELL BLOCK - SAME TIME

           It’s just plain creepy in here -- Lots of HAUNTED FACES and 
           CREEPY GRINS emerging from darkened cells.  The prisoners of 
           this block are not of sound mind and body.

           Kaulder stops before one particular cell, walls covered in 
           SCRAWLED GLYPHS and SYMBOLS.

           MARBAS (54) 
           Steps from the shadows, bearded and bald, we recognize him as 
           the mysterious figure with Belial in the transom -- He’s not 
           some kind of ‘God’, he’s only a man.  And a crazy one at that.  
           His eyes alight with oily lunacy.

                                 MARBAS
                        Well...After four hundred years the 
                        witch-hunter finally has a new 
                        ladyfriend...and she’s a witch.  
                        How sweet.

           He mutters under his breath, strange musings.  Fast and 
           impenetrable -- Kaulder twitches, this guy gets under his 
           skin.

                                 KAULDER
                        You’ve been keeping secrets.

                                 MARBAS
                        Secrets are all I have...thanks to 
                        you.

                                 KAULDER
                        You never told me about Belial.

           Marbas grins, he’s imagined this moment many times, revealing 
           his greatest accomplishment to the one man who can understand 
           its magnificence.

                                 MARBAS
                        When I found him he was so raw.  
                        Unspoiled.  I took him under my 
                        wing, taught him everything:  The 
                        ways of the Ancients, the secret 
                        names of Solomon -- I made him 
                        unique, taught him the ways of the 
                        totem...air, water, fire, light, any 
                        witch signature can be his...as long 
                        as he holds the right possession.   
                             (beat)
                        He thinks he’s outgrown me.  But 
                        he’s wrong.

                                 KAULDER
                        You hired Lorre...you’re the one 
                        who told him where to find the 
                        Goetia.

                                 MARBAS
                        Of course.  The job required 
                        Lorre’s gifts...it was buried 
                        within the church catacombs in 
                        Tunisia.
           This catches Kaulder by surprise.

                                 KAULDER
                        A church?

                                 MARBAS
                             (knowing)
                        Yes.  Odd, isn’t it?
                             (beat)
                        But all this dancing around, why 
                        don’t you ask me what you really 
                        want to know...where you can find 
                        the Goetia's other half.

           Kaulder looks to him, not understanding -- Marbas lets out a 
           gleeful sing-song, bouncing up and down.  Eyes his nemesis.  

                                 MARBAS (CONT’D)
                        ...For a man with over four-hundred 
                        candles on his birth cake, you’re 
                        not very bright...

           With sudden violence, Kaulder GRABS Marbas, PRESSES him 
           against the bars.

                                 KAULDER
                        Belial only has half the Goetia -- 
                        Where’s the rest?

           Marbas gives Kaulder his creepiest grin, the keeper of 
           secrets holding onto his trump card.

                                 MARBAS
                        Closer than you think. 
                             (beat)
                        I have no allegiance to Belial.  
                        Break me out of this cracker box, 
                        I’ll personally escort you to the 
                        other half --

           He’s interrupted by an ELECTRIC HUM, the lights around them 
           starting to FLICKER...

                                 MARBAS (CONT’D)
                        Interesting.

           He looks up, an OMINOUS POPPING SOUND cascading as...

           THE LIGHTS GO OUT ACROSS THE CELL BLOCK ONE BY ONE... 
           everything now lit solely by slats of SILVER MOONLIGHT.

           An ERIE BANSHEE WAIL pierces the cellblock.  Bone chilling.    

           Kaulder touches his earpiece.
                                 KAULDER
                             (into earpiece)
                        Travis, what’s going on?

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME

           Travis stares at the monitors...they’ve all gone blank -- He 
           flips a SERIES OF SWITCHES, tapping into the city’s grid.

                                 TRAVIS
                             (transmitting)
                        You tell me.  The whole prison’s 
                        gone dark -- Power outage?

           INT. CELL BLOCK - SAME TIME

           Chloe peers into the blackness, shakes her head.

                                 CHLOE
                        It’s them.

           FIVE SHAPES 

           GLIDE through the darkness, CLOAKED IN BLACK, cadaverous 
           faces wreathed in LEATHERED GAS-MASK DEVICES...as fast as 
           they appear, they’re gone, slipping back into SHADOW.  
           Icelandic Witches.  The LANDNÁMABÓK.

                                 KAULDER
                        The Landnámabók...
                             (beat)
                        Shadow shifters.

           The coven move through the block like sharks, FLITTERING 
           between POOLS OF DARKNESS, hints of GREY MOTTLED SKIN beneath 
           their masks.  Eerie stuff -- Marbas chilled with sudden fear.

                                 MARBAS
                        They’re coming for me.

           ONE LANDNÁMABÓK

           APPEARS beside Kaulder, CURVED BLADE in its hand!  It 
           attacks, Kaulder DODGING and SPINNING to counter -- But the 
           witch is already gone, MELTING back into shadow.

           IT’S LIKE FIGHTING GHOSTS, CHLOE kicking off the cell bars, 
           DIVING as TWO LANDNÁMABÓK SWIPE THEIR BLADES where she was 
           just standing.  Fast.  Lethal.  Skittery. 

                                 KAULDER
                        Get behind me.
           Chloe dives behind him and...in one swift move, Kaulder 
           throws his coat over her, SNAPPING a PHOSPHOROUS GRENADE from 
           his belt, THROWING it to the ground.  

           The air before him IGNITES WITH GREEN LIGHT, two Landnámabók 
           SLICKING into pools of black with a SCREECH!  The Phosphorous 
           EVAPORATES, plunging the block back into night as --

           A CURVED BLADE

           SLICES Kaulder's side, drawing blood, Chloe looking to see 
           Kaulder’s attacker emerging from a shadow in Marbas’s cell.  

                                 CHLOE
                        Kaulder!

           Kaulder looks, the Landnámabók already pulling Marbas into 
           darkness, both of them DISAPPEARING and REAPPEARING two cells 
           over, FLITTERING in and out of the moonlight, always EMERGING 
           further down the cell.

           CHLOE

           Runs, doing a quick calculation -- She touches a cell’s bars, 
           DISSOLVING the metal, stepping through just as --

           THE LANDNÁMABÓK

           Appears with Marbas, Chloe having anticipated their next 
           emergence.  She RIPS the gas-mask from the witch’s face -- 
           It SHRIEKS horribly, unable to breathe our atmosphere, 
           quickly SLITHERING back into the safety of shadows.

           Chloe GRABS Marbas, throws him to Kaulder, PRISONERS now 
           SCREAMING and JABBERING all around them.  Complete bedlam.  
           Kaulder studies the darkness.

                                 KAULDER
                        We have to get him out...

           He wavers a moment, Chloe seeing BLOOD pooled to the floor 
           around him -- She opens his coat, revealing a BLADE WOUND in 
           his side.

                                 CHLOE
                        You’re hurt.

                                 KAULDER
                        I’m fine.

                                 CHLOE
                        No, you’re not -- The Landnámabók 
                        coat their blades with a paralyzing 
                        poison --
           Kaulder ignores her warning, charging forward with Marbas -- 
           Chloe follows, the three of them threading through the cell 
           block door, making it out into...  

           INT. BATTERY UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT

           A FUSILLADE of BULLETS!

           BLAM BLAM!  Rounds CHEW up the wall next to their heads!  
           It’s THREE PRISON GUARDS -- Our heroes duck behind the guard 
           desk, Lazy Guard still lying where he went down. 

           Kaulder touches his earpiece.

                                 KAULDER
                        Travis...we’re pinned down here.  
                        Anything you can do?

                                 TRAVIS (O.S.)
                             (transmitted)
                        I’m still dead in the water.

           Kaulder looks to the Guards, nods to Chloe.

           Chloe lets three knives fly, the blades BURYING in the 
           Guard’s shoes, PINNING them to the floor!  They HOWL, Marbas 
           leering to Kaulder, clapping his hands together like a child. 

                                 MARBAS
                        Makes you wonder who’s side you’re 
                        on, huh?

           Chloe looks to Kaulder, sees a sheen of sweat coating his 
           face.  He stumbles, Chloe having to support him now.

                                 CHLOE
                        The poison’s taking effect...If we 
                        don’t get you out of here soon, you 
                        have a serious problem.

           She help him forward, the three of them heading out --

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Chaotic.  Frenetic.  Barrelling down the stairs, BLURS OF 
           MOVEMENT in the dark around them.  Is it the Landnámabók?

           Suddenly, the lights flicker to life, the HUM of electricity 
           echoing through the stairwell.

                                 KAULDER
                        Travis?
           INT. CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME

           Travis watches as the monitors bloom before him, catching our 
           heroes on one screen.

                                 TRAVIS
                        I tapped the grid.  Got it running.

           His eyes flick to the other monitors, quick blurs of GUARDS 
           running around, trying to make sense of things.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT’D)
                        Okay...the good news is everyone’s 
                        distracted.  Keep heading to the 
                        main level.

           INT. STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

           Kaulder tumbles, Chloe drags him to his feet.  He staggers on 
           -- It’s all up to her now.

           INT. BATTERY PRISON (FRONT LOBBY) - SAME TIME

           A COLLECTION OF GUARDS work to get the operations back up, 
           broken glass littering the floor around them.

           The stairwell door BURSTS open.  WHAP!  WHAP!  WHAP!  Chloe’s 
           a BLUR, taking the Guards down, before they even know what 
           hit ‘em -- Kaulder can only spectate, pressed against the 
           wall near Marbas.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Freeze!

           All eyes turn.  FIVE OFFICERS block the front door, guns 
           trained -- Chloe raises her hands, Kaulder sagging, sliding 
           down the wall.  He’s running out of time. 

           Chloe’s helpless, the cops moving in, weapons pointed.

           What happens next happens fast:

           ACROSS THE FLOOR

           The Landnámabók RISES from a pool of shadow, SNATCHING Marbas 
           away in the blink of an eye, flittering back into ebony.  An 
           apparition.

           The cops blink, did they just see that?  They exchange looks, 
           momentarily distracted.

           A moment is all Chloe needs.
           Chloe spins, WHIRRING and KICKING, taking the men out with a 
           few TARGETED KICKS.  Beautiful.  

           In the distance, the sound of APPROACHING SIRENS.

           EXT. BATTERY PRISON - CONTINUOUS

           Chloe makes her way down the steps as best she can, trying to 
           support Kaulder, eyes rolling up in his head.

                                 KAULDER
                        Leave me here.

           She shakes him, Kaulder doing his best to hold on as --

           POLICE CARS

           WHIP around the corner, SIRENS blaring.

                                 CHLOE
                        I have to get you somewhere safe.

           She supports his weight, the two of them ducking down an 
           alleyway, disappearing into the night.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HELL’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The CHATTERING BABEL of a MIDNIGHT MARKET.

           Belial, Bullmastiff and two of his generals at his side, 
           heads through the maze, VENDORS hawking their wares.  
           Clothes.  Spices.  Lots of pirated DVDs.  

                                 BELIAL
                        Bring Marbas in when he arrives.

           He strides into a darkened storefront, Bullmastiff 
           following...

           INT. THORN APPLE FLORIST - NIGHT

           This place is stunning.  Chic.  Magical.  Bushels of 
           IMPOSSIBLY COLORED FLOWERS, BOUQUETS entwined into INTRICATE 
           ORGANIC SHAPES.  The only people who can afford these 
           creations have Park Avenue addresses.

           RÅUM, an OLDER SLOVAKIAN WOMAN, stands behind the counter, 
           counting up the day’s ample proceeds -- She looks up to see 
           Belial standing before her. 

                                 RÅUM
                        So...it’s time.
           INT. THORN APPLE FLORIST (BACK ROOM) - NIGHT

           There’s no floor here, only dirt, DOZENS OF SMALL PLANTS 
           growing from the soil.  In the center, an OLEANDER TREE 
           spreads its branches, gnarled wood cramped tight across the 
           ceiling.  Beautiful.

           As they talk, Råum waters the plants, leading Belial through 
           a rat’s nest of GLASS TUBES and BEAKERS, ROOTS AND VINES. 

                                 BELIAL
                        It’s dispiriting...the great Råum 
                        reduced to decorating socialite 
                        parties just to survive...

                                 RÅUM
                        In times such as this a witch does 
                        what one has to, no?

                                 BELIAL
                        Not for much longer.

           Råum stops -- Eyes Belial.

                                 RÅUM
                        I wonder if you understand the 
                        complexities of the earth you 
                        trifle with.
                             (pointed)
                        It’s taken my family over two 
                        hundred years to grow what you 
                        needed...What you’re asking for, 
                        it’s our crowning achievement.

           She unrolls a COVERED TARP off a LARGE EARTHEN OBJECT in the 
           corner...revealing --

           A WOODEN MACHINE

           We recognize it, the harness for the Goetia -- An EMPTY 
           OPENING in its heart, awaiting the Plague Box itself.

           Belial’s hands caress the wood, eyes alight.

                                 BELIAL
                        It’s perfect.

           THROUGH THE DOORWAY

           General #1 enters, clutching Marbas.  He’s trembling, wet 
           with a viscous sheen, still recovering from his time with the 
           Landnámabók -- Belial grins warmly.
                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Marbas.
                             (embracing him)
                        In the flesh.  At last.

           Marbas doesn’t notice that -- while they embraced -- Belial 
           plucked something from his shoulder.

                                 MARBAS
                        I don’t appreciate you sending the 
                        Landnámabók...the human mind can 
                        only handle so much.  

                                 BELIAL
                        What?  You didn’t enjoy your trip 
                        through the Shadow Realm?  You left 
                        me no choice, forcing my hand like 
                        that --

                                 MARBAS
                        -- You think I’m the type to just 
                        rot in prison, waiting for you to 
                        deliver on your word?

                                 BELIAL
                        But in the end I did deliver. 
                        You’re a free man.  So...now it’s 
                        your turn:  Where can I find the 
                        other half of the Goetia?  

           A beat.  Marbas silent...hands fidgeting across each other.

                                 MARBAS
                        I don’t have a clue...It was all a 
                        bluff.  

           But one look and Belial can tell the real truth: Marbas 
           knows, but he’s not willing to risk the fate of humanity.

           Belial’s jovial demeanor quickly fades.

                                 BELIAL
                        I see.  So you are human after all.
                             (beat)
                        That’s a pity...

           His hand reveals a SINGLE HAIR taken from Marbas’s shoulder.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        I presume you know what this is...

           Marbas touches his head, realizing -- And as Belial says the 
           following, his fingers play with the hair, Marbas growing 
           more nervous by the second...
                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        And...what did you teach me about 
                        matter...personal matter?
                             (recalling)
                        Over time a piece of that person 
                        becomes one with the matter -- 
                        Which means when I take your matter 
                        ...a piece of you becomes mine.

           And with that, he pulls the hair into a knot --  Marbas 
           suddenly grabbing his chest in pain, seizing up.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Now...old friend, you’re going to 
                        show me where I can find the rest 
                        of the Plague Box.

           And off the SCREECH OF A RAILWAY we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Chloe shouldering Kaulder, a feverish sweat covering him as 
           they head into a subway station.

           INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

           Our heroes cross the station, at this hour it’s deserted -- 
           Chloe noticing Kaulder’s RAGGED BREATHING.

           He lurches, going to the edge of the platform, Chloe helping 
           him down.

           INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

           The DISTANT RUMBLE of a train, Chloe shouldering Kaulder 
           through the darkness.  Swirls of rail dust cover every 
           surface.  They come to a SCUFFED METAL DOOR, above it a sign 
           reading: KNICKERBOCKER  

                                 KAULDER
                        Old speakeasy entrance to the 
                        Knickerbocker Hotel.  
                             (rasping)
                        It’s home.

           His fingers fumble, pulling an ORNATE KEY, opening the door.

           INT. KAULDER’S SANCTUM - NIGHT

           It’s dark.  The two of them head down a set of stairs,  
           Kaulder flipping a mechanical switch, GAS LAMPS illuminating 
           a CAVERNOUS CHAMBER.  Spectral.  Beautiful.
                                 CHLOE
                        My God...

           Her eyes take in the collection of artifacts: BOTTLES OF 
           SPANISH RUM, STONE BUDDHA HEADS, ARTISAN WOOD BOXES, CIVIL 
           WAR MUSKETS, the treasures go on and on -- Anywhere else?  
           Priceless.  Here?  Keepsakes from a life gone by.

           She stops, staring at the 16th-Century Portraits of  
           Kaulder’s wife and child -- This is a sacred place.  

           Kaulder strips off his shirt to reveal a RAILROAD OF SCARS 
           across his body -- He stumbles, Chloe reaching for him... 
           Kaulder pulls away.  

                                 KAULDER
                        I’m okay --

                                 CHLOE
                        Eternity trapped in a paralyzed 
                        body’s a lot of things.  ‘Okay’?  
                        Not on the list. 

           She quickly looks through the chamber, hunting for something 
           that could help -- Kaulder wavers, poison coursing through 
           his body -- But then...suddenly --

           He stops...Eyes alighting on a rusted metal cross.  Struck by 
           a realization.

                                 KAULDER
                             (slurred)
                         -- the second piece...

           But before he can finish -- WHAM! -- His limbs go numb and 
           foreign, collapsing to the stone floor, overcome...the SOUND 
           OF CRASHING WAVES and SEAGULLS as --

           EXT. FREIGHTER (DARK AGES) - DAY

           Kaulder’s eyes FLASH open, he’s aboard the Black Watch 
           freighter, the grime of battlesmoke still on his face -- His 
           hand clutches the tattered remains of the Velveteen Bird.

                                 GROSETTE 
                        Don’t talk...

           Grosette appears before him, relieved to see Kaulder awake, 
           the monk pouring water down Kaulder’s forehead and throat.

                                 GROSETTE (CONT’D)
                        -- You’ve been unconscious for 
                        three days.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GROSETTE (CONT’D)
                        Even still, we couldn’t pull that 
                        ‘damn toy out of your hand.

                                 KAULDER
                             (weak)
                        I saw a Queen...

                                 GROSETTE
                        I know...Never have I seen such 
                        selfless bravery in battle, when we 
                        reach shore no less than the Pope 
                        himself will demand your 
                        appearance.

           Kaulder manages to glance down, seeing the Black Scar above 
           his heart...and something even more amazing -- 

                                 GROSETTE (CONT’D)
                        Yes.  The wound from your sword 
                        ...its healed into a scar.  God’s 
                        will be done --

           Kaulder shudders, knowing ‘God’ had nothing to do with it.

                                 KAULDER
                        The Plague Box.  What happened to 
                        it?

           A BEAT, waves CRASH against the side of the freighter -- 
           Grosette’s eyes glance toward the lower deck of the ship.

                                 GROSETTE
                        We destroyed it.
                             (beat)
                        Come now, you must rest...The Great 
                        Sickness is no more!  The Brigade 
                        has triumphed --

           Kaulder’s suddenly beset by a WRACKING COUGH -- His hand 
           CLUTCHING the Velveteen Bird, eyes SQUEEZED SHUT in pain... 
           and when he opens them again he finds himself --

           INT. KAULDER’S SANCTUM (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT

           -- Lying on his bed.  The chamber now lit by candlelight.

           He sits up, a wrapped MOIST POULSTICE now spread over his 
           wound.  He looks healthy, the poison gone.

                                 CHLOE (O.S.)
                        Old witch remedy -- Something my 
                        sister taught me.
           Kaulder looks over to see Chloe kneeling in front of a candle 
           -- She’s clutching Düer’s ring, the first chance she’s had to 
           mourn.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        She wasn’t scared of dying, she 
                        used to say it just meant 
                        ‘nothingness’...and who could be 
                        scared of nothing?
                             (beat)
                        She was frightened of something 
                        else... 

           She turns, her voice barely a whisper.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        The feeling you’d get at the last 
                        second...when you realize your 
                        chance of becoming who you wanted 
                        to be is gone forever...and the 
                        broken person you were?  That’s all 
                        anyone’ll remember.

           She looks to Kaulder, vulnerable in a way we haven’t seen 
           before, the moment strangely intimate -- She reaches forward, 
           touching the black scar over his heart.  

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        I’m tired of who I am...I want to 
                        be better.   

           HER TOUCH...

           On his bare skin is like a firebrand.  Hot.  Alive.  Sensual -- 
           An intense beat, the two of them staring.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        Who were you...before you became a 
                        witch hunter?

                                 KAULDER
                        A farmer.

           She likes this, smiles, her hand sliding to his face.  She 
           leans in closer...but, at the last second...Kaulder stops her.

           Chloe looks to him.

                                 CHLOE
                        Is it because of my sister?  Was 
                        there something going on?
           It’s obvious the question’s been on her mind.  A long moment, 
           Chloe forcing Kaulder to hold her gaze...finally, he shakes 
           his head. 

                                 KAULDER
                        She was a witch.

           This seems to hurt Chloe even more -- He stares, unsure what 
           else to say, not used to the intimacy of the moment.

                                 KAULDER (CONT’D)
                        Marbas said the first piece of the 
                        Goetia was buried under a church.  
                             (beat)
                        There’s somewhere I have to go... 
                        But I have to do it alone.

           The way he says this, not so much the usual Kaulder order... 
           it comes out softer.  Chloe nods -- And with a last look at 
           her, Kaulder rises, strength returning.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ST. JOHN’S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

           The structure framed in moonlight...

           INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

           Dolan kneels before a FIELD OF LIT CANDLES.  The old man 
           looks enfeebled, obviously troubled.

                                 KAULDER (O.S.)
                        Praying for your sins?

           Caught off guard, the Cardinal turns to find Kaulder.  

                                 DOLAN
                        Where have you been?  You break 
                        into a federal prison, unleashing a 
                        known killer into the city?  Have 
                        you gone mad --

           He stops, his frail body suddenly wracked with a VIOLENT 
           COUGH -- Kaulder stares.  Defiant.

                                 KAULDER
                        The Church sent my brigade into the 
                        witch nest to posses the Plague Box 
                        ...not to destroy it.

           A beat -- The Cardinal glancing back at the altar, looking 
           for strength.
                                 DOLAN
                        If you knew the thing’s done in God’s 
                        name --

                                 KAULDER
                        -- Men died that day.  Good men. 

                                 DOLAN
                        The Church’s influence was fading, 
                        it was thought if an affliction  
                        targeted the Church’s human enemies 
                        it’d be proof of our divine 
                        sovereignty. 

           Kaulder stares, stricken by this information.

                                 KAULDER
                        The Church attempted to use witch 
                        technology against our own kind --

                                 DOLAN
                        -- The greatest minds were brought 
                        in to unlock the Goetia's mysteries 
                        ...but, in the end, none could.  
                             (beat)
                        The Archbishop determined the 
                        Plague Box should be separated and 
                        buried -- Half in the reaches of 
                        the Middle East...and half in a 
                        Dutch colonial settlement in the 
                        new world...New Amsterdam. 
                             (beat)
                        You remember how glorious the first 
                        cathedral in the settlement was, 
                        don’t you?  It was destroyed years 
                        ago...but the well beneath it 
                        remains intact.
                             (beat)
                        That’s where you’ll find the second 
                        piece.

           Kaulder takes in his baroque surroundings, eyes piercing.

                                 KAULDER
                        As of this moment...I no longer 
                        hunt in His name.

           He turns to leave, Dolan stopping him.

                                 DOLAN
                        You’d be wise not to judge harshly, 
                        witch hunter.  We all have demons 
                        ...some haunt more than others.
                                 KAULDER
                        Everything that happened to me 
                        ...happened because of that day.  
                        Everything.

           He exits, the old man left standing alone in the cavernous 
           chamber.

           EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

           Kaulder heads down the stone steps, finds Chloe waiting for 
           him astride a DUCATI MOTORCYCLE -- She stops, struck.  Sees 
           the pained look in Kaulder’s eyes.  

                                 CHLOE
                        You okay?

           Kaulder nods, looks to the cycle.

                                 KAULDER
                        How’d you get this?

           Chloe’s nails CLICK the throttle -- The motorcycle PURRING to 
           life.

                                 CHLOE
                        These fingers do amazing things.

           Kaulder nods, taking one last lingering look at the cathedral 
           ...And with the ROAR of an engine...

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Kaulder and Chloe HURTLE down the street atop the cycle.  
           Beautiful.  Sculpted.  The city BLURS past, the Ducati 
           KNIFING beneath a METAL SIGN reading: CHINATOWN

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - NIGHT

           A midnight ‘Ghost Market’.

           We TRAIL a BEAUTIFUL GIRL carrying an open case as she PUSHES 
           through a CROWD OF MEN -- Lots of NOISE and CHAOS,  money 
           exchanging hands.  

                                 BEAUTIFUL GIRL
                        Rice cakes...cigarettes...

           As she passes, we see SMALL CAGES on pedestals, the men 
           SHOUTING as HORNED BEETLES fight each other to the death.  
           Combat on an insect-sized scale.
           The CAMERA moves through the cacophony, cutting past STALLS 
           selling ROAST DUCK, TEXTILES and FIREWORKS, until finally we 
           find...

           AN ABANDONED TENEMENT

           Old and crumbling -- FOUR ASIAN GANG MEMBERS loiter in the 
           doorway, WITCHMARK EMBLEMS telling us they’re not your usual 
           street trash. 

           INT. ABANDONED TENEMENT - NIGHT

           A hive of activity.  

           What was once a derelict lobby is now an excavation site, the 
           foundation ripped up, MOUNDS OF EARTH dug into massive piles.  

           DOZENS OF WITCHES of all stripes toil...Asians, Afrikaans, 
           Haitians, Brazilian...all working shoulder to shoulder.

           We MOVE to the BUSTLING CENTER, Belial and Marbas are there, 
           standing beside a SWARTHY WITCH wielding a shovel.  He THUNKS 
           it down -- STOPS -- Hearing a SHARP SOUND.  

                                 SWARTHY
                        I hit something.

           Belial brushes away dirt, revealing a STONE COVERING -- He 
           SHOVES the heavy stone aside, revealing --

           A DEEP WELL

           Murky and black.  Too dark to see how deep it goes.

           Marbas moves to the edge, looks to the diggers.

                                 MARBAS
                        Magicks would’ve set off a trap -- 
                        But you still need a human to go 
                        down with you...the Church wouldn’t 
                        bury anything without a defense 
                        mechanism.

           Belial nods, looks to a Guard.

                                 BELIAL
                        Make sure no one else gets near 
                        this well.

           Marbas offers himself a slight grin.  Up to something.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

           Across from the tenement, a large construction area filled 
           with heavy equipment.  At this hour it’s deserted...except 
           for TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES nestled in a cement pipe.  

           Kaulder and Chloe study the building, watching as more 
           witches enter and exit through the front door.

                                 KAULDER
                        Any sign of Marbas?

           Chloe nods, spotting two Tattooed Witch Guards on the roof.

                                 CHLOE
                        And at least eight different covens 
                        inside and out.  How the hell we 
                        going to get in...and even better -- 
                        How we going to get out?

           Kaulder eyes an INDUSTRIAL LIGHT RIG.  An idea forming -- He 
           unclips two of his Phosphorous Light Wands, unscrewing the 
           tops, green fluid SLOSHING about.  

                                 KAULDER
                             (looks to Chloe)
                        Count to five hundred.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TENEMENT - NIGHT

           The CAMERA DRIFTS ALONG THE TENEMENT WALL to find:

           KAULDER

           Shadowed in darkness, deftly crawling up the side of the 
           building.  He works fast, every crevice a handhold...we see a 
           CLOCK strapped to his wrist COUNTING UP: 27, 28, 29

           Suddenly, the Velveteen Bird drops from the folds of Kaulder’s 
           coat!  He catches it at the last second, DANGLING nosily by 
           one hand!  Below him, a sheer ten story drop as --

           EXT. ON THE ROOF - SAME TIME

           An Asian Guard hears the NOISE, heading over to take a look --

           ON KAULDER

           Gripping the building with one hand, ‘Purifier’ now clutched 
           in the other, gun barrel aimed directly above --

           ON THE GUARD
           About to look down, right at Kaulder...but at the last second 
           -- THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY MACHINERY distract him --

           ACROSS THE STREET

           A construction crane LURCHES to life, EXHAUST SMOKE billowing.

           THE GUARD

           Watches, distracted momentarily by the machine -- Finally, he 
           heads back to his post, the original disturbance forgotten.

           KAULDER

           Still dangling, looks to see Chloe manning the crane.  She 
           gives him a look -- Coast now clear, Kaulder sheathes his 
           gun, CLIMBING upward. 

           Finally, he makes it to --

           THE ROOF

           He climbs over, quietly approaching the two Guards from 
           behind -- Before either of them have a chance to cast, he 
           takes them both out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WELL - NIGHT

           Belial and Marbas lower themselves on coils of rope, 
           FLICKERING TORCHES splitting the gloom.  

           They touch down amidst a COLLECTION OF ARCANE ARTIFACTS: 
           Tapestries, ancient armaments, tomes.  A small assembly of 
           items that haven’t seen daylight for a very long time.

                                 MARBAS
                        It’s a storehouse for the Church’s 
                        most private secrets...things they 
                        didn’t want Kaulder to know about.

           His eyes light up, if you didn’t know any better you’d think 
           Marbas won the lottery.  

           He finds a GLASS JAR filled with POWDERS and TINCTURES -- 
           Making sure Belial’s not looking, he quietly unscrews the 
           lid, carefully pulling out... 

           TWO TINY VIALS

           One filled with an AMBER LIQUID, the other a RED LIQUID. 
           Acting fast, he pockets both as, from across the chamber, he 
           hears Belial calling out --
                                 BELIAL
                        I found it.

           Marbas advances to see Belial crouched before a LACQUERED 
           WOODEN BOX (identical to Chloe’s).  He reaches forward, but 
           Marbas stays his hand.

                                 MARBAS
                        I should open it...stand as far 
                        back as you can.

           Belial shoots him a dark look, nodding toward Marbas’ hair 
           now affixed to his totem twine.

                                 BELIAL
                        If you’re playing some kind of 
                        game, unleashing the Plague will be 
                        the least of your worries.

           Marbas nods solemnly -- Crouching before the wood box as 
           Belial watches from a safe distance...coiled with excitement.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        All these years, deep in the 
                        earth...quietly awaiting my 
                        arrival.

           Marbas snaps up a chunk of limestone, CRASHING it atop a 
           chain surrounding the box.  The chain SNAPS, Marbas slowly 
           opening the box...  

           INSIDE THE BOX

           AN ANCIENT WINCH rigged to smash open a GLASS GLOBE filled 
           with WHITE POWDER.  Marbas was right -- The box was rigged.

           Moving deftly, Marbas breaks the winch, carefully pulling the 
           globe out.  Holds it up.

                                 MARBAS
                        Salt.

           Now safe, Belial crouches to the box...

           INSIDE

           An OBJECT wrapped in cloth -- Belial grins, carefully folding 
           the fabric back to reveal the Goetia.

                                 BELIAL
                        At last...it’s mine.

           Marbas takes advantage of his distraction, raising the glass 
           globe above his head as --
           WHAM!  He SMASHES the globe to the ground -- A CLOUD OF SALT 
           filling the chamber -- Belial WRITHES in agony, the substance 
           striking his flesh like acid!

           Marbas acts fast, grabbing up the Plague Piece and tearing 
           his hair from Belial’s twine, quickly heading back up the 
           rope -- Belial’s AGONIZED SCREAMS swallowed in the caverns 
           as...

           INT. TENEMENT (STAIRS) - NIGHT

           Kaulder’s inside now, quickly moving down the stairway, now 
           wearing one guard’s cloak and hat, CHINESE GRAFFITI scrawled 
           across the walls around him.  He looks to the CLOCK:  112, 
           113, 114...

           INT. TENEMENT (FIRST FLOOR)

           Kaulder emerges onto the main floor, witches are everywhere.  
           The mood’s uneasy, covens not used to working side by side 
           like this. 

           He wades his way forward, surrounded on all sides by his 
           enemies, head down at all times. 

           Finally, he makes his way close to the well.  A CIRCLE OF 
           WITCH GUARDS around it, one BURLY GUARD shoves Kaulder back.

                                 BURLY GUARD
                        What you doin’ -- Stay BACK!

           Kaulder steps away, a group of witches eyeing him...a TENSE 
           BEAT...will he be recognized?

           Suddenly, a COMMOTION from the other side of the guard line --  
           Marbas emerging from the well with the Plague Piece.  Lots of 
           jostling, everyone moving forward to grab a look.

                                 BURLY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Everyone stay back!  Belial’s 
                        orders!

           But the witches are hard to contain, becoming feverish, 
           Kaulder seeing an opportunity -- He SLUGS Burly in the face, 
           Burly PROPELLING Kaulder into a group of PUERTO RICAN WITCHES. 

                                 PUERTO RICAN WITCH #1
                        Hey!

           It’s akin to lighting the fuse of a powder keg, the Puerto 
           Ricans SURGING forward, air crackling with witch energy.
           Insults in witchtounge get bandied back and forth, guttural 
           and nasty:  Colombians taunting Jamaicans, Asians pushing 
           Mexicans, Vietnamese spitting at Samoans.

           We’ve got us a WITCH RIOT brewing here.

           The guards are distracted, having trouble keeping things 
           contained -- Kaulder uses it to his advantage, slipping 
           through the line unnoticed.  He glances at the CLOCK:  411, 
           412, 413...

           Marbas finishes pulling himself up from the well, gripping 
           the second half of the Plague Box -- He looks up, startled to 
           see Kaulder stomping towards him.

                                 MARBAS
                        Kaulder, wait.  Don’t do 
                        something you might regret --

                                 KAULDER
                        Wouldn’t dream of it.

           WHAM!  He floors Marbas with a SHARP KICK, snapping up the 
           Piece, quickly DARTING into the crowd -- But he’s no longer 
           covered by a hat, his face plain to see.

           And one SKINNY WITCH does.

           He stops, points.

                                 SKINNY WITCH
                             (calling out)
                        The witch-hunter!

           His voice cuts through the din -- Everyone stops, stares, as 
           if the very tenement itself were holding its breath.

           Our hero stands.  Surrounded.  One versus dozens.

           KAULDER

           Pulls the ‘Purifier’, light gleaming off the barrel.  He 
           focuses it across the space, willfully keeping the witches at 
           bay, steadily moving backwards until he arrives at...

           The tenement wall.

           The covens slowly move in, hundreds of witch nails CLICKING 
           ...Kaulder keeping his eyes trained at all times, making a 
           quick calculation, stepping over just a smidgen.

           The tension finally breaks with a YELL, Swarthy Witch BRUTALLY 
           TACKLING Kaulder, CATCHING A LOOK AT THE WATCH FACE --
           AS IT READS: ...499, 500

           WHAM!  The wall next to Kaulder EXPLODES INWARD, a ONE-TON 
           WRECKING BALL SMASHING ITS WAY THROUGH, Swarthy sent FLYING 
           across the atrium like a rag doll!

           A GIANT SHAFT OF PHOSPHOROUS LIGHT

           Pours through the hole, KNIFING through bodies like a 
           radioactive laser, witches SCREECHING and SLICKING into black 
           ooze by the dozen!

           The survivors edge away from the line of light, moving toward 
           Kaulder, ready to attempt another attack but --

           BOOOOM!  The wall to the left of Kaulder FRAGMENTS into 
           thousands of pieces -- the ball releasing another BLINDING 
           SHAFT OF LIGHT into the atrium, Kaulder now protected from 
           both flanks!

           Not wasting a beat, Kaulder DARTS outside -- 

           EXT. TENEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           He’s forced to shield his eyes from the GREEN GLARE of 
           phosphorus light blaring from the construction rigging, 
           barely able to see Chloe in the cab of the swinging crane.

           And then it all goes to hell.

           With a POP and HISS, the rigging SHORTS OUT, bulbs not 
           engineered for this purpose -- Out of tricks, Chloe emerges 
           from the construction crane.  Yells to Kaulder.

                                 CHLOE
                        You have it?

           He shows her the Piece, witches already pouring out the 
           building behind him...Acting fast, our heroes jump atop the 
           waiting Ducati -- It GUNS to life with a THROATY ROAR.  They 
           race away.

           THE COVENS 

           Already amassing to pursue, Asians jumping onto tuned 
           motorcycles and into muscle cars...but at the last second...

                                 BELIAL  (O.S.)
                        Stop!

           Belial emerges from the folds of the tenement, salt scars now 
           lining his flesh...they have a strange beauty...more like 
           tribal scars. 
                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take care of it.

           He smiles darkly...hand touching an UNSEEN OBJECT on his 
           totem twine, striding forward.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Kaulder and Chloe ride past industrial warehouses, 
           silhouetted in the night.

                                 CHLOE
                        So, what now?  Take it to the 
                        Church?

           Kaulder shakes his head.

                                 KAULDER
                        We do what they should’ve done a 
                        long time ago.
                             (beat)
                        Destroy it.

                                 CHLOE
                        How?  

           Kaulder nods toward a PLUME OF SMOKE rising in the sky ahead, 
           the exhaust of a MANUFACTURING PLANT -- He GUNS the throttle 
           to head toward it, but before he can... 

           A BLUR OF MOVEMENT 

           VAULTS from the darkness...The Bullmastiff LEAPS at Kaulder, 
           canines catching, Kaulder THROWN from the Ducati, ROLLING 
           across the pavement locked in struggle.

           ON THE CYCLE

           Chloe SNATCHES the handlebars but its too late -- The Ducati 
           SLIDES along the asphalt, SMASHING through the glass of a 
           MARKET STOREFRONT! 

           ON THE STREET

           The Bullmastiff’s jaws SNAP inches from Kaulder’s neck, teeth 
           CLAMPING around Kaulder’s hand!  Kaulder SCREAMS in pain, the 
           dog’s powerful grip forcing him to drop the Plague Piece.

           He looks up to now find...

           BELIAL 
           Hand brushing past his totem twine, revealing Glaeser’s Ebony 
           Ring as he picks up the Plague Piece.

                                 BELIAL
                        I’ve got the power of the Ancients 
                        behind me now.

           His fingernails CLICK, time slowing to a crawl as...

           All luminescence is SUCKED from nearby molecules...
           Orbits of moonlight SWALLOWED...
           The street now ENGULFED in veils of midnight.  
           Complete darkness.  

           A SPELL UNLEASHES

           SLICES OF AIR ripple through the void, HURTLING toward --

           KAULDER

           He PIVOTS at the last second, asphalt beneath him FRAGMENTING 
           and EXPLODING into hundreds of shards...

           Kaulder pulls the ‘Purifier’ with blistering speed, FIRING A 
           BURST OF ROUNDS, the ensuing battle continuing down the 
           street as...

           INT. MARKET - SAME TIME

           Everything quiet.  BITS OF GLASS litter the floor, a single 
           wheel of the overturned Ducati slowly spinning.

           Chloe lies unconscious beneath it.

           A FIGURE

           Enters through the broken window, a pool of light revealing 
           ...Marbas!  He goes to Chloe, kneeling before her prone body.

                                 MARBAS
                        Wakey, wakey...

           He grins darkly as...

           EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

           FAST AND FURIOUS COMBAT sweeps through an empty street, 
           Kaulder’s eyes locked on the Plague Piece still gripped in 
           Belial’s hand.

           Brick and cement SHATTER on impact, Kaulder barely able to 
           keep it together as Belial attacks with a combination of 
           muscle, spells and speed.
           WHAM!  A concussive blast SLAMS into Kaulder, his body 
           SPIKING across the pavement, knocking the fight out of him -- 
           Kaulder lies on the ground.  Beaten.

           Belial steps forward, looming. 

                                 BELIAL
                        In your story you’re the hero:  
                        Captain Kaulder.  Vengeful warrior.   
                        Hunting to protect his own kind 
                        ...but what if your kind are the 
                        real monsters?  What would that 
                        make you?

           He raises his palm, nails poised to click...

           A WHITE-HOT SPOTLIGHT 

           Lands on Kaulder.  Is it a spell?

           No...The ROAR OF A ROTOR splits the gloom, Kaulder looking up 
           to see a POLICE HELICOPTER circling above.  

           Belial gazes upward.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        And these are the people you fight 
                        for?  They see you as the enemy. 

           POLICE CARS SCREECH before Kaulder, OFFICERS leaping out, 
           guns drawn.  

                                 OFFICER #1
                             (into mic.)
                        -- Suspect from Battery prison in 
                        sight, request backup.

           Kaulder glances back to find Belial now gone...and so is the 
           Plague Piece -- But what can he do?  He lies on the ground, 
           gripped in the spotlight, a dozen guns pointed right at him 
           as...

           INT. MARKET - SAME TIME

           Marbas’ fingertips spider across Chloe’s face.  With a grin, 
           he leans in close, smelling her.  He MOANS, his touch 
           starting to slide delicately down her body, until...

           Chloe’s eyes FLASH open.

           Fast as anything, she SPRINGS up, hand GRABBING Marbas’ 
           throat, pinning him to the cycle.
                                 MARBAS
                        -- Wait!  It’s not what it looks 
                        like -- I came here to help you.  
                        You actually think I want Belial to 
                        use the Plague Box...?

           Chloe uses her craft, the wheel of the Ducati suddenly 
           BLAZING to life, SPINNING lethally fast, a mere inch from 
           Marbas’ head -- Marbas sweats.

                                 MARBAS (CONT’D)
                             (straining)
                        Listen.  You want to take Belial 
                        down?  All you have to do is cut 
                        his totem twine...without it, he’s 
                        nothing.  Helpless.  Practically 
                        human.

                                 CHLOE
                        And I should believe you ‘cause --

                                 MARBAS
                        I’ll show you...
                             (hand fumbles to his 
                              pocket)
                        I was using Belial to get what I 
                        really wanted....things buried with 
                        the Plague Piece...things the Church 
                        didn’t want Kaulder to know about.

           He pulls out the AMBER COLORED VIAL retrieved from the well.

                                 CHLOE
                        What is it?

                                 MARBAS
                        A cure...

           Chloe blinks, the Ducati wheel coming to an abrupt stop.

                                 CHLOE
                        For the plague?

                                 MARBAS
                        No...To all Kaulder’s sufferings.  
                        The one thing he wants most. 

           Chloe studies the swirling mixture, realizing its importance 
           as...

           EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

           Kaulder stares down the phalanx of police officers, revolvers 
           leveled, the SOUND OF APPROACHING SIRENS.
                                 OFFICER #1
                             (calling out to Kaulder)
                        Release your weapon and slowly 
                        raise your hands in the air!

           A TENSION BEAT, white-hot spotlight HOVERING, the cops unsure 
           what Kaulder’s going to do -- Then slowly...agonizingly 
           slow... Kaulder starts to comply, carefully releasing his 
           grip on the ‘Purifier’...

           And then...he’s in motion.

           KAULDER

           SPINS...FIRES UPWARD...Shooting out the spotlight...plunging 
           the street back into darkness.

           BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Kaulder PIVOTS, unleashing a fusillade 
           of SUPPRESSING FIRE toward the officers feet, ROLLING across 
           the asphalt!

           With his other hand, he unleashes an EXPLOSIVE BOLT, targeting 
           the strut of a nearby building, the device HUNKERING in.

           BOOOOM!  A BURST OF SUPERNOVA LIGHT from the device splits 
           the darkness, blinding the officers!

           The cops cover their eyes...and when they finally manage to 
           open them again...

           Kaulder’s gone.

           INT. MARKET - SAME TIME

           Marbas remains locked in Chloe’s tight grip.

                                 MARBAS
                             (straining)
                        Think of it.  Kaulder can finally 
                        have the release he’s always 
                        wanted, he can join his family on 
                        the other side...

           He stops, looking to Chloe’s eyes -- Surprised by what he 
           sees there.

                                 MARBAS (CONT’D)
                        You...care for him.

           Chloe doesn’t reply...she doesn’t have to.

                                 MARBAS (CONT’D)
                        Then I guess...you’ll have to make 
                        a choice.
           With a grin, he tosses the vial in the air!

           Time slows...the glass vial WINKING in the light.

           Chloe DIVES, fingers grasping the vial just before it hits 
           the ground...She spins, looking for Marbas but...he’s 
           disappeared.

           Chloe grips the vial as --

           KAULDER 

           Stumbles into the market -- Defeat etched across his eyes.  

                                 KAULDER
                        Belial got away with the Plague 
                        Piece...

           He stops, noticing the vial, sensing Chloe’s reluctance.

                                 KAULDER (CONT’D)
                             (re: the vial)
                        ...What is it?

           A BEAT, Chloe torn -- Hesitating.

                                 CHLOE
                        It came from Marbas...

           She looks to Kaulder, knowing she has no choice but to tell 
           the truth.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        It’s something he pulled from the 
                        Church Well -- He said it’s a cure 
                        ...for you.

           Kaulder stares at the amber liquid, innately understanding -- 
           He snatches it out of Chloe’s hand...

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        Kaulder, wait --

           But he doesn’t.  He opens the vial...putting it under his 
           nose to smell it.  The effect is immediate: A LINE OF CRIMSON 
           BLOOD leaks from his nose, his body consumed with apyrexias. 

           Kaulder manages to shut it.  He stands, holding in his hands 
           the one thing he’s craved all these years...

           Oblivion.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

           A red moon high above the skyline...

                                 BELIAL (O.S.)
                        Tonight’s herald isn’t just a call, 
                        it’s a message...

           EXT. BRONX - SAME TIME

           FIGURES gather in the darkness.  Faces caked in TRIBAL 
           MAKEUP... 

                                 BELIAL (O.S.)
                        For the desperate...

           EXT. QUEENS - SAME TIME

           A TIGHT WAVE OF SLEEK MOTORCYCLES ripple down the street...

                                 BELIAL (O.S.)
                        For the forgotten...

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME TIME

           DARK SHAPES move between the trees.

                                 BELIAL (O.S.)
                        For the battered...

           EXT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY - SAME TIME

           And finally...a STREAM OF FIGURES head into the chalk doorway 
           leading to the Council Chambers...The covens of New York.

                                 BELIAL  (O.S.)
                        For the mad.

           INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           BELIAL 

           Stands amongst the other Council Members, they now wear 
           florid robes according to the ways of the Ancients.  Noble.  
           Timeless.

                                 BELIAL
                        But most of all...It’s for 
                        Witchkind everywhere.

           He kneels before a STONE BATH, revealing the two Plague 
           Pieces soaking in PRIMORDIAL SULPHURIC WATERS -- 
                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        Covens aross the globe will 
                        witness our first strike...Dutch  
                        Toverheks...Spanish Brujas...Hindi 
                        Jadoogarni...the Revenants in the 
                        sands...the Jadis in the mountains 
                        ...all will be called...

           He stares...his ultimate plan revealed.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        And once they see...they will join -- 
                        And the time of our true rising will 
                        begin. 

           THE WATER 

           BOILS with grim intensity...as if the pieces themselves can’t 
           wait for their big moment...Belial PLUNGES his hands into the 
           blistering water...and off his messianic expression we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           TIGHT on Kaulder and Chloe.  Impossible to tell where they 
           are.

                                 CHLOE
                        Are you sure you want to do this?

           Kaulder nods, sure.  Face etched with grim intensity.

           He pulls out his transceiver, places it in his ear.

                                 KAULDER
                             (touching his ear)
                        Travis...we’re coming in.  Both 
                        of us.

                                 TRAVIS (O.S.)
                             (transmitted)
                        Alright.  Initiating system 
                        override...I sure hope you know 
                        what you’re doing.

           We PULL BACK, revealing Kaulder and Chloe are standing in 
           front of...

           THE RELIGIOUS SHOP (CHURCH FACADE)

           The two of them head inside.
           INT. CHURCH CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Kaulder and Chloe race off the elevator and into the stone 
           walls of the Church stronghold -- Travis is waiting, uneasy.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Allowing a witch into Church 
                        sanctuary?  They’ll kick me out of 
                        seminary for this -- 

           Kaulder just blows right past him, the vial gripped tightly 
           in his palm.

                                 KAULDER
                        Where’s Dolan...

           He stops, now seeing the Cardinal at the end of the corridor, 
           waiting -- Kaulder advances, barely able to restrain himself 
           from assaulting his longtime confidant.

                                 KAULDER (CONT’D)
                        All these years.  You KNEW -- And 
                        you never told me...  

                                 DOLAN
                        We’ve all known.  Every overseer 
                        you’ve ever had.
                             (beat)
                        Even Travis.

           Kaulder freezes, his world tilting from its axis -- He shoots 
           the young priest a look.

                                 KAULDER
                        How long?

                                 TRAVIS
                        Centuries.  It was developed by 
                        Pope Benedict himself, a chemical 
                        agent powerful enough to destroy 
                        any enemy.  Human or witch -- But 
                        when the Church realized it could 
                        be used to kill its greatest weapon 
                        ...it decided to lock the formula 
                        away forever.  

           Kaulder reels, SLAMS his fists into the stone wall, as if 
           wanting to destroy the Church itself -- His movements frenetic, 
           emotions building into a firestorm...until finally...

           He stops.
           Kaulder slumps to the floor.  Staggered by the betrayal. 
           Everything he’s believed in...a lie -- In the frigid silence 
           that follows, Dolan steps forward.

                                 DOLAN 
                        I would do it all again if I had to 
                        -- Think of the lives you’ve 
                        saved...hundreds?  Thousands?
                             (beat)
                        Go ahead.  Drink it.  End your 
                        ‘curse’.  You have every right.  
                        But where’s the strength in that?  

                                 TRAVIS
                        Swallow it and you doom not just 
                        yourself...but everyone else.  Are 
                        you willing to make that sacrifice?

           Kaulder stares, eyes locking on the amber liquid. 

                                 KAULDER
                        In a heartbeat.

           Dolan kneels before his charge...now neither Cardinal nor 
           confidant -- But a friend. 

                                 DOLAN
                        I came to you first as a child.  
                        Innocent.  Naive.  Back then, 
                        everything seemed simple.  Good lay 
                        on one side.  Evil on the other.
                             (beat)
                        The vial is the easy way...but its 
                        not the right way.

           HOLD ON KAULDER, Dolan’s words registering as...

           THE CHAMBER RUMBLES 

           Ominous.  Low.  Tiny fissures erupting along the stone 
           walls -- Travis runs over to a BANK OF MONITORS, feverishly 
           crunching data.

                                 TRAVIS
                             (studying the screens)
                        ...Deep level seismics emanating 
                        from Council Chambers, the entire 
                        root structure of the city...it’s 
                        moving. 

                                 DOLAN
                        Belial must be tapping into the 
                        root matrix --
           Chloe stares at the flickering screens, lost.

                                 CHLOE
                        What’s it mean?

                                 KAULDER
                        Belial’s activating the Plague Box.

           A BEAT -- Dolan turns to Kaulder.  Imploring. 

                                 DOLAN
                        We need you Kaulder.  You’re the 
                        last witch hunter.

           A long moment, Kaulder’s expression unreadable...until, 
           finally...he places the vial within the folds of his coat.

                                 KAULDER
                        One last hunt.

           And off his look we CUT TO:

           INT. CHURCH ARMORY - NIGHT

           A reinforced door SLIDING back, light hitting a DAZZLING 
           DISPLAY OF KICK-ASS WITCH WEAPONRY.

           Kaulder looks to Chloe, her eyes wide.

                                 KAULDER
                        Take whatever you want.

           A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS:

           Kaulder strapping on his strongest WITCH ARMOR...

           Chloe secures a series of TWIN-BLADED KNIVES...

           AMMO CARTRIDGES click...

           ROUNDS are loaded...

           And last...but not least -- Travis and Chloe watch as Kaulder 
           approaches the stone wall, snapping open a WROUGHT-IRON 
           PLATE...he punches in a BRASS KEY...

           With a CLICK, a HERMETICALLY SEALED DOOR POPS open...

           INT. HIDDEN CHAMBER - SAME TIME

           Old.  Earthen.  Obviously hasn’t been opened for a long time 
           -- Kaulder stands framed in the doorway...before him lie two 
           pieces of ancient weaponry:
           Kaulder’s sword and shield.  Battle-tested.  Emblems of time.  
           He takes them up.  A bringer of war.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT

           The CAMERA plunges through the canyons of the city, finding 
           two lone figures on a windswept street:

           KAULDER AND CHLOE

           Longcoats rippling behind them, bristling with weapons -- 
           Kaulder’s sword and shield catching light from a sodium-arc.  
           A knight in the wrong era.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Kaulder and Chloe step before a door, Kaulder about to knock 
           ...but before he can -- It opens -- Revealing the Toy Shop 
           Proprietor.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        It’s about time... 

           He stares, obviously drunk, a boozy graybeard with a DARK 
           BOTTLE OF NETTLE WINE in his hand.

           INT. TOY STORE (BACK AREA) - NIGHT

           The Proprietor rummages noisily through stacks of entrancing 
           handmade toys...hunting for something.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        I gave Belial the Gremory Chalk... 
                             (beat)
                        But there are other ways...not that 
                        I’d let Belial know...alchemy’s a 
                        part of my lineage, an all but lost 
                        art...

           And now he stops, looking to our two heroes.  Tired.

                                 PROPRIETOR (CONT’D)
                        To think it would come to this:  A 
                        witch-hunter who knows only to fight 
                        ...and a witch who knows only to run.
                             (to Chloe)
                        If you could stop all this with one  
                        unselfish act, would you, my dear?
                                 CHLOE
                        I...think --
                             (considering)
                        Yes.  I would.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        Why?

           Chloe finds Kaulder’s gaze.

                                 CHLOE
                        I don’t want to die...like I lived.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        Unfortunate...For its not you who 
                        gets to decide.

           He finally finds what he’s looking for, reaching to pull an 
           OBJECT out...A GREY STEEL SPRAY CAN with a WHITE NOZZLE top

                                 PROPRIETOR (CONT’D)
                        I distilled the base elements into 
                        a different form -- Just don’t let 
                        the cops catch you...Vandalism in 
                        this city.  A hefty fine.

           And off the familiar METALLIC RATTLE of a Street Tagger 
           applying his trade we CUT TO:

           EXT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY - NIGHT

           Kaulder and Chloe standing before the massive wall.  The 
           structure impenetrable -- A beat -- Chloe running his hand 
           along the graffittied sigils and seals. 

           Kaulder spray-paints the black outline of a DOORFRAME onto 
           the surface of the wall.  

           For the first time, we see hesitation in Chloe’s eyes... 
           Kaulder presses on the brick, doorway opening as they step 
           inside...

           INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY (STAIRWAY) - CONTINUOUS

           The jagged stairway lies before them, roots and branches 
           entwined into the soil, twisted by eons of roiling rock.

                                 CHLOE
                        After you...

           Kaulder heads down, Chloe following, every step growing 
           increasingly treacherous...  
           INT. CAVERN - NIGHT

           The stair finally bottoms out into a fetid cavern, its 
           surface lined with ancient markings -- Chloe runs her hands 
           over the witchscript, unable to fathom their meaning.  

                                 CHLOE
                        What’s it say?

                                 KAULDER
                        A warning...
                             (reading)
                        ‘The sightless one’...’The 
                        Sentinel’.

           From somewhere in the darkness...a SCUTTLING SOUND -- Chloe 
           spinning to glimpse

           A PALE VISAGE 

           We recognize it as that of the Witch Sentinel -- It looks 
           different, markings and shape now transformed for battle -- 
           More like its ancient brethren.

           The witch recedes back into the darkness, the PROWLING SOUND 
           OF ITS MOVEMENT surrounding them -- Chloe peers into the 
           murk, terrified. 

                                 CHLOE
                        ...You ever go up against something 
                        like this before?

           Kaulder pulls the ‘Purifier’, eyes hunting the darkness.

                                 KAULDER
                        Been a while.

           He fingers the trigger...ready to squeeze off a round when --
           WHAP!  The terrifying form of the Sentinel splits the gloom 
           with a GHASTLY SHRIEK!  

           NAILS CLICK

           The Sentinel LAUNCHING A SPELL, WHIPSAWING through the air 
           toward Chloe!

           Kaulder LEAPS, blocking her with his shield.  The spell 
           bouncing off the protective material, hitting the cavern 
           wall, the surface rotting centuries before our eyes, writhing 
           with MEALY INSECTS AND WORMS.

           Chloe’s a whirlwind, blades SAILING though the air as Kaulder 
           FIRES the ‘Purifier’ in contained bursts.
           The Sentinel HOWLS, nimbly dodging the onslaught, SMASHING 
           atop Kaulder, KNOCKING the gun from his hand, jaws CHATTERING 
           mere inches from his neck!

           CHLOE 

           Sees a fallen object lying on the cavern floor, she SCRAMBLES 
           across the cavern to grab it as --

           THE SENTINEL’S TALONS

           Rake across Kaulder’s armor, lunging in for another attack... 
           but before it can -- 

           A BLACK SPRAY

           Coats its face, the creature SCREECHING!  Kaulder ROLLS, 
           managing to snap up his gun -- BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  He lets 
           loose a BLISTERING FUSILLADE, the sound DEAFENING!

           WITH A FINAL WAIL

           The Sentinel collapses in a heap, liquefying before it even 
           touches the ground. 

           Chloe steps next to Kaulder, hands him back the spray can.

                                 CHLOE
                        Had no idea my ancestors were so 
                        ugly.

           The Sentinel’s nothing more than an ebony slick staining the 
           earth -- Together, they step past the muck...heading deeper 
           into the cavern as we CUT TO:

           INT. RITUAL TEMPLE - NIGHT

           The innermost recesses of the Council Chambers.

           It’s beautiful.  Earthen walls carved from the bowels of the 
           earth, lined with ELABORATE SIGILS and STATUES.

           BELIAL 

           Steps into the vast space, around him the four members of the 
           New Council -- The Afrikaan moves toward him, a RATTLING BOX 
           OF DRIED BONES clutched in his hand.  

                                 AFRIKAAN
                        I’ve rolled the bones...they speak 
                        of an infiltrator in the Sanctum.
                                 BELIAL
                        Kaulder.
                             (beat)
                        It doesn’t matter...he’s too late --

           In his hands, he grips the two seperate halves of the Goetia.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        For every key there’s a locked 
                        door...this one, we open together.

           With much ceremony...he interlocks the two pieces of the 
           Goetia together...and from within the wood --

           AN EERIE CALLIOPE

           The artifact SHUDDERING to life with a SERIES OF CLICKS, 
           revealing SLIDING PANELS OF AGED WOOD and HIDDEN CHAMBERS.  
           It’s alive.  A masterwork of ORGANIC TECHNOLOGY.   

           Belial grins...

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        After over four hundred years, it’s 
                        time to fullfil your destiny...

           He steps forward...and it’s only now we see --

           THE GREAT WOODEN MACHINE

           It looms before Belial, its base already buried in the 
           chamber soil...a SINGLE EMPTY VACANCY in its center -- Belial 
           approaches, SNAPPING the Plague Box into the waiting heart of 
           the machine.

           WOODEN PLUGS

           THRUST from the Box, a GROAN echoing through the chamber as 
           the machine WHIRLS to life...the base begins to CHURN through 
           the dirt, dredging up TANGLES OF ROOTS, weaving them like a 
           giant loom as we CUT TO:

           INT. CAVERN - SAME TIME

           Kaulder stops before a steep crevasse leading to hidden 
           chambers...From below, a DEEP RUMBLING.

           Kaulder and Chloe stare, knowing it can only mean one thing.

                                 CHLOE
                        The Goetia.

           Kaulder unspools a zip-line, anchoring it to the cavern wall, 
           the two of them THREADING down...
           INT. CREVEASSE - CONTINUOUS

           Cool and quick, they make their way down, stop just above a 
           hidden alcove -- Dropping quietly into it. 

           INT. ALCOVE - CONTINUOUS

           KAULDER’S P.O.V.:  Belial’s followers, they are legion, 
           awaiting outside the Temple Chamber for the private ceremony 
           to complete -- Too many different types of witches to track.

           Kaulder senses Chloe’s apprehension.

                                 KAULDER
                        You don’t have to do this.

           Kaulder squeezes her trembling hand.  From anyone else this 
           would be a simple gesture -- But from the witch hunter?  
           Chloe manages a soft smile, relishing his touch.

           The moment holds.

           INT. CHAMBER OUTSIDE ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER

           A TALL WITCH looks over, sees a SMALL BLACK OBJECT roll out 
           from between the elevator doors.  Unnoticed by the others.

           The witch goes to it, picking the object up, it looks like a 
           hockey puck.  He puts it next to his ear, shakes it.

           BOOOOOM!  The GRENADE explodes, unleashing a POWERFUL CLOUD 
           OF SALT and IRON-FRAGMENTED SHARDS!  

           EMERGING FROM THE ALCOVE

           Kaulder opens fire with the ‘Purifier’, SPRAYING the room.  
           The Witches SHRIEK, confusion and chaos everywhere!

           And that’s what our heroes want.

           He WHIPS into the chamber BLASTING, Chloe now clad in SLEEK 
           ARMOR and a pair of PHOSPHOROUS PROTECTIVE GOGGLES tossing 
           THREE MORE GRENADES -- The EXPLOSIONS rip through the chamber 
           like white noise.

           It goes on like this, amidst the carnage and mayhem, our 
           heroes taking down dozens of witches.

           But the good times can’t last forever.

           A PALE FIGURE 

           Looms up from a SHADOW on the floor.  A Landnámabók.  
           Its talons reach, SNATCHING Kaulder...

           Chloe SPINS in time to see him --

           VANISH 

           Into the floor...

           And that’s when things get weird...

           WE’RE IN THE WORLD WITHIN SHADOWS

           Pools of darkness bursting to light...

           And then...only DARKNESS.  Endless.  Stretching forever. 

           A distant figure...growing LARGER...becoming...

           KAULDER 

           PLUNGING through the VOID. 

           Until suddenly...there is no void...only blue sky, the sound 
           of WIND GENTLY BLOWING THROUGH LONG GRASS...

           Kaulder’s eyes FLASH open...finding himself --

           EXT. GRASSY MEADOW - DAY

           Kaulder sits up...sees SOMETHING in the distance.

           A COTTAGE

           His cottage.  He heads for it.

           INT. COTTAGE - DAY

           Kaulder opens the door, steps in.  Finds a PLATE OF COOKED 
           LAMB waiting for him.  It’s perfect.

           Too perfect.

           A SMALL FIGURE now stands famed in the doorway, STREAMS OF 
           SUNLIGHT making it impossible to see who it is.  

                                 FIGURE
                        ...Daddy?

           It’s Elisabeth.  She SQUEALS, running happily to her father, 
           burying her head in his stomach -- Kaulder unable to get a 
           good look at her face.  

                                 KAULDER
                        What is this?
                                 ELISABETH
                        Mommy and I made it for you.  You 
                        can stay here.

           Kaulder looks, now seeing the lamb meat’s infested with 
           MAGGOTS -- Elisabeth quickly pulls him toward the door, 
           excited...he’s still unable to see her face.

                                 ELISABETH (CONT’D)
                        C’mon.  Mommy’s waiting for you...

           And off her PEALS OF LAUGHTER...

           EXT. STREAM - DAY

           Elisabeth guides Kaulder down to a bubbling brook.  

                                 ELISABETH
                        You can stay, daddy.  It’s what you 
                        always wanted. 

           Kaulder look to see --

           ANGELIKA  

           Sunlight shadowing a part of her face -- She looks radiant.  
           Beautiful -- But then she steps forward, revealing half her 
           visage rotted away.

                                 ANGELIKA
                        Isn’t this what you want, my love?

           Kaulder steps back, turning to look at Elisabeth -- White 
           bone sits where his daughter’s mouth should be, a permanent 
           skeleton grin.

                                 KAULDER
                        No...Not like this.

                                 ANGELIKA
                        No?
                             (beat)
                        We’re dead, my love.  How did you 
                        think it would be?

           She looks to him, one eye inert...glassy.

                                 ANGELIKA (CONT’D)
                        Everybody else is scared of dying -- 
                        Not you.  You’re scared to live.

           A long moment, Kaulder staring at her face.  He realizes... 
           it’s true.  He reaches out, slowly drawing his fingers 
           through his daughter’s hair, strands straying to his palm.
           She leans forward, speaking in a whisper.

                                 ELISABETH
                        Don’t be afraid, daddy.  We can 
                        help you.

                                 KAULDER
                        Help me?

                                 ELISABETH
                        Move on.  Escape.  

                                 ANGELIKA
                        The shadow realm’s tricky...Just 
                        remember to swim as hard as you can.

           Puzzling advice.  But Kaulder nods...and now Angelika pulls 
           him close, one last embrace.  Kaulder’s face creases, his eyes 
           wet.  Elisabeth joins in, Kaulder holding them both tight.

                                 KAULDER
                        Goodbye.

           The moment holds, the three of them together like this -- And 
           then...Elisabeth GIGGLES playfully, SPLASHING SUDDEN COLD 
           WATER at Kaulder as --

           EXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT

           Kaulder’s eyes SNAP open, he COUGHS, choking on a BRACKISH 
           LIQUID...he’s swimming in an endless void of black water.  

           But he’s not alone.

           A PALE HAND

           Clamps onto his leg, pulling him under.

           It’s The Landnámabók...Unmasked in its own element, this 
           thing is terrifying.  Rictus-grin.  Pasty flesh.  In its hand 
           a CURVED DAGGER, poison coating the blade.  

           The witch pulls him deeper.

           Frigid liquid fills Kaulder’s lungs, the curved dagger 
           drawing closer, practically brushing his cheek.  This is it.

           KAULDER 

           DIGS his teeth into the Landnámabók wrist, making the witch 
           lose its grip.  

           Acting fast, he snatches the blade from the water, STABBING 
           right into the witch’s chest.
           EBONY BLOOD flows out in a stream and...with an UNDERWATER 
           SCREECH the Landnámabók disappears into the depths.

           Kaulder’s exhausted, armor weighing him down.  He struggles.  
           Feet kicking.  Not getting anywhere.

           With one final desperate surge, he gives it all he’s got, 
           HEAVING upward, lungs ready to burst, until finally...

           He BREAKS the surface!  He swallows a GULP of precious air, 
           now finding himself --

           INT. CHAMBER OUTSIDE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Bobbing on the surface of the very same shadow he was pulled 
           into, its consistency pure liquid!  In our world, only a 
           split-second has passed.

           CHLOE

           Stands right where we last saw her -- She can’t believe it.

                                 CHLOE
                        I’ve got you.

           She pulls him out -- Kaulder FLOPPING onto the floor.  There 
           are no witches present anymore...all killed or fled.

           He looks to her, picking up his sword and shield -- The 
           moment interrupted by a MAD ROAR now coming from the other 
           side of the closed Ritual Temple doors...

                                 KAULDER
                        We’re out of time.

           INT. RITUAL TEMPLE - SAME TIME

           The GREAT CLATTER of the Goetia is DEAFENING -- Belial and 
           the rest of the Council watching as KNOTS OF ROOTS are 
           THREADED through the heart of the machine, Belial having to 
           yell to be heard.

                                 BELIAL
                        It’s working...

           We FOCUS on the wood machine, pulling LIGAMENTS OF ROOTS from 
           the earthen floor as...

           THE CAMERA

           PLUNGES through the soil below, WHIPSAWING across a VAST 
           NETWORK of shoots and tendrils existing under our feet, 
           extending throughout the world...
           BACK TO SCENE 

           Belial stares at the magnificent display before him.  
           Awestruck.

           But his moment to enjoy it passes as...

           WHAM! -- The massive temple doors EXPLODE OPEN revealing...

           KAULDER AND CHLOE

           A BEAT...the chamber holding its breath as...

           Kaulder DIVES one way, Chloe ROLLING the other -- They’re 
           familiar with each others techniques now, able to anticipate 
           their partner’s moves -- Playing off each other...

           KAULDER

           Whips between the three remaining Council Witches -- He 
           STRIKES with his sword, goading them.  

                                 KAULDER
                        Open season, boys.

           Seeing their prey right in front of them, the witches can’t 
           help themselves, launching spells, Kaulder DROPPING at the 
           last second --

           The Council Witches ABSORB their own CONCUSSIVE BLASTS, 
           FLYING against the EARTHEN WALLS!

           CHLOE 

           SPINS, looking for Belial...but all she finds is --

           DÜER

           Standing before her.  Chloe stares, can’t believe it.  Düer’s 
           face a mask of spiteful hate, hand coming up with an ORNATE 
           RITUAL KNIFE, lunging at Chloe...but at the last second --

           KAULDER

           Grabs Düer’s wrist, wresting the knife from her grip!

           Acting fast, he uses the blade to slice a simple cut across 
           Chloe’s arm -- Chloe blinks, the spell broken to reveal 
           Düer’s true form:

           BELIAL
           Kaulder SPINS with the blade, attempting to cut away Belial’s 
           totem twine -- But the witch is too fast, nimbly DARTING 
           away...for the moment. 

           Kaulder turns to Chloe, her eyes wet.  

                                 CHLOE
                        ...I thought it was her.

           Kaulder looks back to Belial...but he’s gone -- The MASSIVE 
           RUMBLE of the wooden machine building behind them.

                                 KAULDER
                        I’ll keep Belial busy...you stop 
                        the Goetia.

                                 CHLOE
                        How?

           WHAM!  Belial SLAMS into Kaulder like a bullet train, the 
           witch-hunter’s body CRASHING into a stone statue, cracked 
           armor and shield absorbing most of the blow.

           Kaulder recovers, knowing if he wants to beat Belial he needs 
           to stay close to the witch, preventing him from launching a 
           spell -- He rises, defiant.  Locks eyes with his nemesis.

           And just like that...it’s on.

           Kaulder LAUNCHES at Belial, the combat erupting mere inches 
           between them, the witch hunter attempting to grab the 
           dangling totem twine.

           Belial’s a whirlwind -- Kaulder using every ounce of training 
           and experience just to keep up -- Guillotine kicks.  Heel 
           thrusts.  Faints.  Blows.  

           A blizzard of moves SWEEPS the two opponents across the 
           chamber and into...

           INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SAME TIME

           The combat now framed in the sprawling branches of the Great 
           Tree -- Belial managing to grip Kaulder, TOSSING him -- 
           Kaulder’s body CRASHING noisily along the length of the 
           Council table.

           Belial grins, fingers brushing the strange totems along his 
           twine -- Preparing to cast.

                                 BELIAL
                        The Council had an impressive array 
                        of craft signatures, things even I 
                        hadn’t seen before...
           His nails CLICK as -- 

           AIR...

           SYRUPS in a SLO-MO BLURRED STREAK toward Kaulder, the witch 
           hunter barely SPRINGING away at the last second as the spell 
           SLAMS into the table!

           BLAM! SHARDS OF ANCIENT WOOD blast OUTWARD in slow-motion 
           all around Kaulder as he moves at normal speed, wood 
           painfully razoring his skin as --

           INT. RITUAL TEMPLE - SAME TIME

           Chloe steps before the LOOMING WOODEN MACHINE.  

           She pulls a dagger, trying to jam it into the CHURNING 
           COMPONENTS but all it does is CHEW the blade up -- WHAP!  A 
           SHARP CHUNK OF METAL spits dangerously past her head as...

           INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SAME TIME

           WHAP!  Kaulder’s HIT with a CONCUSSIVE BLAST to the chest, 
           squeezing the breath from his chest.

           HIS BODY

           SCRAPES across the stone floor toward Belial, seemingly 
           pulled by invisible wires -- Belial clutches him close, 
           talons TEARING armor, Kaulder letting him...as if he wants to 
           be torn to bits.

           Finally, with one last BRUTAL HIT, Kaulder collapses to the 
           floor -- Belial only now understanding his true intentions:

           THE TOTEM TWINE

           Lies in Kaulder’s grip, the ragged string broken, objects 
           SCATTERED in pieces across the floor -- Kaulder’s taken 
           away Belial’s conjuring abilities.

           Belial looms, undaunted.

                                 BELIAL
                        I don’t need magicks to hurt you.

           WHAP!  With a powerful SWIPE, Belial DIGS his talons into 
           Kaulder’s chest, the witch-hunter REELING in pain as... 

           INT. RITUAL CHAMBER - SAME TIME

           CHLOE 
           Studies the innerworkings of the Goetia, the SLIDING PIECES, 
           the SNAPPING COMPONENTS...and all at once she sees it -- A 
           HIDDEN CHAMBER at the heart!

           She pulls her last dagger, gives it a kiss.

           And with that, she JABS the blade into the heart of the 
           machine!  The components LOCK and SHIFT -- A TRIUMPHANT BEAT, 
           Chloe certain her trick worked!

           Until...

           The gears GNASH back to life.

           The machine is unstoppable.

           INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SAME TIME

           BELIAL

           Hungrily PUMMELS Kaulder, the witch-hunter’s face a mess of 
           bruises now -- Victorious, he draws Kaulder’s sword, placing 
           the singular blade to the witch hunter’s neck.

                                 BELIAL
                        I wonder if even an immortal could 
                        survive without his head.
                             (beat)
                        Imagine eternity...broken in two.

           He raises the sword to strike, Kaulder exhausted, helpless to 
           stop him -- But at the last second, a FIGURE rises behind 
           Belial:

           CHLOE 

           She KNOCKS the sword away with a BRUTAL KICK, but Belial 
           grabs her foot, TWISTING it.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        I have something special for you.

           His hand slides hungrily over Chloe’s body, finding what he’s 
           looking for:  Düer’s ring.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        No object has more meaning to you 
                        ...I hold your very soul in my hand.

           Gripping Chloe close, his fingernails CLICK -- BLUE VEINS 
           beginning to blossom across Chloe’s face.  Belial’s draining 
           her.  Chloe CRUMPLES to the stone floor, lifeforce leeching 
           painfully from her body.
                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        You can’t stop the Plague Box...

           He thrusts forward his palms revealing the flesh branded with 
           the TWIN SIGILS of the Goetia.

                                 BELIAL (CONT’D)
                        The box and I are joined...my heart 
                        is its heart.

           At this, Kaulder’s eyes focus.

           He knows what he has to do.

           He reaches into the folds of his coat, a sense of destiny to 
           the moment...using every last ounce of energy, he LAUNCHES up 
           as...

           THE VIAL

           PUNCHES through Belial’s teeth, glass SHATTERING inside his 
           mouth, dark liquid FLOODING his tongue! 

           Belial’s skin BLACKENS, poisoning from the inside, the 
           chemical agent BLISTERING its way through his body!

           A SCREECH

           Unleashes from Belial’s mouth, the sound cutting off as his 
           body SHRIVELS, sickness traveling through him at unprecedented 
           speed, his body becoming nothing more than a DRIED HUSK as --

           INT. RITUAL CHAMBER - SAME TIME

           THE WOODEN MACHINE

           Begins to COLLAPSE IN ON ITSELF, tendrils of roots UNCOILING 
           from its base as the ground gives way, OPENING UP, a QUAKE 
           echoing through the temple! 

           INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SAME TIME

           KAULDER 

           Kneels to a slowly recovering Chloe, an odd stillness taking 
           hold -- Chloe stares at the vial’s broken shards on the 
           ground, knowing what Kaulder just gave up.

           A SOFT NOISE makes her turn.

           It’s the Great Tree.  The branches are TREMBLING, leaves 
           RATTLING in a falling rain-like pattern.
                                 KAULDER
                        We have to get out of here.

           A DEEP RUMBLE 

           Rocks the chamber, the ground giving way!  The Great Tree 
           GROANS, the whole thing DISAPPEARING into a MASSIVE SINKHOLE 
           caused by the destruction of the Plague Box! 

           Stirred by the rumble, the Velveteen Bird drops from the 
           folds of Kaulder’s coat -- The witch hunter watching 
           helplessly as the earth SWALLOWS it along with the Great 
           Tree.  

           Kaulder grabs up his fallen sword.

                                 KAULDER (CONT’D)
                        C’mon...

           He helps Chloe to her feet, battered and bruised, MASSIVE 
           CHUNKS OF EARTH falling from the ceiling behind them, barely 
           making it out in time...

           INT. FRONT CHAMBER AREA - CONTINUOUS

           The ground SHAKES beneath them, Kaulder pulling her into --

           INT. ALCOVE - CONTINUOUS

           Kaulder helps Chloe toward the dangling zip lines, racing up 
           the rope...

           INT. CAVERN - CONTINUOUS

           They climb up the jagged stairway, everything RUMBLING, 
           making it even more difficult...

           EXT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY - MOMENTS LATER/DAWN

           ANGLE on the brick wall...Everything quiet -- WHAM! -- Kaulder 
           and Chloe BURST out the spray-painted doorway, racing away 
           as...

           THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE 

           Collapses behind them, ENGULFED by the earth.

           A RECOVERING BEAT

           Kaulder and Chloe standing across the street, dwarfed by a 
           cloud of debris -- The morning sun casting everything in an 
           ethereal haze.  It’s beautiful.
                                 KAULDER
                        Four-hundred-fifty-seven.

           Chloe looks to him, not understanding....

                                 KAULDER (CONT’D)
                        You wanted to know.
                             (beat)
                        I’m four-hundred-fifty-seven years 
                        old.

           It could be a trick of the light...but Chloe could swear 
           there’s a renewed glimmer in Kaulder’s eyes, a grim spark of 
           life as we hear the SOUND OF APPROACHING SIRENS.

                                 CHLOE
                        Alright, old man.
                             (beat)
                        See if you can keep up.

           And with a final shared look, our heroes head into the 
           netherworlds of the city.  

           Together.

           THE CAMERA PULLS BACK ALONG THE HUDSON...

           Manhattan skyline now spread before us, jumbled structures 
           reaching up to greet the morning sun.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROAD IN THE MIDWEST - DAY

           A rippling field of wheat.

           The stalks frame a lonely roadway -- A SOLITARY STRUCTURE the 
           only sign of man’s hand.  

           INT. BUS DEPOT - DAY

           AN UNSEEN FIGURE feeds coins into a VENDING MACHINE --  
           Styrofoam cup RATTLING down, quickly filling with a brown 
           liquid that could charitably be called coffee.

           A T.V. MONITOR broadcasts the news.
                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                             (transmitted)
                        Updating top stories:  Authorities 
                        in New York are still sifting 
                        through the collapsed remains of 
                        one of the city’s oldest buildings, 
                        believed to be the work of a hidden 
                        sinkhole... 

           The Figure drinks his coffee, watching the monitor, we still 
           don’t see his face.

                             (transmitted)
                        And officers still have no idea as 
                        to the whereabouts of known serial 
                        killer Anthony Marbas.  Marbas 
                        escaped captivity two days ago, 
                        successfully eluding a nationwide 
                        manhunt.

                        In other news...

           The Figure turns, revealing --

           MARBAS

           Clad in TRUCKER HAT and COAT, he blends in nicely -- With a 
           grin, he pulls out the ‘OTHER’ VIAL recovered from the well, 
           the glass containing only a last few dollops of red liquid.

           He opens it, pouring the remaining tincture into his coffee 
           and drinking it down.

                                 COWBOY (O.S.)
                        Hey, mister...

           Marbas turns, a BRAWNY COWBOY eyeballing him from a nearby 
           seat.

                                 COWBOY (CONT’D)
                        -- You mind moving that fat head of 
                        yours?  Other people like to watch 
                        the news too. 

           A TENSE BEAT -- Marbas taking the man in...then, surprisingly, 
           he nods good-naturedly.

                                 MARBAS
                        My apologies.

           He turns to go, hand absently brushing the Cowboy’s shoulder 
           when he passes.
           ANGLE ON MARBAS:

           As he heads toward the door, it’s only now we see he’s 
           actually REMOVED something from the Cowboy’s shoulder:  A 
           single strand of hair.

           He plays with it, entwining the hair between his fingers... 
           until finally...

           He PULLS it into a knot. Tight.

           THE COWBOY

           Suddenly CLUTCHES HIS CHEST, breath CRUSHING from his body.  
           He’s having a heart attack -- A moment of alarm, PEOPLE 
           racing to help, the man crumpling to the depot floor.  

           EXT. BUS DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Marbas exits...and with one last patented Marbas grin...

           FADE OUT
