           The ominous ring tone. The subsequent scramble to answer it. 
           Heavy breathing. When it’s finally answered we fade in to:

           INT. NOAH’S APARTMENT - DAY

           NOAH PALMER (26), shirtless and completely failing at life, 
           is hanging upside down off a crunches bar in his living room 
           doorway. Out of breath. Covered in sweat. Phone to ear. 

                                 NOAH 
                        Hey sis-
                             (pant-pant)
                        Can I call you back tonight?
                             (pant-pant)
                        No, I was not just getting lucky. 
                        Okay, great, talk to you then.

           He tosses the phone onto the floor. He hangs there, upside 
           down, looking into nowhere.

           INT. RANDOM LOS ANGELES OFFICE - DAY

           Cleaned up and in a shirt and tie, Noah sits in a typical Los 
           Angeles reception area with other potential job candidates. 

           An ATTRACTIVE GIRL is trying to fix the broken heel on her 
           shoe. Noah smiles sympathetically.

                                 ATTRACTIVE GIRL
                        You wouldn’t happen to be the man 
                        of my dreams and be carrying glue 
                        or any other adhesive, would you? 

                                 NOAH
                        I left my purple glue stick at home 
                        today. For the first time in 
                        months. 

                                 ATTRACTIVE GIRL
                        Aww man. What might have been. 

           Noah simply smiles awkwardly. Not really sure what to say. 

                                 ATTRACTIVE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        It’s like these things are made to 
                        break. 

                                 NOAH
                        I think that’s in their mission 
                        statement. 
           The heel will not stick. She concedes defeat.

                                 ATTRACTIVE GIRL
                        I’m going to murder someone with 
                        this fucking thing.
                             (to Noah specifically)
                        Probably you. No offense. 

                                 NOAH
                        Oh. Okay.

           Noah stares at her, terrified, and waits for his interview. 

           EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH - EVENING

           Noah sits on the beach, eating Taco Bell and watching the 
           waves as the sun sets. 

           Because he’s unemployed and because he fucking can.

           INT. BAR ONE - NIGHT

           The local dive bar. Noah tries his best not to laugh at his 
           distraught roommate and quickly developing best friend 
           SKYLAR, a gigantic African-American homosexual. 

                                 NOAH
                        You told Kevin you were like... 
                        pumpernickel bread?

           Skylar groans into the table. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Because you are... black and... 
                        full of dense, nutty nutrition?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Fuck. 

                                 NOAH
                        That’s worse than the time you told 
                        that dude you wanted to scale his 
                        Empire State Building like a giant 
                        gorilla. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        That one’s your fault!

                                 NOAH
                        No way!
                                 SKYLAR
                        You love King Kong!

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, I do, but the sexual analogy 
                        of your example is a guaranteed 
                        boner killer. Because Kong gets 
                        murdered and falls to his death. 
                        It’s like you’re asking him to 
                        praying-mantis you. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        I’m sorry I’m not content to be all 
                        celibate and boring like you.

                                 NOAH
                        I forgive you. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Ya know, one day you’ll turn to me 
                        and say, hey, I got lucky last 
                        night and I feel like a man again.

                                 NOAH
                        One day you’ll turn to me and say, 
                        hey, I didn’t refer to my dick as a 
                        disgusting baked good and I feel 
                        like a man again. 

           Skylar sighs, beaten. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Wanna beer?

                                 NOAH
                        Sure.

           Skylar heads to the bar. Noah sits there and again stares off 
           into that sad, empty nowhere... 

           Then it clicks-

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit!

           He pulls out his phone and rushes for the door.

           EXT. BAR ONE - CONTINUOUS

           Noah waits for the phone to pick up- 

                                 MOLLY (PHONE)
                        ...the hell man...
                                 NOAH
                        Molly?

                                 MOLLY (PHONE)
                        Time change dude...

                                 NOAH
                        Shit! I’m sorry! I know you keep 
                        trying to call-

                                 MOLLY (PHONE)
                        No, it’s fine. I just... 
                             (yawns)
                        Haaaaaaaaave-a-jawwwwwb.

                                 NOAH
                        Low blow! Plus I’m sorry!

                                 MOLLY (PHONE)
                        Ditto. And it’s okay. Really. 

           Silence.

                                 NOAH
                        Sooooo... what did you want?

                                 MOLLY (PHONE)
                        I think I’m kiiiiinda still asleep.

                                 NOAH
                        Wake up then!

                                 MOLLY (PHONE)
                        Is it okay if Anna is one of my 
                        bridesmaids?

                                 NOAH
                        Yes! Of course!

           As soon as he finishes saying this, Noah stops moving. 

           Completely. Probably even his insides. He can’t breathe.

                                 MOLLY (PHONE)
                        Really?

                                 NOAH
                        ...Really...

                                 MOLLY (PHONE)
                        Ohhhh, that’s great. I didn’t know 
                        if things were still weird between 
                        you guys and all.
                                 NOAH
                        Nope. Things are... great.

           His eyes are tearing up.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        It’s your wedding Mols. You do what 
                        ya gotta do.

                                 MOLLY (PHONE)
                             (yawns)
                        Thaaaaanks-duuuude. You’re the 
                        best. Okay-sleeping-bye.

           She hangs up. Noah doesn’t lower the phone. 

           Skylar comes outside and instantly grabs Noah’s phone. Checks 
           the last call. Suddenly becomes very worried.

                                 SKYLAR
                        What’s wrong bro?

           Noah doesn’t even turn around to face Skylar.

                                 NOAH
                        Molly wants Anna to be one of her 
                        bridesmaids.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Why the fuck would she want that?

                                 NOAH
                        She’s always been one of her best 
                        friends. I should have seen it 
                        coming. All Cormac McCarthy like...

                                 SKYLAR
                        But again, why the fuck would she 
                        want that?

                                 NOAH
                        Because she doesn’t know.

           He turns dramatically to Skylar.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        She doesn’t know anything.

           Realization dawns.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Oh fuckabees. 

           TITLE ON BLACK:
                                 YOUR BRIDESMAID IS A BITCH

           INT. NOAH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Skylar waits expectantly as Noah pulls a cardboard box 
           covered in duct tape out of his closet. He hands it to Skylar 
           before taking a step back, as if it were radioactive. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        The famous black box of Noah 
                        Palmer. 

                                 NOAH
                        I guess. I dunno. 

           Skylar opens the box, revealing a jumble of random artefacts. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Is there an itinerary for this 
                        shit?

                                 NOAH
                        Not yet, I’ve been-

           Noah realizes that Skylar was being sarcastic. Skylar hangs 
           his head in shame and enters NOAH’S BOX (which hopefully will 
           be the name of my next porno script). 

           First out is A TERRIBLE KNITTED SWEATER. Blue. Robin’s egg 
           blue. The worst kind of blue. Skylar is repulsed. 

           It pains Noah to see it, as everything in The Black Box will.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Ninth grade. The first Christmas 
                        present she gave me. I love that 
                        sweater.

                                 SKYLAR
                        This sweater is an abomination. 
                        It’s practically an X-File. 

           He tosses it on the bed. Intentionally carelessly. Noah 
           hurries to it, folding it neatly. Pathetically.

           Next: A fancy DIAMOND AWARD. Cumberland County Regional 
           District Science Fair Third Place - Seventh Grade. 

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Why’s this in the box? This should 
                        be on top of the television. It’s 
                        probably the nicest thing we have.
                                 NOAH
                        My science project was about how to 
                        develop different types of 8mm film 
                        on a seventh grade budget. She was 
                        my actress.

                                 SKYLAR
                        I thought the sweater was ninth 
                        grade?

                                 NOAH
                        It was. It took me two years to woo 
                        her over. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Hmm.

           The next is a HOMEMADE CHRISTMAS ORNAMENT. “I LOVE YOU” 
           painted in pink.

           Skylar judges this.

                                 NOAH
                        Pre-Christmas. 11th grade.

           Skylar continues judging. He hands it gently to Noah, and 
           returns to the box.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Ah! At last!

           He pulls out a wad of POLAROID PICTURES. 

           And at last, there she is: 

           ANNA. Disappointingly very attractive and very cool looking. 

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        She’s disappointingly very 
                        attractive.

                                 NOAH
                        Yes. Yes she is.

                                 SKYLAR
                        You bitches scissored at least 
                        right?

                                 NOAH
                        Yes. Yes we did. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        That’s something to tell the 
                        grandkids. 
           The pictures show a couple very much in love. Relaxed in it. 
           Various hair styles and college phases come and go. 

           We end with two pictures: The first, graduation day and the 
           combined families of Anna and Noah.

           And the last, Noah asleep shirtless in a bed. Anna, awake, 
           just looking at him and taking the picture. 

           Skylar waves this picture at an agonized Noah.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        This should get burned.

                                 NOAH
                        Someday. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Too fucking right. 

           Skylar continues rooting through the box, pulling up items 
           (Yearbooks. Novels. Mix-CDs. A Commander Pike in Wheelchair 
           from Star Trek (in)action figure.)

           But then, hidden at the bottom, the very bottom, is a BLACK 
           RING BOX.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck.

           Skylar looks at Noah. Kinda heartbroken for him.

           He opens the box. WHOA. It’s a real fucking DIAMOND RING.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. Dude.

           Skylar is speechless. Now completely heartbroken.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Dude. DUDE. 

           Noah shrugs. 

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Why didn’t you return it?

           Noah shrugs again.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry. At least you didn’t 
                        give it to her.
                                 NOAH
                        ...I totally gave it to her.

                                 SKYLAR
                        She said no?

                                 NOAH
                        ...She said yes. 

           Skylar stares at Noah. 

           Beat. 

           Beat. 

           Beat.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Fine, okay, so-

           EXT. HALLOWEEN PARTY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Noah is dressed as a civil war soldier. 

           This is a Noah with CONFIDENCE. A lot of it. 

           He talks to some random friends and sees ANNA, dressed as 
           Edward Scissorhands, across the room.

           They share a lover’s smile.

           He hand-signs to her:

                                 NOAH
                             (subtitle)
                        “You’re my favorite.”

           She looks at him in faux annoyance, raising her useless 
           scissorhands. She yells across the party:

                                 ANNA
                        YOU’RE A DICK. 

           People look at Anna weirdly. She and Noah could give a shit. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Noah walks with Anna in a cute, trick-r-treated out 
           neighborhood. She is slightly tipsy, but in a fun way. 
                                 ANNA
                        I want to bury you alive, then dig 
                        up your corpse and skull fuck you.

                                 NOAH
                        I want to cut you in half 
                        vertically and have a threesome. 

                                 ANNA
                        I want to cut my name into the back 
                        of your eyeballs with my 
                        scissorhands, lick the blood from 
                        the wound and spit it back into 
                        your gaping eye cavities.

           They laugh at their own stupidity. 

           They look like “The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan” album cover. But 
           at night, in costumes and forty years later. So not really. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Where the hell are we, by the way?

                                 NOAH
                        It’s funny you should ask, because 
                        here we are.

                                 ANNA
                        How drily philosophical of you.

           He stops walking.

                                 NOAH
                        I’m one hundred percent serious.

           The house they stand beside, an adorable bungalow, has a For 
           Lease sign in front of it. Noah picks up a baseball bat 
           laying beside the sign.

           Anna’s totally bewildered.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Trick or treat, darling.

           He DEMOLISHES the sign with the bat. She yelps, covering her 
           mouth with her scissorhands. 

           He continues to beat the holy hell out of the sign. When it’s 
           good and dead, he looks at her, smiling. Tosses the bat.

           BEAT.

                                 ANNA
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?!
                                 NOAH
                        Nothin’.

                                 ANNA
                        Why... how’d you even know there’d 
                        be a baseball bat there!?

                                 NOAH
                        I put it there.

                                 ANNA
                        ....what? Why? What?

                                 NOAH
                        You can walk to school from here. I 
                        can bike to the station...

                                 ANNA
                        Seriously! What’s going on!

                                 NOAH
                        It has two bedrooms, central A/C. 
                        Plenty of yard space for dogs, or a 
                        kid, before we need to upgrade.

           She starts tuning in. A smile begins to emerge.

                                 ANNA
                        Stop teasing me.

                                 NOAH
                        We’ll need to paint up the walls a 
                        bit, but I think-

                                 ANNA
                        Shut up!

           He smiles at her, and takes off his civil war hat. Places it 
           over his heart. Kneels before her.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        SHUT THE MOTHERFUCK UP!

                                 NOAH
                        Darling, I love you. Let’s do what 
                        Mary and Joseph did. Without the 
                        kid.

           He puts his hat down, and BLAM! Pulls out the real fucking 
           DIAMOND RING. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Will you marry me?
                                 ANNA
                        I’M WEARING FUCKING SCISSORHANDS 
                        AND I WANNA WEAR MY RING!

           She shakes her hands violently until the scissorhand gloves 
           come off. 

           Noah has barely put the ring on her finger when she tackles 
           him into the lawn.

           She kisses him. Long and oblivious.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        You bet your ass I will.

           He grins, and they kiss again.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - DAY (THE PRESENT)

                                 KEVIN
                        But that doesn’t make any sense.

           KEVIN, Skylar’s maybe-boyfriend, is knee-deep in yet another 
           retelling of this gnarly tale. Skylar and Noah walk with him 
           and his dog PENGUIN up the hill.

           Skylar attempts to be as impressive as possible. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        It does. If you factor “crazy 
                        bitch” into the equation.

                                 KEVIN
                        Was it the house?

                                 SKYLAR
                        She never went inside the house.

                                 KEVIN
                        How much later until she called it 
                        off? I mean, you moved out here 
                        in...

                                 SKYLAR
                        He moved out here in November.

                                 KEVIN
                             (to Noah)
                        Did you get really premature cold 
                        feet?

                                 SKYLAR
                        No, he did not.
                                 KEVIN
                             (to Noah)
                        Did she?

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        In a matter of speaking. 

                                 NOAH
                        I love how totally unnecessary I’ve 
                        become to my own backstory.

                                 KEVIN
                        I give up. What the fuck happened?

           Skylar turns to Noah hopefully. Noah shrugs.

                                 NOAH
                        Go for it.

                                 SKYLAR
                        What happened, Kevin, was this: The 
                        French Fucker happened.

           BLACKNESS 

           A puff of cigarette smoke. A pair of lips (filmed in Black 
           and White), well shaved except the typical French moustache, 
           takes another drag. He talks into the camera.

                                 THE FRENCH FUCKER
                        Vhy hello. I am zee French Fucker. 
                        I was born in Marseilles, ‘ave you 
                        heard of it? Of course you have, 
                        it’s fucking beautiful. And famous. 
                        I can recite French poetry in my 
                        native tongue. Would you like to 
                        hear some? Of course you would, 
                        it’s French poetry recited in 
                        fucking French, it will give all 
                        you gentlemen erections and make 
                        all you beetches pregnant.

           He proceeds to recite a passage of French poetry. In fucking 
           French. When he finishes... 

                                 THE FRENCH FUCKER (CONT’D)
                        I can also play zee gee-tar, and 
                        zee accordion. Would you like to 
                        hear some? Oui? Fuck you, I’ll make 
                        you wait in agony for zee ecstasy 
                        my music provides. I also collect 
                        Bob Dylan memorabilia. Here is a 
                        picture of me and Bubbi.
           He flicks a picture of himself and Dylan, looking extremely 
           chummy in front of the camera.

                                 THE FRENCH FUCKER (CONT’D)
                        No big deal, beetches. It’s just 
                        the greatest songwriter you 
                        American cunts have ever produced. 
                        Thanks for the cultural 
                        contribution. I received my 
                        education is Paree, and also took 
                        classes in India. Have you been 
                        there? No? Vhere’d you go to 
                        university, New Jersey? I applaud 
                        your bravery while spitting on your 
                        uselessness as an individual. 

           He spits. His phlegm hits the ground and turns into coins. 

                                 THE FRENCH FUCKER (CONT’D)
                        Bah. A peasant’s change.

           He tosses the coins towards the camera.

                                 THE FRENCH FUCKER (CONT’D)
                        Get yourself something pretty, 
                        whore. Maybe liposuction, oui? 

           He sighs. Takes another drag.

                                 THE FRENCH FUCKER (CONT’D)
                        So you are by now no doubt curious 
                        as to my relation to Anna, and 
                        Noah, and this pathetic little 
                        story of yours. Vell, allow me to 
                        tell you.

           He leans closer. Waits a beat. Just his lips. Perfect teeth.

                                 THE FRENCH FUCKER (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you. I will make you wait for 
                        that answer.

           He puts his cigarette out on the camera lens, and walks away. 
           He shouts back, bored:

                                 THE FRENCH FUCKER (CONT’D)
                        Yes, you are right, I fucked her, 
                        like I do all beetches. 

           As he leaves, TWO GORGEOUS WOMEN come from either side 
           towards him. He bitch slaps one, then grabs the other’s ass 
           and walks into the darkness. 

           With both.
           INT. SUSHI BAR - NIGHT

           Noah is on a BLIND DATE. She looks like a girl that was 
           homeschooled, then lost her fucking mind during college, and 
           now is a mix of the two. She wears a church-friendly 
           sleeveless dress. Braided hair. Very cute. 

           Her right arm, however, is completely covered in a wide 
           variety of tattoos. The only part of her body that seems to 
           have any.

                                 NOAH
                        I like your tattoos. They’re so... 
                        varied.

                                 BLIND DATE
                        I had people in my group design 
                        them. Like drawings on a cast, 
                        they’re only temporary.

           This doesn’t really make any sense.

                                 NOAH
                        I don’t... think I understand the 
                        analogy.

                                 BLIND DATE
                        I suppose it’s not a very good one.

           She laughs. He laughs. Okay. She has a pretty smile.

                                 BLIND DATE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, my arm just won’t be with 
                        the rest of me.

                                 NOAH
                        I’m... sorry, I think I’m confused 
                        again...

                                 BLIND DATE
                        Have you ever felt like the number 
                        of limbs you have is holding you 
                        back? I’ve wanted to separate from 
                        my right arm ever since I was a 
                        little girl. It’s called Body 
                        Identity Integrity Disorder and 
                        it’s just a matter of time before I 
                        finally lose it. 

           Beat.

                                 NOAH
                        Why do you want to lose your arm?
           She looks at him like he’s an idiot.

                                 BLIND DATE
                        Because it’s not mine, and it’s 
                        holding me back. Haven’t you been 
                        listening?

           Noah eats his sushi quietly, trying to wake up from this 
           nightmare. He doesn’t. He forces himself to press on.

                                 NOAH
                        I once had my appendix taken out.

           INT. NOAH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Noah paces back and forth frantically as Skylar and Kevin try 
           to calm him down.

                                 NOAH
                        That was the worst fucking idea 
                        you’ve ever fucking had! 

                                 SKYLAR
                        No! She was hot!

                                 NOAH
                        She was like a Cronenberg movie 
                        come to life!

                                 SKYLAR
                        You love Cronenberg! 

                                 NOAH
                        Not in my women! No! She wanted to 
                        have her perfectly healthy 
                        functioning right arm amputated! 
                        What the fuck is that! What the 
                        fuck!

           He paces into the kitchen off screen. Kevin tries to help.

                                 KEVIN
                        Listen man, we just thought if 
                        you’d gotten back on the playing 
                        field, you’d be more emotionally 
                        equipped for the wedding.

                                 NOAH (O.S.)
                        Well it didn’t fucking work, did 
                        it!

                                 SKYLAR
                        NOAH! 
           Noah walks back from the kitchen like a child summoned.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        You’ve still got some time. You’ll 
                        be golden, alright?

           Noah has his hand on the wall, tapping it angrily. In a 
           strange pattern.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Bitch, stop morse code fighting me!

           Noah reluctantly stops. Embarrassed. 

                                 NOAH
                        Sorry. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Now look, we’re going to do 
                        everything we can to make you feel 
                        totally prepared for every and any 
                        thing that can happen. Alright?

           Noah reluctantly nods.

           EXT. SKYLAR’S CAR / LAX - MORNING, SOME TIME LATER

                                 NOAH
                        I feel totally unprepared for every 
                        and any thing that can happen.

           Skylar drives Noah to the hell known as LAX.

           Noah already looks like shit.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Reach into the glove compartment.

           He obeys. A CD-R appears magically.

                                 NOAH
                        Ut oh.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Do not play that until you are in 
                        your hooker-car on your way to the 
                        party, alright?

                                 NOAH
                        You made me a mix CD?
                                 SKYLAR
                        Bro. You need all the help you can 
                        get. 

                                 NOAH
                        Maybe I can just say I got swine 
                        flu or whatever the epidemic of the 
                        week is?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Maybe you can not be a pussy?

           Noah nods. A calm resolve.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        You can do this. And you know why?

                                 NOAH
                        No. Not at all.

           Skylar pulls up to departures. Puts his hand on Noah’s 
           shoulder.

                                 SKYLAR
                        You can do this because you’re a 
                        BAMF. You are Neville Fucking 
                        Longbottom.

           Noah nods bravely, like a soldier about to plunge into 
           Normandy. He hugs Skylar.

                                 NOAH
                        Thanks man.

                                 SKYLAR
                        I’m gonna make the dog wear that 
                        sweater while you’re gone.

           Noah smiles, leaves, and God help him, enters LAX in the 
           middle of the summer. 

           MAP OF THE UNITED STATE:

           A red Indiana Jones line goes from Los Angeles to 
           Philadelphia, and then from Philadelphia to Harrisburg.

           Because why the fuck not. 
           INT. HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Noah awaits his luggage at the carousel. An OVERWHELMED 
           MOTHER struggles with a SCREAMING BABY and an overly curious 
           THREE YEAR OLD.

                                 OVERWHELMED MOTHER
                        SARAH! Sarah Jean!

           The three year old makes a run for it.

                                 NOAH
                        I can hold him if you want, while 
                        you lasso that one. 

                                 OVERWHELMED MOTHER
                        God bless you. 

           She thrusts the baby into Noah and embarks on her motherly 
           quest.

           Noah pats the screaming baby over his shoulder.

                                 NOAH
                        Hey, no! It’s going to be okay! 

           The baby promptly VOMITS down the back of his jacket. 

           Noah continues to pat the baby, completely clueless as to how 
           to solve this new problem at this moment. 

           INT. HERTZ RENT A CAR - DAY

           Noah waits in the rent-a-car-wait-for-fucking-ever-even-
           though-it’s-Harrisburg-and-you-pre-ordered-line. 

           A janitor walks by with her cart, and he swiftly steals a 
           trash bag. He throws his jacket and shirt in it and, now 
           shirtless, begins rummaging through his bag for an 
           alternative.

                                 HERTZ RENTAL BITCH
                        Sir! You’re going to need to put 
                        your shirt back on.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh I will. This baby barf-

                                 HERTZ RENTAL BITCH
                        Sir, I don’t need a story, I need a 
                        shirt.

           Noah pulls out a shirt and smiling with hate, puts it on. 
           INT. VOLVO - DAY

           While driving, Noah puts in the mix CD. Skylar’s voice comes 
           on.

                                 SKYLAR (CD)
                        These are the ten best “screw you, 
                        dyke” songs of all time. I hope you 
                        survive this weekend. Most of all, 
                        I just hope you don’t fuck her. 
                        Because she, my friend, is the 
                        Sauron of bitches, and you can do 
                        better.

           Despite not really believing this, Noah smiles.

                                 SKYLAR  (CD) (CONT’D)
                        Alright, track one. Call me if you 
                        need me, prick.

           “Silver Springs” by Stevie Nicks begins to play.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh for the love of God. 

           He continues driving, not sure if this is awesome or 
           terrifying. 

           He gives in. Rolls down the windows. Sings with Stevie.

           ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF HARRISBURG.

           We follow the Volvo and Stevie through the city. 

           Welcome to Harrisburg, motherfuckers. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Noah turns off into a simple American neighborhood that is 
           already way too packed with cars.

           When he finally parks, he kills the radio.

           Sits there. Deep breaths.

                                 NOAH
                        I am Neville Longbottom. I am 
                        Captain Jean-Luc Picard. I am a 
                        strong, confident man. 
           EXT. HOME - DAY

                                 NOAH
                        I am so fucked. 

           Noah stands behind a shitty black Buick. It has hipster 
           vegany bumper stickers. 

           The look on his face says it all:

           This is her fucking car, and she is in this fucking house. 

           He stares at it in terror. Takes the deciding step forward.

           INT. HOME - DAY

           He lets himself in. It’s a zoo in here. 

           He walks cautiously, like a freshly deflowered girl in a 
           horror film. 

           She could be around any corner. Behind any of the billions of 
           people seemingly crammed in here. 

           He speaks to one of them-

                                 NOAH
                        Hey, do you know where Molly is?

                                 IDIOT
                        Who?

                                 NOAH
                        Nevermind, thanks.

           The search continues-

           INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Noah turns down a hallway full of women-

           For a brief moment, they ALL look like they might be Anna.

           They look at him. Smile.

           He looks at them. Tries to smile. Just looks creepy. 

           Pushes past quickly. 
           INT. KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Noah pseudo-shoves his way into the crowded kitchen. No sign 
           of Molly. No sign of Anna. 

           But the intensity of the crowd nearly does in our poor 
           claustrophobic hero. He breathes in and screams:

                                 NOAH
                        MOLLLLLLLLYYYYYY!

           The whole room shuts up and stares at him. 

           And then, from a different, far off room-

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        WHAT!

           With everyone looking at him, it’s harder to yell. But yell 
           he must.

                                 NOAH
                        I-IT’S NOAAAH!

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        NOAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

           The crowd suddenly part for MOLLY, Noah’s striking and 
           excited younger sister, the bride-to-be in question. 

           Noah grins and meets her halfway with a ginormous hug.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh God, I’m glad to see you.

                                 MOLLY
                        Me too. 

           She looks at him, sister-worried.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        You look awful.

                                 NOAH
                        Long flight. Baby puked on me. Rent-
                        a-car. Harrisblagh. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t know why you didn’t let us 
                        just pick you up.

           She begins leading him through the house. Holds his hand. You 
           better believes he holds on tight. 
                                 NOAH
                        Where’s Dad?

                                 MOLLY
                        He said he had an errand to run. 
                        You know him and crowds. 

                                 NOAH
                        I don’t know like, any of the 
                        people here. 

                                 MOLLY
                        They’re mostly Mark’s people. 

                                 NOAH
                        Huh. Mark’s got people.

                                 MOLLY
                        Yep.

           She leads him into-

           INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

           The fireplace/tv room. A large group of people lounge about 
           on couches, drinking beers, conversing and watching the tube.

                                 MOLLY
                        MARK!

           A man shoots up from the couch. The groom-to-be. MARK. 

           He looks entirely like Mark Wahlberg. 

                                 MARK
                        NOAH!

                                 NOAH
                             (less excited)
                        Marky Mark!

           Mark bearhugs him, and IT HAPPENS. 

           Over Mark’s shoulder, sitting on the floor, is ANNA, with The 
           French Fucker, whose legal name is FELIX TREZEGUET. 

           She sees him. She smiles softly. Signs to him:

                                 ANNA
                        (What up.)

           All Noah can do is raise his hand in a weak wave.
                                 MARK
                        How’s the big L-A?

           Noah is breathless. Eventually recovers.

                                 NOAH
                        ...a-a-awesome. It’s awesome. 

                                 MARK
                        Hey Brad! Get my man a drank!

                                 BRAD (O.S.)
                        Whaddoeshewant?

                                 MARK
                        Whaddaya want?

                                 NOAH
                        Absinthe.

                                 MARK
                        Something strong!

                                 BRAD (O.S.)
                        I’m already friends with him!

                                 MARK
                        Sit, good sir!

           He leads him to their couch. Noah looks at Molly for help, 
           who shrugs at him uselessly. 

           And so they sit. Within blatant ear shot of Anna and Felix. 

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        So’d ya get a job? Molly was saying 
                        it’s just brutal out there.

                                 NOAH
                        Yyyyes. I did get a job though. 
                        Right before I left. 

                                 MARK
                        Aw effing-right you did!
                             (off Noah’s quizzical 
                              look)
                        Not allowed to swear. Grandparents 
                        abound. 

           He points to an old woman randomly sitting on a couch between 
           two dudes, watching TV. 

                                 NOAH
                        Good call.
                                 MARK
                        So what’s this job?

           Noah searches for Molly: gone. Tries not to look at Anna: 
           Fails. 

                                 NOAH
                        It’s um... working on a music 
                        documentary. Fleetwood Mac. 

                                 MARK
                        You are shhhhhh-ing me!

                                 NOAH
                        No, naw, like, starting as soon as 
                        I get back. 

           Mark leans in, quietly.

                                 MARK
                        I effing love Fleetwood Mac. Both 
                        Stevie and Lyndsey would be on my 
                        five. And Molly knows. 

                                 NOAH
                        That’s... great.

                                 MARK
                        Man, I’m so stoked for you! Molly’s 
                        been worried about you since you 
                        moved out there and broke up with 
                        what’s-her-name.

           Noah sneakily points towards Anna. Mark sees this. 

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Ah. Eff. 

                                 NOAH
                        I’ve been... realllllly good 
                        though. Going to a lot of concerts. 
                        Movies. Dates. With women.

           A glass of scotch and a handshake arrives from BRAD, Mark’s 
           Best Man. 

                                 BRAD
                        I’m Brad, Mark’s brother. And here 
                        is a scotch.

           He looks nothing like a Wahlberg.
                                 NOAH
                        Wow, I’m Noah, Molly’s you. Thank 
                        you. You look nothing like I would 
                        have expected.

           He sits beside Mark. If your little sister had to get married 
           before you, you’d hope she at least would marry into a family 
           as seemingly cool and chill as these guys.

                                 BRAD
                        I get that a lot. I’m the beauty, 
                        he’s the beast. 

                                 MARK
                        That’s fine, since I’m marrying 
                        that sexy lady-

           He stands up and points to the recently returned Molly-

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Everyone! I’m marrying that sexy 
                        lady!

           The room cheers! Anna and Felix cheer! Molly shrugs.

           Noah destroys his scotch like it’s a juicebox. Tries not to 
           look at Anna.

           Fails again. 

           Eye contact.

           She smiles.

           He dies. 

           INT. MOLLY’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Noah enters Molly’s bathroom, throws on the sink and quickly 
           splashes water on his face. 

           Multiple times.

           When it doesn’t seem to help, he simply tries to submerge his 
           whole head underwater. 

           After a beat, he re-emerges. Lightly towels his face.

           When the towel drops, he sees the mirror for the first time.

           CONGRATS MOLS! is written on it in lipstick. PICTURES are 
           tacked all along the edges.
           There’s one of Molly, Anna and Noah. Looks like years ago. 

           Noah stares at it for a long moment.

                                 NOAH
                        Fuck you.

           He walks away. 

           Then suddenly returns, and goes for it.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you for stealing nine fucking 
                        years of my life! If those really 
                        were the best years of my life then 
                        I’m going to fucking murder you in 
                        the afterlife! But thankfully, 
                        you’ll probably be going to hell. 
                        And fuck you for thinking Train has 
                        great lyrics. And fuck you for 
                        thinking Crash was a good movie. I 
                        wish you’d go Sandra Bullock 
                        yourself down a flight of stairs. 

           (We SEE scenes illustrating everything Noah attacks from here 
           on out.)

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Fuck your fucking hair and the way 
                        you chew on it when you’re thinking 
                        really hard. Fuck you for working 
                        at a special needs pre-school and 
                        for how fucking hard it is for 
                        anyone alive to understand how I 
                        could hate you since you’re career 
                        makes you a fucking saint. Fuck you 
                        for the five million, four hundred 
                        seventy six thousand and twenty 
                        three kisses I fucking wasted on 
                        you! You know what would have been 
                        a better use of my time and lips? 
                        EVERYTHING. Fuck you for dragging 
                        me to every goddamn piece of shit 
                        musical they put on in this fucking 
                        town. Newsflash: regional theatre 
                        only exists so fucking failures can 
                        give themselves a fucking 
                        reacharound. And fuck you for 
                        convincing me that plaid shorts 
                        were cool! Seriously! Why not dress 
                        me up in jorts and send me to 
                        Jersey! Fuck you for not liking my

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)

                        fucking vegan and judging me every 
                        time I ordered a fucking piece of 
                        meat. Guess what? Meat is fucking 
                        delicious and cow’s don’t have a 
                        fucking clue what’s going on EVER.

                        Seriously. What the fuck, man. Fuck 
                        you for everything. 
                             (beat)
                        And fuck me. 

           He shakes the water from his hair and leaves. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           He opens the door and comes face to face with FELIX.

                                 FELIX
                        Why are you wet?

                                 NOAH
                        I, um, fuck, why are you French?

           Felix laughs. Noah does not.
                                 FELIX
                        I think there are simple answers to 
                        both our queries. May I?

           He motions to get into the bathroom. Noah instinctively moves 
           aside and lets him. The door closes.

           Some RANDOM-ASS GUY has seen the whole exchange. 

                                 NOAH
                        It would’ve been way cooler if I 
                        just closed the door in his face 
                        slowly, right?

           The guy simply nods.

           INT. NOAH’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Noah enters his bedroom-

           And finds A MID-TWENTIES GIRL laying on his bed. She turns to 
           him. She’s fucking GORGEOUS. Curly black hair.

           Noah is instantly nervous. His hair still dripping wet. 

                                 NOAH
                        Hey. You know that moment when you 
                        realize your home isn’t really your 
                        home anymore? This is that moment.

                                 GIRL
                             (laughs)
                        Wow. What a devastating first thing 
                        to say to someone.

           Noah smiles and looks around his old room: it’s small, with 
           music posters covering the walls. He sits in a desk chair as 
           the girl sits up.

                                 GIRL (CONT’D)
                        So this was your room when you were 
                        young and innocent?

                                 NOAH
                        Yep.

                                 GIRL
                        I like your taste in music.

                                 NOAH
                        It’s pretty stellar, isn’t it. 
                                 GIRL
                        Aye. Why are you soaked?

           Noah groans and dries his head with the blanket on the bed. 

                                 NOAH
                        I tried to drown myself in a sink 
                        and failed. 

                                 GIRL
                        You should really try a tub, at the 
                        very least.

                                 NOAH
                        Our neighbors have a pool. 

                                 GIRL
                        I could hold you down.

                                 NOAH
                        You could hold me down in a sink.

                                 GIRL
                        Wanna go?

                                 NOAH
                             (laughs)
                        Don’t tempt me. 

           She outstretches her hand.

                                 GIRL
                        I’m Kelli.

                                 NOAH
                        Noah. Molly’s brother. 

                                 KELLI
                        Mark’s first girlfriend in second 
                        grade before he broke my heart. 

                                 NOAH
                        What he do?

                                 KELLI
                        Fucked our teacher.

                                 NOAH
                        I need to shake his hand again, 
                        clearly. 

           She hops off the bed. Stretches.
                                 KELLI
                        I’m jet lagged as all get out. 
                        Sorry for stealing your bed, cap’n. 

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, no, don’t worry about it. You 
                        don’t have to-

                                 KELLI
                        Avoid water, okay?

           She slaps him on the shoulder and leaves him there. He sees 
           her impression on the bed, and laughs to himself. 

           He sighs and locks the door. Falls on the bed face down.

           First contact: survived. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Noah is still asleep while his DAD, an awesome dude with an 
           awesome moustache who doesn’t give a fuck about pretty much 
           anything but his kids, draws a brontosaurus on his face with 
           a sharpie. 

           Noah slowly comes to. The man doesn’t stop. 

           They make eye contact. 

                                 NOAH
                        Please tell me it’s not a cock.

                                 DAD
                        It’s a dinosaur.

                                 NOAH
                        Perfect. You picked my lock.

                                 DAD
                        Your sister’s rehearsal is in 
                        thirty minutes.

                                 NOAH
                        Perrrrrrrfect. 

           The man keeps drawing. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        You look good Dad.
                                 DAD
                        You look good too. With a dinosaur. 

           Close up on Noah’s face, and dinosaur...

           INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           Close up on Noah’s face:

                                 NOAH
                        You want me to stand here?

                                 VOICE
                        Yes.

           There’s still some sharpie dinosaur left on his face.

                                 NOAH
                        Right here. In this exact spot. 

                                 VOICE
                        Yes. Is that a problem?

           Reveal: Noah is standing BESIDE Anna in the wedding 
           procession.

           She looks at him with a tinge of amusement.

           Noah answers the PASTOR:

                                 NOAH
                        No. No problem. 

                                 PASTOR
                        Great! Hold tight for just one 
                        second guys-

           He scoots off and talks to Mark at the altar. Anna seizes the 
           moment-

                                 ANNA
                        Is standing beside me really so 
                        terrible?

                                 NOAH
                        You want to know the only thing 
                        better than that loaded gun of a 
                        question?

                                 ANNA
                        What?
                                 NOAH
                        An actual loaded gun. 

           Anna laughs. The kind of laugh one laughs when they know 
           they’re in a fight but don’t want to admit it just yet. 

                                 ANNA
                        So Fleetwood Mac, huh?

                                 NOAH
                        Huh.

                                 ANNA
                        Were you maybe lying?

                                 NOAH
                        Why would I do that?

                                 ANNA
                        I could always tell when you were 
                        lying.

                                 NOAH
                        Which is bizarre, because I never 
                        lied to you. 

                                 ANNA
                        False.

                                 NOAH
                        Truth.

                                 ANNA
                        You told me you read Eat Pray Love 
                        when I gave it to you but when I 
                        quizzed you it turned out you 
                        didn’t get passed the second 
                        chapter.

                                 NOAH
                        That’s not a lie. That’s a man 
                        preserving the integrity of his 
                        dick. 

                                 ANNA
                        I think Jesus would call it a lie.

                                 NOAH
                        I think Jesus would understand and 
                        then call your kettle black.

                                 ANNA
                        What’s on your face?
                                 NOAH
                        A giant cock. 

                                 ANNA
                        So then. Why don’t you tell me 
                        about the real Los Angeles?

                                 NOAH
                        Why don’t you tell me how your 
                        folks are doing?

                                 ANNA 
                        What was the cross-country drive 
                        like?

                                 NOAH
                        How’re the preschoolers?

                                 ANNA
                        See any celebrities?

                                 NOAH
                        Did Sara get into a good school? 

           Anna smiles, despite herself.

                                 ANNA
                        No fair. Northwestern.

                                 NOAH
                        You’re shitting me! That’s 
                        fantastic!

                                 ANNA
                        You should have known that already. 

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, but, you’re right... I have a 
                        list of people I need to call at 
                        some point.

                                 ANNA
                        Am I on that list?

                                 NOAH
                        No, yeah, no. Probably not.

                                 ANNA
                        I tried calling you a couple times. 
                        But your number changed. Randomly, 
                        I’m sure.
                                 NOAH
                        I signed up for this lottery for 
                        phone numbers ending in 666 and 
                        sure enough, just a few days after 
                        I got to California-

                                 ANNA
                        You got the antichrist-number!

                                 NOAH
                        I did! Highlight of my life. 

           She smiles. He pretends to. 

                                 ANNA
                        It makes it hard for people to talk 
                        to you when you don’t tell them how 
                        to reach you. 

           Noah shrugs. Stammers. 

                                 NOAH
                        I guess, I just, I dunno. Maybe.

                                 ANNA
                             (laughs)
                        You’re like Woody Allen, all 
                        stammers and awkwardness.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, well, you’re like... Jaws, 
                        man. You’ve scared the shit out of 
                        me so bad I’m terrified of every 
                        drop of water I see-

                                 PASTOR
                        Okay, great, you guys all ready?

                                 NOAH
                        YES! 

                                 PASTOR
                        That’s the spirit!

           Noah marches eagerly ahead with the wedding party to the 
           front of the church. 

           He does not look at Anna again, so help him God.

           INT. ALTAR - DAY

           Noah stands in place like a statue as everyone rehearses. 
           Literally. Like a fucking statue. 
           There is no sound. There is nothing. Just survival, standing 
           eight feet away from her. 

           INT. O’MALLEY STEAKHOUSE AND BAR - NIGHT

           The rehearsal party. Informal enough. Noah sits at a table 
           with Mark, Molly, his father and MARK’S PARENTS (who you or I 
           could care less about).

           Directly across from Noah’s eyesight, after a table or two, 
           is naturally Anna and Felix. Very much a couple.

                                 DAD
                        So. Fleetwood Mac.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah. That’s a lie. 

           Noah’s Dad laughs. Picks the food on his plate.

                                 DAD
                        Need money?

                                 NOAH
                        ...yes.

                                 DAD
                        I’ll give you twenty bucks to do a 
                        speech thing so I don’t have to 
                        talk in front of all these people.

           Noah smiles, the unspoken “sure thing Dad”. He stands up, 
           tapping his glass with a fork.

                                 MOLLY
                        What are you doing?

                                 NOAH
                        I’m speechifying you guys. 

           Other glasses ring out the endorsement, and all eyes are on 
           Noah. Including you-know-who’s.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Hi, uh, everyone, I’m Noah Palmer, 
                        Molly’s big brother-

           Polite applause.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, uh, everyone for coming on 
                        out. I’m really excited to get all 
                        of the gifts Molly gets two of. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                             (har-har laughs)
                        Uh, I just thought I might say a 
                        few words. Mark has been kind 
                        enough to let me be a groomsmen 
                        tomorrow, and naturally Molly’s 
                        sister Carly will be performing 
                        maid-of-honor duties-

           He claps, and everyone follows, for CARLY, Molly and Noah’s 
           half sister. Family drama. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I thought I’d just say something 
                        tonight because, first of all, 
                        Dad’s pretty wasted-

           Laughter. Dad stands up with his glass, downs it. Cheers.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        And secondly, Molly has been one of 
                        my best friends for literally most 
                        of my life. She’s been the 
                        responsible little sister that got 
                        me out of trouble and I guess it 
                        makes sense that she’d be the first 
                        of us to get married off.

           Molly smiles, blows him a kiss. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know Mark too well, but 
                        from I can tell, he’s an overly 
                        attractive guy that looks like he 
                        works out all the time but really, 
                        the trick is, he just eats burgers 
                        and drinks beer and BAM! Rock hard. 
                             (laughter)
                        I remember, Mark, when I met you, 
                        when you shook my hand I thought 
                        you were gonna break it. I had 
                        planned on being the tough older 
                        brother but you diminished me in 
                        less than half a second with a 
                        handshake.
                             (laughter)
                        But it’s all good. I think you 
                        might genuinely be a good guy, and 
                        a good guy is all I want for my 
                        little sister, so-
                             (raises glass)
                        To Molly and Mark!

                                 EVERYONE
                        To Molly and Mark!
           Everyone toasts, and Noah takes his seat. 

                                 MOLLY
                        That was sweet No’.

                                 DAD
                        Also short. Thanks.

           Before Noah can respond, there’s another ding-ding-ding of a 
           glass, and all eyes turn over to Anna, now standing. Now 
           toasting.

                                 NOAH
                        Son of a bitch...

                                 ANNA
                        Hi everyone, my name is Anna 
                        Cliver, I’m one of Molly’s 
                        bridesmaids tomorrow, wooo!

           The crowd cheers and woos with her. Noah drinks.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Noah already did a pretty good 
                        exposition job with his speech, so 
                        I’ll skip that. But I’ll never 
                        forget the first time I met Molly-

           Molly covers her head in shame-

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        That’s right Molly, I still haven’t 
                        forgiven you. It was kindergarten, 
                        a few years back, and us youngin’s 
                        were playing hide and go seek, and 
                        I was hiding, Molly was seeking. 
                        And I was under the wooden jungle 
                        gym fort thingy, and I guess there 
                        had been some antagonism between us 
                        kindergartners previously, because 
                        when Molly found me, instead of 
                        saying “found you” or something 
                        like that, she kicked me full force 
                        in the nose. 

           The wedding party reacts with laughing gasps. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Blood gushing everywhere, all over 
                        my clothes, I’m running around 
                        screaming, bloods going all over 
                        her clothes, like a Japanese horror 
                        film-
           She breaks down laughing, as is everyone. She then becomes 
           teary eyed. Felix offers her a supporting hand. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        And I knew then that I’d be her 
                        bridesmaid.

           More laughter.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Rest assured Mark, you ever cross 
                        her, she’ll beat the shit out of 
                        you. Although knowing you, you’d 
                        probably love that.

           Even more laughter. Mark, slightly drunk, agrees. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                             (raises glass)
                        To my beautiful Molly, whom I have 
                        loved growing up with, and look 
                        forward to growing older beside.

                                 EVERYONE
                        To Molly!

           Molly gets up and rushes over to Anna. The two girls embrace, 
           doing their girl thing.

           Noah grinds his teeth.

           INT. BAR - LATER

           Noah approaches the bar-

                                 NOAH
                        I want something lethal man.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Coming right up.

           The Bartender heads off. Noah looks down the bar and sees 
           Kelli smiling back at him. 

                                 KELLI
                        Lethal, huh.

                                 NOAH
                        You have no idea.

           The Bartender returns with a shot. Attention to Kelli.
                                 KELLI
                        Why not the same.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Yes ma’am.

           Noah eyes the shot glass.

                                 NOAH
                        What do you think it is?

                                 KELLI
                        Gasoline.

                                 NOAH
                        Sweet. I’ll wait for you. 

                                 KELLI
                        What a gentleman.

           The bartender hands Kelli a similar shotglass. She raises it.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        To suicide.

           They tap shotglasses and down them. And nearly die.

                                 NOAH
                        Ohmygod-

                                 KELLI
                        Holyfuck-

           They laugh and cough. She slaps him on the shoulder.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        As you were, cap’n.

           And slides away again. He watches her go. Soon becoming lost 
           in thought, and her walk, which is totally aweso-

                                 FELIX
                        Bonjour.

           Noah slowly turns to find Felix sitting beside him.

                                 NOAH
                        Hey.

                                 FELIX
                        Hello.

                                 NOAH
                        Bonjour.
           Felix grins, drinks from his glass of wine.

           He really is an attractive little fucko.

                                 FELIX
                        So how are you, man?

           We realize almost instantly that Felix has almost NO FRENCH 
           ACCENT.

                                 NOAH
                        I’m doing what I do best, Kate. 
                        Survivin’.

                                 FELIX
                        I hear you.

           They both drink. And Noah is honest.

                                 NOAH
                        ...How is she?

                                 FELIX
                        She’s good. She’s happy.

                                 NOAH
                        ...Good.

                                 FELIX
                        Ya mean that?

                                 NOAH
                        Sometimes. I dunno. By the way. I 
                        hope you die.

           Felix laughs and the men drink again. They look across the 
           bar and see Anna. She is STUNNING.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I barely recognize her.

                                 FELIX
                        Shorter hair suits her.

                                 NOAH
                        Barely. 

                                 FELIX
                        But it works, right.

                                 NOAH
                             (less conviction)
                        Barely. 
           She looks at them. Waves. Noah looks at his drink. Felix 
           waves back.

           She walks over. Sits beside Felix.

                                 ANNA
                             (to bartender)
                        A zinfandel.

                                 FELIX
                        My tab. 
                             (re: Noah)
                        His too. 

                                 NOAH
                        Mine’s on Jack Palmer’s tab. Keep 
                        it there please. 

           He obliges.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Why the fuck isn’t this an open bar 
                        anyway...

           Anna begins taping on the bar. Noah listens.

           We realize it’s MORSE CODE.

                                 ANNA
                             (subtitled)
                        U O-K?

           Noah smiles bitterly, shakes his head and taps back:

                                 NOAH
                        Oh come on...
                             (morse)
                        P-L-E-A-S-E S-T-O-P.

                                 FELIX
                        I was in LA for a few weeks when I 
                        was younger. Really loved it there. 
                        What do you think?

                                 ANNA
                        W-E-L-L?

                                 NOAH
                             (grinds his teeth)
                        Yeah, it’s great. 
                             (morse)
                        F-U-C-K O-F-F.

           She begins replying, as she gets her drink.
                                 ANNA
                             (to bartender)
                        Thank you.
                             (morse)
                        E-A-S-Y N-O.

                                 NOAH
                        S-T-O-P I-T.

                                 FELIX
                        Are you guys Morseing?

                                 ANNA
                        Yes baby.

           Noah visibly reacts to “baby”. Anna visibly reacts to his 
           reaction.

           She’s hurting.

           Felix listens as Noah taps on the bar. He stares straight 
           ahead. Into HELL.

                                 NOAH
                        She knows if she morses to me I 
                        have to answer.
                             (morse)
                        P-L-E-A-S-E L-E-A-V-E.

                                 FELIX
                        Why?

                                 NOAH
                        Because for some God-forsaken 
                        reason I’m intensely OCD about 
                        morse code.

                                 ANNA
                             (morse)
                        D-O Y-O-U H-A-T-E M-E.

                                 FELIX
                        You learned it for Chett? 

                                 NOAH
                        Well. Duh. 

           Anna looks genuinely distraught. 

           But before she can say or morse anything else-

                                 KELLI
                        Hey, you ready?
           Noah, Felix and Anna look up at Kelli, who stands expectantly 
           for Noah.

                                 NOAH
                        What?

                                 KELLI
                             (annoyed)
                        You ready to go?
                             (to Anna, all smiles)
                        Hi, I’m Kelli!

                                 ANNA
                        Anna.

                                 FELIX
                        Felix. 

                                 KELLI
                        Aw, I’ve heard sooooo much about 
                        you guys.

           An awkward pause. The women smile at each other, unsure why.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        So let’s go dude. I’m tired as 
                        shit. 

                                 NOAH
                        Yes’m.

           Noah leaves the bar, without so much as a glance to Anna. 

                                 KELLI
                        So nice meeting you!

           Kelli follows him out. Anna remains at the bar. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Kelli leaves the bar, and searches the parking lot for Noah. 

                                 KELLI
                        Dude?

           From across the parking lot, she sees a hand shoot up from 
           behind a car. Confused, she heads towards it...

           She finds Noah, doubled over, fingers pressed tightly to his 
           eyes, trying his best not to sob.

           Failing spectacularly.
                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no no no. Heyyyy. It’s okay.

           She scoots down on the ground beside him.

           She doesn’t say anything. She doesn’t touch him. She just 
           sits beside him as he cries his heart out. 

           After a while-

                                 NOAH
                        I love you so much right now, by 
                        the way.

                                 KELLI
                        I know. I was pretty stellar.

           Noah smiles. Tries drying his eyes. 

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        Walk me home?

                                 NOAH
                        In like... three minutes.

                                 KELLI
                        That’s cool.

           They sit there, on the pavement between the cars.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Kelli and Noah walk through Harrisburg, along the coast of 
           the Susquehanna River. 

           Across the River is CITY ISLAND, the youth hot spot of 
           Harrisburg. The barlights light up the river peacefully.

                                 KELLI
                        He was my first kiss.

                                 NOAH
                        No way! Seriously?

                                 KELLI
                        Yeah, and then he went and kissed 
                        Susie Brennans. The tramp.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh nos! Does my sister know about 
                        this?
                                 KELLI
                        You’re damn right she does. I wrote 
                        her a letter warning her. 

           INSERT: 

           Kelli’s letter, written like a second grader, warning her of 
           marrying Mark. 

           EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

                                 KELLI
                        So I hadn’t seen him since 
                        elementary school, and then we 
                        wound up in the same college, 
                        became friends, then online 
                        friends, then he said he was 
                        getting married in H-Burg, and I 
                        said, oh wow, I’m working in Philly 
                        the Thursday before, I can swing 
                        this. And alas, here I am.

                                 NOAH
                        What do you do?

                                 KELLI
                        I work in insurance sales for large 
                        businesses. 

                                 NOAH
                        Wow. That sounds incredibly boring. 

                                 KELLI
                        And what’s your job?

                                 NOAH
                        I write epic novels about the human 
                        condition in Russian.

                                 KELLI
                        Oh! You’re unemployed!

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, life’s a bitch. 

                                 KELLI
                        That it is. And lo, speaking of 
                        bitches...

           She trails off. Noah sighs and carries on.
                                 NOAH
                        And lo. She left me. For Francois 
                        Truffuck. 

                                 KELLI
                        I’m sorry. What happened?

                                 NOAH
                        She found greener pastures.

                                 KELLI
                        Like... literally or figuratively?

                                 NOAH
                        Like... we were engaged and went to 
                        a movie and afterwards at dinner 
                        she started crying and told me she 
                        slept with someone else and... he 
                        had greener pastures. 

                                 KELLI
                        Wow. Fuck. So how the hell is she 
                        in your sister’s wedding?

           Noah looks at her. It is all the exposition she needs.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        Oh, that’s bullshit! Why the fuck 
                        didn’t you tell anyone?

                                 NOAH
                        I dunno. It just seemed... gross. 
                        Like, she’s part of the family at 
                        this point you know? Her and Molly 
                        were friends forever, and then more 
                        so when we dated. I mean, she took 
                        my Dad to Spring Awakening for his 
                        birthday one year. 

                                 KELLI
                        You’re kidding me. 

                                 NOAH
                        There’s nudity on stage. He didn’t 
                        believe it was a real thing.

                                 KELLI
                        She get him those seats on stage?

                                 NOAH
                        Of course.
                                 KELLI
                        Of course. Still, I think your 
                        nobility is misguided.

           Noah laughs.

                                 NOAH
                        Well, if I said something now I’d 
                        just be a whiny bitch.

                                 KELLI
                        You’re crying in parking lots dude. 

                                 NOAH
                        I am crying in parking lots, aren’t 
                        I. 

                                 KELLI
                        Yep. 

                                 NOAH
                        Fuck.

                                 KELLI
                        Do you remember what it was like 
                        before you were just a whiny bitch?

           Noah tries to remember:

           BEFORE-NOAH-WAS-A-WHINY-BITCH MONTAGE

           In about 10 seconds, we see a dense montage of Noah with 
           Anna: making out, having sex, eating dinner, sleeping, at the 
           movies, paintball, playing with dogs.

           The entire montage is SHOWN IN 3-D. Since the audience will 
           not have 3-D glasses, it’s gonna look pretty fucking weird. 
           Afterall:

           EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

                                 KELLI
                        3-D sucks. 

           Noah laughs. 

                                 NOAH
                        But you know what I mean.

           Kelli pushes her lips together. 
           Across the river, fireworks erupt after a minor league 
           baseball game ends. They explode in the sky and fade away.

                                 KELLI
                        Oh, wow.

           Noah looks at them, then at her, as they reflect in the 
           water. Smiles to himself.  

           INT. CROWNE PLAZA HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           They are about three pints into it. Not drunk, but having a 
           grand old time. 

                                 KELLI
                        So New Orleans, to Atlanta, to 
                        Miami, to Fort Laud-

                                 NOAH
                        Oh my gosh, stop it. I’m gonna have 
                        a panic attack just listening to 
                        this.

                                 KELLI
                        Never France though. Your girl, is 
                        she like, a Francophile or 
                        something?

                                 NOAH
                        I dunno. I think she just might’ve 
                        been a bit of a twat. 

           They clang their pints together. 

                                 KELLI
                        But really, how’d that all go down?

                                 NOAH
                        I don’t know. I don’t care.

           He drinks quietly. Notices THE BURN SCAR from a removed 
           tattoo on her ring finger. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        You have a burn scar on your 
                        finger.

                                 KELLI
                        Yep.

                                 NOAH
                        So how’d that all go down?
                                 KELLI
                        Wrote my name on a piece of paper.

           Noah laughs and kills the rest of his pint.

                                 NOAH
                        It’s like you have a real life.

                                 KELLI
                        What?

                                 NOAH
                        Like... I keep feeling like I’m 
                        waiting for my life to begin, and 
                        people all around me my age are, ya 
                        know, married with houses and jobs 
                        that pay six figures and it’s like 
                        they’re alive. Miserable, 
                        sometimes, I know, but alive. I 
                        feel like I’m cryogenically frozen 
                        as this lost quarterlife shit 
                        that’s angry at everything all the 
                        time. 

                                 KELLI
                        I wish I could be cryogenically 
                        frozen.

                                 NOAH
                        Emotionally or physically?

                                 KELLI
                        Both? I mean, when you really think 
                        about it, in a hundred years, we’ll 
                        probably be more artificial than 
                        human. 

                                 NOAH
                             (sighs)
                        That sounds so good.

                                 KELLI
                        I know. And drug development will 
                        probably be at the point where you 
                        take a pill when you’re feeling a 
                        little blue, and it picks you right 
                        up to the perfect level. 

                                 NOAH
                        Time travel.

                                 KELLI
                        Fucking time travel dude. Dinosaurs 
                        and Jesuses. 
                                 NOAH
                        Go back in time and fix all your 
                        mistakes.

                                 KELLI
                        My mistakes?

                                 NOAH
                        No, like, ye all mistakes. 

                                 KELLI
                        Right. Well you know they haven’t 
                        invented time travel yet, because 
                        they haven’t visited us or 
                        anything.

                                 NOAH
                        Or what if they have, and we’re 
                        just on the course corrected 
                        timeline? Like, I was supposed to 
                        get fucked in the ass figuratively 
                        by Anna because if we had gotten 
                        married something... else would 
                        have happened. Like maybe all our 
                        kids would have been violently 
                        murdered by CyberManson, and so 
                        someone went back in time and had 
                        that relationship fail so neither 
                        of us would have to deal with that 
                        agony. 

           Beat.

                                 KELLI
                        You’ve actually thought about this 
                        before, haven’t you.

                                 NOAH
                        Every day. 

                                 KELLI
                        Wouldn’t it be smarter just to go 
                        back and destroy CyberManson?

                                 NOAH
                        I get stuck on time travel plot 
                        holes a lot. 

                                 KELLI
                        Ah. Happens to the best of us.

                                 NOAH
                        It-
           Noah stops, and looks at the hotel entrance.

           FELIX AND ANNA walk arm in arm through the lobby to an 
           elevator. They get in. Totally oblivious that they are being 
           watched.

           Kelli watches the elevator doors close and bursts into 
           laughter.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                             (smile)
                        What?

                                 KELLI
                        Nothing!

                                 NOAH
                        Tell me! 

                                 KELLI
                        It’s so wrong!

                                 NOAH
                        What!

                                 KELLI
                        Dude. Your ex-fiance’s about to get 
                        fucked in the ass. Literally not 
                        figuratively.

           Noah stares at her, momentarily shocked. And then bursts into 
           laughter as well. 

                                 NOAH
                        Wow. I so hope that’s true. I hope 
                        it fucking hurts. 

           They keep laughing. More than a little ridiculous now.

           She finishes her pint, turns to him.

                                 KELLI
                        I have a job, and a minibar. 

           Noah tries his best not to hide his surprise.

           He fails admirably. 

                                 NOAH
                        I want both. 
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Noah and Kelli are sitting on the bed, tiny bottles in hand. 

           They are drrrrrrrrrrunk.

                                 NOAH
                        So you’re really divorced?

                                 KELLI
                        Yeah. Why the “really”?

                                 NOAH
                        I dunno. You seem... really young 
                        to be divorced?

                                 KELLI
                        That’s entirely because I am really 
                        young to be divorced. I don’t want 
                        to speak out-of-turn, considering 
                        I’m not that much older than your 
                        bride-to-be sister, but getting 
                        hitched young was an awful fucking 
                        choice. Ya know that tribe in 
                        Africa, they put those rings around 
                        their necks every year as they 
                        grow, until they have super long 
                        necks, and how if they ever removed 
                        all the rings their necks would 
                        just snap? That is exactly what 
                        getting married young is like. 
                        Unnatural and neck-breaking. 

                                 NOAH
                             (laughs)
                        That’s a great analogy. 

                                 KELLI
                        Thank you. I’ve gotten a lot of 
                        mileage out of it, trust me. 

                                 NOAH
                        How long ago?

                                 KELLI
                        Not long enough.

                                 NOAH
                        Long enough for what?

                                 KELLI
                        To want to get married again.
                                 NOAH
                        Sometimes I feel like one serious 
                        girlfriend’s all I got in me for a 
                        lifetime. I can’t imagine multiple 
                        marriages. Most married couples I 
                        know are though.

                                 KELLI
                        Ohmygosh, I know. I’m gonna be one 
                        of those women.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah if this was the fifties, you’d 
                        be a massive bruised apple.

                                 KELLI
                        I’d be a fucking harlot is what I’d 
                        be. So you only had the one serious 
                        girlfriend?

                                 NOAH
                        I like how you switched topics 
                        using the connector “fucking 
                        harlot”. I “dated” girls before, in 
                        like, Jr. High. None as long or 
                        as... epic. Obviously.

                                 KELLI
                        We dated for three collegiate 
                        years. He was my entire college 
                        experience. I didn’t even have a 
                        cliched lesbian hook-up.

           She lays down, and puts her hand on his foot. He blushes, and 
           puts his hand on her foot. 

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        You have hobbit feet.

                                 NOAH
                        You thankfully do not. I’m amazed 
                        you’re touching mine.

                                 KELLI
                        Dude I’ve been married. All my 
                        girly gross-outs have graduated far 
                        beyond feet. 

           She moves her left foot and shows him it’s sole, where a four 
           inch scar runs through it.

                                 NOAH
                        Whoa the fuck is this!
                                 KELLI
                        When I was nine, I was running 
                        outside in flip flops, which make 
                        it particularly hard to explore in 
                        the forest with, so I ditched them 
                        and moments later, naturally, I 
                        spiked a broken beer bottle through 
                        my foot.

           Noah is reduced to a squirming mess of a man. 

                                 NOAH
                        Oh! No! Fucccccccccck-

                                 KELLI
                        Eighteen stitches, bitch. I’ve 
                        wanted to get it tattooed up. How 
                        hard would that make me?

                                 NOAH
                        Really fucking hard. And psychotic. 
                        I went on a blind date with a girl 
                        that had tattoos on her arm, but 
                        she wanted to have her arm chopped 
                        off because it was holding her 
                        back.

           Kelli has no words for this. Lays back on the bed. 

                                 KELLI
                        Signs and wonders. 

           Noah runs his finger along the scar. 

           Without really thinking about it, he KISSES it gently and 
           quickly. 

           Kelli smiles, nearly blushes, and quickly tries to pretend it 
           didn’t happen. 

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        I got this one-

           She curls away from him and pulls down the back of her shirt, 
           revealing her bare shoulder blade, save for her bra strap and 
           a tattoo of what looks like a child’s drawing of a spaceman.
                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        My six year old nephew drew that 
                        when we were at the beach last year 
                        with markers, and when my sister 
                        took a picture of it and showed me, 
                        I just headed straight down to the 
                        gnarliest tattoo parlor in south 
                        Jersey, got it inked in.

                                 NOAH
                        Awesome. Congrats on now having 
                        AIDS, by the way.

                                 KELLI
                        Thanks! And I got this one.

           She rolls on her back, hikes up her shirt to show her 
           ribcage, where latin scrawl is etched fantastically close to 
           her breast. Which neither we nor Noah see (perverts). 

                                 NOAH
                        Ah, the typical latin scrawl-

                                 KELLI
                        Italian. This is a real quote 
                        written in Eye-talian from “Orlando 
                        Furioso”, which happens to be my 
                        favorite book.

                                 NOAH
                        “Orlando Furioso” is a total of no 
                        one’s favorite book.

                        “Nature made him, and then broke 
                        the mould.” I, of course, in 
                        complete disregard to the original 
                        text, changed it to the feminine.

                                 NOAH
                        I still don’t believe it’s your 
                        favorite book.

                                 KELLI
                        I don’t give a shit what you 
                        believe, I’ve got a tattoo on my 
                        ribcage and that’s all I need. 
                        Snob.

                                 NOAH
                        No, I mean, I do like it. I 
                        especially like where you put it.

                        I just don’t think I could ever get 
                        a quote tattoo, as intellectually 
                        genuine and undeniable sexy as 
                        yours seems to be.

                                 KELLI
                        Why thank you, and why not?

                                 NOAH
                        I’d just be afraid I’d sound 
                        liiiiiiike a pretentious little 
                        shit. 

                                 KELLI
                        That’s probably because you would 
                        be, but if you can’t lord something 
                        over the many peons out there, what 
                        can you do? Got any tattoos?

                                 NOAH
                        No, not yet.

                                 KELLI
                        Got any scars?

           Something turns in Noah. He considers his reply. Answers 
           honestly.

                                 NOAH
                        Some.

                                 KELLI
                        Where! How!

           Suddenly, he’s that awkward guy again. Quiet, and when he 
           tries to start, only stammers come out. 

                                 NOAH
                        Hm, well, I guess, uh, after, um. 
                        After Anna left me, there was 
                        like... a two or three week period 
                        where she wasn’t quite with Felix 
                        and wasn’t quite finished with me. 
                        And even though she’d fucked him 
                        she didn’t, she like, didn’t know 
                        what she wanted? And I don’t think 
                        he ever really knew about me before 
                        hand, or to what context he did or 
                        not, actually none of that matters, 
                        fuck ‘em.  

           Noah clears his throat. Prepares himself.
                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I dunno, I guess I was too 
                        shell-shocked to really make a 
                        stand because I mean literally one 
                        day the rest of my life is 
                        relatively planned out and the next 
                        it’s all gone. And we’d fight and 
                        she’d tell me what I needed to do 
                        to keep her or some shit. And of 
                        course they got ugly and nasty and 
                        never ending, and... she told me 
                        she started to, like, cut herself 
                        to release the pain or whatever. 
                        And that was fucking awful just in 
                        words but then she’d just send 
                        like, pic texts of these like, 
                        super thin cut lines like... 
                        shooting stars that she said she 
                        put on her stomach because of me, 
                        or Felix, or the situation. And the 
                        texts never had any words it would 
                        just be the pictures. And one day I 
                        just... fucking lost it and grabbed 
                        a pair of scissors and tore up my 
                        thigh real bad. I took a picture of 
                        it and I was going to send it when 
                        I kind of, I dunno, beamed back 
                        into my body and... I said fuck it 
                        and by the end of the week I was 
                        sleeping in my car next to the 
                        beach in Santa Monica. It was just 
                        too much and I don’t, I didn’t know 
                        what the fuck else to do.

           He fiddles with his feet, refusing to make eye contact. 

                                 KELLI
                        And they scarred?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah. I mean, nothing crazy or 
                        anything, but... I’ve got her on me 
                        now. 

           They are quiet. He collapses backwards.

                                 KELLI
                        Can I see it?

                                 NOAH
                        No. Not really. 

           She lays her head beside his thigh, and lightly runs her 
           fingers on it. 
           And then she softly kisses it.

           It is either one of the greatest or most painful moments of 
           Noah’s life. 

           He sits up and lays down on the bed beside her. They spoon. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for saving me tonight.

                                 KELLI
                        If I hadn’t, what might have 
                        happened?

                                 NOAH
                        I either would have hit her or 
                        fucked her. 
                             (sincerely)
                        Maybe both.

                                 KELLI
                        I know exactly what you mean.

           She wraps his arm around her.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        If you want to just use each other 
                        tonight, we can do that.

                                 NOAH
                        Okay. But not really, no. This has 
                        kind’ve been a great night, I don’t 
                        want to fuck it up.

           She reaches and turns out the light.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        And I kinda might like you.

           In the dark, a tiny smile.

                                 KELLI
                        Have I told you how much I hate my 
                        left leg?

           They laugh, and cozy up closer. 

           Goodnight.

           EST. HARRISBURG - MORNING

           The sunrise over the Susquehanna River. Swoon.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Noah is getting dressed when Kelli awakes. She rolls over to 
           him, sleepy-eyed.

                                 KELLI
                        Ah, the old spoon and split.

                                 NOAH
                        I wasn’t going to spoon and split. 
                        I swear. 

                                 KELLI
                        Whatever. We’re only going to the 
                        same day-long event. 

           She smiles. Uber. Babe.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        Your sister’s getting married 
                        today. My first boyfriend’s getting 
                        married today. 

                                 NOAH
                        That’s insane. I feel old and 
                        withered, like a less powerful and 
                        more lame Baba Yaga. I also feel 
                        moderately hung over.

                                 KELLI
                             (groans)
                        Me too. Where’s your suit?

                                 NOAH
                        In my car. At the bar. 

                                 KELLI
                        Go get it. I’ll wake up when you 
                        get back.

           She rolls over. He grins and heads out the door.

           EXT. STREETS OF HARRISBURG - MORNING

           Noah walks through the sleepy streets. 

           It’s a good morning.

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - MORNING

           Kelli, still in the clothes she fell asleep in, straightens 
           Noah’s tie. He looks fucking good.
                                 KELLI
                        You look fucking good.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah?

                                 KELLI
                        Mhmm. 

           He checks himself out in the mirror. 

                                 NOAH
                        Cool.

           He takes a deep breath, and heads out to the room-

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 NOAH
                        Alrighty. I’m off to brave the day 
                        and not kill myself. 

           She salutes him.

                                 KELLI
                        Good luck, Captain.

           He salutes her back.

                                 NOAH
                        When will I see you over there?

                                 KELLI
                        Miss me already?

           He smiles, doesn’t answer. He turns to open the door.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        Hey Noah.

           He turns-

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah-

           And SHE KISSES HIM.

           It’s THE kiss. The one that wins MTV Best Kiss Awards because 
           it turned on so many teens that approximately five thousand 
           babies were born as a result (and twice as many abortions 
           had).

           When it ends, Noah is, rightfully, speechless.
                                 KELLI
                        Go get ‘em.

           She heads into the bathroom. She takes off her shirt, 
           exposing her bare and tattooed back, and kicks the door shut 
           behind her.

           Noah stands there, completely still.

           The bathroom door locks.

           He explodes into the biggest grin imaginable, and heads out-

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kelli leans against the sink as she hears Noah leave. 

           Stares into nowhere.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Down the hallway, full of all the confidence in the world. 

           EXT. CHURCH - MORNING

           Noah trots up the steps to the church, and swings open the 
           big doors-

           INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           And walks right in front of Anna kissing Felix. 

           Not making out or anything crazy. 

           But still. Kissing. 

           His buzz comes crashing down HARD.

           They see him. The most awkward stand off in the history of 
           cinema. 

                                 NOAH
                        So. Is Molly here yet?

                                 ANNA
                        Yes-

                                 NOAH
                        Then you’re being a shitty 
                        bridesmaid, aren’t you.
           Noah walks past them briskly, up a flight of stairs.

           INT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM - MORNING

           Noah bursts into the Sunday School room, rubbing his arms 
           frantically. Gasping for breath. He grabs his phone and 
           dials. Answers-

                                 NOAH
                             (sing-song)
                        Panic attack!

                                 SKYLAR (PHONE)
                        ...did you fuck her...

                                 NOAH
                        No, hi, I slept with someone else 
                        last night.

           INT. SKYLAR’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A previously sleeping Skylar bolts up in bed. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Seriously?

           INT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM/SKYLAR’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 NOAH
                        Not... sexually. But she did kiss 
                        me.

                                 SKYLAR
                        That’s what I’m talking about son! 
                        Yes! Yes!

                                 NOAH
                        I feel awful.

                                 SKYLAR
                        No! No! 

                                 NOAH
                        No, not about kissing her. That was 
                        fucking awesome.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Then what’s wrong?
                                 NOAH
                        I’m just a fucking mess and I’m 
                        tired of it. This chick has 
                        “Orlando Furioso” tattooed right 
                        under her boob. But I mean, so 
                        what, we... We could date for nine 
                        years and get married and have kids 
                        and own a mortgage and she... she 
                        could still just up and leave me 
                        for anyone, particularly of the 
                        French hipster persuasion. And I 
                        would trade all nine fucking years 
                        for one fucking day where I don’t 
                        think about all the ways where I 
                        fucking suck at fucking life.

                                 SKYLAR
                        ...What the hell is “Orlando 
                        Furioso”?

                                 NOAH
                        It’s this Italian classic. It’s 
                        cool.

           The two friends are quiet, coast-to-coast.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Shit, did I wake you up?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Mhmm.

                                 NOAH
                        I keep forgetting about time 
                        change.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Mhmm.

                                 NOAH
                        I don’t wanna care, I just wanna 
                        take massive amounts of expensive 
                        anti-depressants, work and sleep 
                        and hang out and forget everything 
                        about that fucking bitch so I can 
                        stop being a whiny bitch- 

           There is a knock at the door. It quietly opens, and Anna is 
           standing there. She waves silently. 

           Noah stares at her blankly.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        So I gotta go right now.
                                 SKYLAR
                        What? Why?

                                 NOAH
                        Worst case scenario. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Don’t yo-

           He hangs up the phone. She closes the door quietly. Another 
           awkward pause that Noah Baumbach would have an orgasm over.

                                 ANNA
                        You look really handsome Noah.

           She looks fucking amazing. 

                                 NOAH
                        You look really... thin.

                                 ANNA
                        Thanks.

           Another pause, as she checks out the room. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Did we ever... do it in here?

                                 NOAH
                        ...We never did it in a church.

                                 ANNA
                        We totally did.

                                 NOAH
                        Especially not in a Sunday School 
                        room.

           She pulls up another plastic toy chair.

                                 ANNA
                        Like... multiple times...

                                 NOAH
                        What do you want, Anna?

           She shrugs.

                                 ANNA
                        Did you mean it? 
                                 NOAH
                        I’m not sure what you’re 
                        specifically referring to, but the 
                        answer is probably yes. 

                                 ANNA
                        What you just said. About 
                        forgetting everything.

                                 NOAH
                        Were you eavesdropping?

                                 ANNA
                        No way! I heard what you said 
                        telepathically. 

                                 NOAH
                        That’s still eavesdropping-

                                 ANA
                        More like mind dropping-

                                 NOAH
                        And yeah, I meant it. I’d Eternal 
                        Sunshine you in a heartbeat.

           She nods. Ouch.

                                 ANNA
                        Nine years is a long time.

                                 NOAH
                        Not long enough.

                                 ANNA
                        Fuck man! These conversations just 
                        go in circles, with you finding 
                        clever ways to twist what I say 
                        into statements about how much of a 
                        bitch I am.

                                 NOAH
                        I never start the conversations.

                                 ANNA
                        You never end them either.

                                 NOAH
                        How the fuck do I end this 
                        conversation, Anna? Please, tell 
                        me, because I would love to put a 
                        period at the end of this godawful 
                        novel. 
                                 ANNA
                        It’s just, I mean, you moved across 
                        the country from me, all of a 
                        sudden, like you were raptured-

                                 NOAH
                        Because I was running away from 
                        you!

                                 ANNA
                        Well, don’t!

                                 NOAH
                        What? How does that make sense?

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t know Noah! I-I-I don’t, I 
                        mean, who knows what might’ve-

                                 NOAH
                        Don’t you fucking dare-

                                 ANNA
                        Noooooo, Noah, I’m not saying that-

                                 NOAH
                        What are you saying-

                                 ANNA
                        I DON’T KNOW! WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU 
                        WANT?

                                 NOAH
                        I WANT YOU BACK OR I WANT YOU TO 
                        DIE!

           She’s laughs, though she finds nothing particularly funny.

                                 ANNA
                        Ouch? And you wouldn’t take me 
                        back.

                                 NOAH
                        I’d be miserable if you died too. 
                        It’s a lose-lose-lose situation.

           They’re quiet again.

                                 ANNA
                        I’m glad you wouldn’t... throw a 
                        parade if I perished.
                                 NOAH
                        Well, part of me probably would. 
                        But nine years is a really long 
                        time.

                                 ANNA
                        How would you do it?

                                 NOAH
                        Upside-down crucifixion. 

                                 ANNA
                        Like Peter. 

                                 NOAH
                        Bingo.

                                 ANNA
                        Eh. Could do better. Sarlac Pit.

                                 NOAH
                        Ooooh. Yeah. That’s a good one. 
                        Maybe just throw the whole cross 
                        in. 

           They come close to smiling at each. They used to really work. 

                                 ANNA
                        Look, I know... I fucked up. But I 
                        love him Noah.

           Noah stares at her. Daring her to look away.

                                 NOAH
                        Did you love him when you fucked 
                        him? 

                                 ANNA
                        No. But I do now. 

           Noah clears his throat. 

                                 NOAH
                        I still have no idea why you did 
                        it.

                                 ANNA
                        It was just what was supposed to 
                        happen. I wish it didn’t, not like 
                        that, but it did. And I’m sorry for 
                        hurting your heart.

           Noah keeps staring at her, waiting for her to look him in the 
           eye. She does eventually, briefly, and looks away.
                                 NOAH
                        That’s why these conversations 
                        never end. Because you pull that 
                        stupid “destiny and fate are fuck 
                        buddies” card. And you don’t love 
                        him, you just love having a reason 
                        to justify your whoring into a 
                        legitimate relationship. 

           She remains quiet, watching him.

           He gets up. The child’s chair sticks to him, and he punches 
           it away. It crashes into toys loudly.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I love things too, ya know. 

                                 ANNA
                        I know-

                                 NOAH
                        I happen to love Los Angeles, and I 
                        love David Cronenberg movies, and I 
                        love St. Vincent.

                                 ANNA
                        I know-

                                 NOAH
                        And I love going to museums and Bob 
                        Baker’s Marionette Theatre and I 
                        love King Kong and I love... 
                             (thinks about it)
                        Minibars and hotel rooms... and I 
                        love... fucking... Netflix...

           Noah’s breathing becomes rapid. He rubs his arms together 
           tightly.

           She stands up too. Her chair doesn’t stick. Of course.

                                 ANNA
                        It’s okay-

                                 NOAH
                        It’s not fucking okay. I’m a real 
                        catch. I-I-I treat women right and 
                        I open the doors for them and I 
                        make great mix-tapes with singers 
                        they’ve never heard before and I 
                        always stand on the outside when 
                        we’re walking on the street in case 
                        a drunk driver jumps the curb-
                                 ANNA
                        No one knows this more than me-

                                 NOAH
                        That’s the fucking point, you bit-

           Even now, he can’t bring himself to say it to her face. 

           But she knows. Takes another step towards him.

           He cringes.

           They are either about to get into a fist fight. Or fuck.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        That’s exactly the point.

           Noah leaves as fast as he can. 

           INT. CHURCH HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Noah, shell-shocked and shit-slapped, hurries down the stairs 
           and through the crowded church lobby. 

           Kelli watches him. He charges through the crowd with his head 
           down, not seeing anyone or wanting to be seen. 

           She turns her attention back the way he came, and sees Anna 
           descend the stairs. She heads the opposite way, to the ladies 
           room. 

           Kelli look around the room, and sees Noah’s Dad looking at 
           her. He’s seen the whole thing too.

           He shrugs sadly, and she responds in kind. 

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Anna is reapplying her make-up when Kelli walks in. She 
           reapplies her lipstick.

                                 ANNA
                        Noah’s friend, right? Kelli?

                                 KELLI
                        Oh, hi there! Anna, right?

                                 ANNA
                        Yeah, look, if you’re gonna... let 
                        me have it or something... just go 
                        for it.
                                 KELLI
                        I’m not gonna let you have it.

                                 ANNA
                        Thanks.

                                 KELLI
                        I mean, no offense, but if 
                        everything he told me is true, 
                        which I imagine it is, you deserve 
                        what you get. But not from me. I’ve 
                        been that girl at a bar destroying 
                        a boy that loves her so. 

                                 ANNA
                        How’d that work out for you?

                                 KELLI
                        Probably not as well as it seems to 
                        be working out for you. 

           She finishes up.

                                 ANNA
                        Are you seeing him? I mean. Is he 
                        alright? 

                                 KELLI
                        I only met him yesterday. 

           She closes up her purse and walks out.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        But he’s one helluva kisser. 

           Anna watches her go.

           INT. MARK’S BACKSTAGE ROOM - MORNING

           Noah sits beside Mark as they wait for everything to get 
           started. Mark taps his foot anxiously, while Noah looks off 
           into nowhere.

                                 MARK
                        You good bro?

                                 NOAH
                        Are you good?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah. I keep being paranoid that 
                        something terrible’s going to 
                        happen. 
                                 NOAH
                        Don’t be.

                                 MARK
                             (laughs)
                        I wish I could just click and obey.

                                 NOAH
                        I know exactly what you mean. But 
                        it’s all gonna be okay. You’ll see. 
                        Trust me.

                                 MARK
                        She’s here right?

                                 NOAH
                        Oh yeah. She’s psyched out of her 
                        mind. 

                                 MARK
                        Yeah?

                                 NOAH
                        Absolutely. 

                                 MARK
                        Good. Okay. Good.
                             (beat)
                        I think I’m going to be a kick-ass 
                        husband Noah. 

                                 NOAH
                        You better be.

           They laugh. Noah puts his hand on Mark’s back. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure you will. Why do you think 
                        so?

                                 MARK
                        Because what could be better than 
                        her?

           Noah is quiet for a moment, before looking up at Mark.

                                 NOAH
                        That’s literally the best thing 
                        I’ve ever heard. 

                                 MARK
                        Do you wanna hear my vows?
                                 NOAH
                        Eff yeah.

           Mark pulls out a page from his suit jacket. He breathes in to 
           speak and-

           INT. CHURCH ALTAR - MORNING

           He is at the altar, with his beautiful bride, giving his 
           vows.

           Noah and the rest of the bridal party stand on the steps of 
           the altar looking up at the couple and pastor.

           Mark reads from the sheet, not a professional writer or 
           speaker by any means, but genuine and perfect none the less.

                                 MARK
                        I thought long and hard about 
                        asking you to marry me. I think 
                        it’s safe to say that our 
                        relationship was perfect just the 
                        way it was, don’t you think? And so 
                        I thought, should we even get 
                        married if things are so good? And 
                        I came up with the fact that I 
                        couldn’t think of anything better 
                        than to marry you.

           Mark starts getting teary eyed. Molly’s already a mess. Oh, 
           weddings. 

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Because you are the best person 
                        I’ve ever known, and the coolest, 
                        and the downright sexiest. 

           Mark’s Father from the pews shouts “Amen!”, and everyone 
           laughs. 

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Thanks Dad. And I’m not good at a 
                        lot of things, and you know this 
                        more than anybody. But I promise to 
                        always be there for you, even when 
                        you’re puking or watching Sex and 
                        the City, and I promise to always 
                        be faithful and respectful to you 
                        and your needs. I want to be your 
                        husband because I don’t know what 
                        else I would ever want from life 
                        than to put you first and make you-
           He turns the page over.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        As happy as you can possibly be. 
                        And that’s why I can’t wait to be 
                        your husband.

           He puts down the sheet. Molly hugs him instantly. A chorus of 
           “awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww’s” and eye-wiping.

           Noah watches his sister, his new brother, and not Anna. 

           He smiles. This is awesome. 

           PHOTOGRAPHS

           The requisite wedding party photographs. Anna with the 
           bridesmaids. Noah with the groomsmen. Everyone together.

           Noah smiles his way through them like a fucking champ.

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Noah leaves the church and admires the view outside. Central 
           Pennsylvania can be surprisingly beautiful. 

           He searches the remaining guests for Kelli.

                                 FELIX
                        Central Pennsylvania, huh. It’s no 
                        LA, I’m guessing. 

           Noah turns, and finds Felix standing against the wall, in his 
           cute tailored vest, smoking a cigarette.

                                 NOAH
                        I guess not.

           Taps out the ash.

                                 FELIX
                        You really upset Anna last night.

           Noah searches his mind for last night.

                                 NOAH
                        I don’t even... remember what I 
                        said that was bad last night...

                                 FELIX
                        Lovely. Okay, listen to me.
           Another puff. 

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know about you when it 
                        happened. I promise. I didn’t know 
                        about you until you were already in 
                        Los Angeles.

           Noah regards him.

                                 NOAH
                        Seriously?

                                 FELIX
                        Seriously.

                                 NOAH
                        You didn’t get... any... Picture 
                        text messages?

                                 FELIX
                        No, I did.

                                 NOAH
                        Then how did you not know about me?

                                 FELIX
                        Wait... what kind of pictures are 
                        we talking about here?

                                 NOAH
                        What kind are you talking about?

                                 FELIX
                        ...The good kind?

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, fuck! Fuckosaurus Rex! 

           Noah tries not to lose his fucking mind again.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        The ones she sent me probably 
                        weren’t even fucking real. Fuck. 
                        I’m so glad you smoke cigarettes.

                                 FELIX
                        These are herbal.

                                 NOAH
                        Damn you and your hipster French 
                        pretensions saving your life!

           Felix smiles, puts it out.
                                 FELIX
                        Regardless, I’m quitting. Tomorrow. 
                        Or something. 

                                 NOAH
                        She hates smokers.

                                 FELIX
                        Thankfully my vices don’t 
                        completely define my personality. 

                                 NOAH
                        Felix, if you know what she did to 
                        me, why the fuck would you be with 
                        her?

                                 FELIX
                        Because there was my life before 
                        her, and then after, and I liked 
                        the latter a lot more.
                             (in French)
                        And I could never let you go, no 
                        matter what goes on, cause I love 
                        you more than ever now that the 
                        past is gone.

                                 NOAH
                        Three things. One, you’re fucking 
                        lame for doing that. Two, she’s not 
                        Jesus Christ and three, don’t quote 
                        Dylan to me in French. That’s just 
                        wrong.

                                 FELIX
                             (laughs)
                        You know French?

                                 NOAH
                        I know Dylan. 

           Noah turns his back on Felix and admires the scenery.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        You know why I love Pennsylvania? 
                        She’s gone through a ton of shit 
                        and powered through. She survived 
                        the French. The British. The Civil 
                        War. Gettysburg. Nine-Eleven. 
                        Santorum. And look at her. 

           Her looks back at Felix.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        She’s still better than France.
           And with that, Noah walks away.

                                 FELIX
                        France survived Nazi’s!

                                 NOAH 
                             (not turning back)
                        D-Day, motherfucker!

           INT. DAD’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           Noah and his father pull into a parking space at the packed 
           lot of the reception. Noah’s Dad turns off the car. Sits 
           there silently. 

                                 NOAH
                        You alright, Dad? 

                                 DAD
                        I took dance lessons for this.

           Noah is too shocked to even find this funny. 

                                 NOAH
                        You’re shitting me.

                                 DAD
                        I might only get to do this once. 
                        God knows if I’ll even be alive 
                        when the hobbit decides she’s ready 
                        to breed.  

           Noah laughs.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        Least it’s not that Butterfly 
                        Kisses crap. 

           The old man stares at the full parking lot, with more cars 
           coming in all the time. 

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        All of these people here for my 
                        little Molly. If that ain’t the 
                        greatest, I don’t know what is. 

           Despite being a packed parking lot, under this new light, 
           it’s oddly beautiful.

                                 NOAH
                        I don’t know either.
                                 DAD
                        I do know that you didn’t come home 
                        last night.

           Dad looks over at him, a devilish glint in his eye.

                                 NOAH
                        I didn’t do that, trust me.

                                 DAD
                        Whatever.

           Noah smiles and reaches for the door.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Are you okay?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, I’m great.

           His Dad keeps looking at him. Noah is honest.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m really close to becoming a 
                        cynical misogynist that hates the 
                        world and doesn’t believe in love 
                        or faithfulness or anything beyond 
                        basic animal instincts and 
                        Darwinism. 

           Dad smiles. Surveys his son.

                                 DAD
                        No, you’re not.

                                 NOAH
                        I’m not?

                                 DAD
                        Naw. You’re twice the man I am.

           This moves Noah more than he could ever hope to articulate.

                                 NOAH
                        Dad...

                                 DAD
                        I’m not gonna say you’ll find an 
                        amazing girl, or you’ll lead an 
                        incredible, joy-filled life. I want 
                        those two things for you more than 
                        anything, but I don’t know if that 
                        stuff winds up in everyone’s cards. 
                        But I do know you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAD (CONT'D)
                        And you won’t be that blah blah 
                        cynical hater no matter how bad it 
                        gets, and you know why?

                                 NOAH
                        No. I don’t know anymore.

           Noah’s Dad smiles.

                                 DAD
                        Because you’re Noah Palmer, and 
                        you’re the shit.

           Noah hugs his Dad tightly. 

                                 NOAH
                        Thanks.

                                 DAD
                        You’re welcome. Now let’s roll. 

                                 NOAH
                        Yessir.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - AFTERNOON

           Noah finds his spot at the head table. Anna is there. They 
           don’t acknowledge each other as he sits down. 

           A phone number is scrawled on his specially made name card. 
           He pulls out of his phone, and dials.

           Ring ring. Ring ring. 

                                 KELLI (PHONE)
                        I’m going to tell you a story, and 
                        you are going to sit there and 
                        listen, understand?

           He looks for her in the crowd-

                                 KELLI (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Don’t! Just look straight ahead.

           He obeys.

                                 KELLI (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        His name is Carl. He’s about to 
                        turn thirty. He has brown hair, and 
                        green eyes. They look like planets, 
                        sometimes. He is five foot eleven. 
                        Stand up, Noah.
           Noah stands.

                                 NOAH
                        It’s been so long since I’ve gotten 
                        bossed around. 

                                 KELLI (PHONE)
                        Happy to help. Walk towards the 
                        little boy in the blue suit to your 
                        right.

           He looks, and sure enough, finds the little boy in the blue 
           suit.

                                 NOAH
                        That’s my cousin. His name is Jeb. 

                                 KELLI (PHONE)
                        There are real people named Jeb? 

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah. Wassup Jeb.

                                 JEB
                        Hi No-ah.

           They hug.

                                 NOAH
                        I’ll be right back, okay?

                                 JEB
                        Okie. 

                                 KELLI (PHONE)
                        Aww. Don’t milk it.

                                 NOAH
                        You love it.

                                 KELLI (PHONE)
                        Can I continue?

                                 NOAH
                        Sure.

                                 KELLI (PHONE)
                        Head to the woman also wearing 
                        white. Do you know her?

           Noah searches. It’s an easy find. He laughs.

                                 NOAH
                        No. No, I do not. That bitch.
           He heads across the room. 

                                 KELLI (PHONE)
                        Carl is from Colorado. He tries to 
                        grow facial hair, but looks like a 
                        pedophile when he does. He wanted 
                        to be an Imagineer when he was 
                        little, but wound up an architect. 
                        He doesn’t hate it, though.

           He arrives at the woman in white. He looks at her with 
           complete disapproval. Bitch.

                                 KELLI (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Go to the balloon tree.

           There’s a white balloon tree on the opposite side of the 
           room. He heads towards it. 

                                 NOAH
                        I’m really just aimlessly zig-
                        zagging right now-

                                 KELLI (PHONE)
                        He used to live in Chicago, but 
                        he’s in Portland now. His wife’s 
                        name is Hannah. They have a baby. 
                        Already have a baby. His name is 
                        Dominick. 

           He arrives at the balloon tree. On the other side of the tree 
           stands Kelli, her back to him.

                                 KELLI (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Carl’s got so much more now than he 
                        ever had with me. And I threw it 
                        away in less than ten minutes one 
                        night in an Austin hotel room.

           Beat. 

           Noah almost takes a step away. Doesn’t just yet.

                                 KELLI (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        So now you know.

           Noah hangs up the phone. She keeps it up to her ear.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        So maybe Anna did you a favor. 
                        Course corrected time travel 
                        fuckery or not.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        And maybe everyone’s an Anna in one 
                        way or an other, because maybe 
                        everyone’s a bit of a selfish 
                        fucktard. I’ll talk to you later. 

           She hangs up and turns around.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        Oh, hi. I didn’t see you there. 

                                 NOAH
                        Hey. 

           They stand there awkwardly.

                                 KELLI
                        I’m not gonna bullshit you. I know 
                        what kind of girl I am. I’m the 
                        girl that just drops into boy’s 
                        lives and makes them feel like a 
                        million bucks. But you’re... you 
                        shouldn’t fall for me. I’m just a 
                        mess of a girl trying to fix other 
                        people so I can fix myself. I’m the 
                        same girl as the one you lost, but 
                        with better hair. 

                                 NOAH
                             (laughs)
                        For a second there, I thought you 
                        went home.

                                 KELLI
                        My flight’s in a few hours. 

                                 NOAH
                        Good. I mean. No. I mean. I’m glad 
                        you’re still here.

           She smiles. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 KELLI
                        Sometimes I hate my life. But I 
                        really like your tie. 

           She adjusts it.

                                 NOAH
                        Thanks.
           She nods. A different woman might cry, but not Kelli. She’s 
           cried enough in her life to not need to again. She smirks 
           instead.

                                 KELLI
                        Fucking hate weddings.

           A car door outside opens, and they look out to see Molly and 
           Mark getting out of the limo.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        To your station, captain.

           He smiles and, as he walks away, takes her hand for the 
           tiniest of moments.

                                 NOAH
                        I’m gonna dance with you. 

                                 KELLI
                             (silently)
                        Okay.

           MONTAGE

           The reception events. It’s all so perfectly lovely. The food. 
           The speeches. The dances. 

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Noah is talking with Carly at the bar, both of whom are 
           nursing Shirley Temples. The dance floor is packed behind 
           them. 

           Anna and Felix are there, dancing suuuuuuuper close. 

           Noah does his best to ignore them.

                                 NOAH
                        Can I tell you a secret?

           She nods.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        You were, by far, the prettiest 
                        maid of honor of all time, and your 
                        speech-
                             (kisses his fingers)
                        Sublime. I teared up. Put mine to 
                        shame. 
                                 CARLY
                        You tear up a lot though. So...

           But he’s not even looking at her anymore... 

           His eyes are on the dance floor, where gasps come like 
           unwelcome rain...

           The DJ stops playing...

           People magically part out of the way like a Bible story...

           And there is Felix, KNEELING before Anna. 

           PROPOSING.

           Noah can’t really hear what’s being said.

           But it looks sweet. 

           And loving.

           Anna’s hands cover her mouth in shocked ecstasy. 

           Felix cracks out The Diamond Ring. 

           Anna, oblivious to all but Felix, audibly YELPS.

           And Noah looks like he just saw a suicide bomber detonate. 

           It takes her a while to say what she must say, but of course 
           she says it, and loudly, through tears of joy.

                                 ANNA
                        Yes. Yes yes yes!

           She cries as he slips the ring on her finger. People coo and 
           applaud as the newly engaged couple hug. 

                                 NOAH
                             (just a little too loudly)
                        Are you fucking serious?

           The happy audience slowly diverts their attention to the 
           crazy ex-boyfriend holding a Shirley Temple. 

           Kelli watches from the outskirts, beside Mark and Molly.

           Everyone has wide saucer eyes.

           But Noah laughs.
                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I mean... come on... at a wedding, 
                        that’s like, the hokiest place to 
                        propose, I mean-

           And the laughter turns suddenly into tears. 

           No one knows how to react, least of all Anna or Felix.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        My proposal was a lot better. 

                                 ANNA
                        Noah-

                                 NOAH
                        Seriously though, if you’re going 
                        to cheat on me at least cheat on me 
                        with someone awesome, like Leonardo 
                        DiCaprio or Josh Holloway or a 
                        fucking lesbian. And don’t get 
                        engaged to him.

           He finishes the Shirley Temple, which is sort of difficult 
           when you’re borderline sobbing. 

           It is deathly quiet. He puts the empty glass down 
           triumphantly.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        There’s not even any alcohol in 
                        this. 

           He is now all too aware of the silence. After the worst 
           several seconds imaginable, he quickly leaves the room. 

           EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT

           Noah sits by himself on a low stone wall, staring out at epic 
           Harrisburg below. He wipes the tears from his eyes when he 
           hears Molly approaching from behind.

                                 MOLLY
                        You’re lucky I don’t have a 
                        freaking trail on this dress, or 
                        I’d have had to send Marky Mark out 
                        to talk.

                                 NOAH
                        I’m still weirded out that you call 
                        him Marky Mark, and that he looks 
                        suspiciously Wahlbergian.
           Noah takes off his suit jacket and lays it beside him on the 
           wall. Molly smiles at his thoughtfulness and hops on the wall 
           so that she’s facing him.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Molly, I’m realllllly sorry that 
                        just happened.

           She laughs it off. 

                                 MOLLY
                        The DJ recovered really well. I 
                        think shit like that might go down 
                        semi-frequently. It’s totally going 
                        to be all anyone talks about at 
                        your wedding someday. And for the 
                        next three weeks in Harrisburg. I 
                        can’t believe he proposed to her at 
                        my wedding. I can’t believe you 
                        proposed to her and I never knew. 
                        And she said yes?

           He nods.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        So you guys didn’t “just break-up”, 
                        did you.

                                 NOAH
                        No. Not really. Not really at all. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 NOAH
                        I dunno. I kinda lost my mind. 

           Silence. 

           She touches his hand. And at long last, he looks his sister 
           in the eye and tells her-

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Your groomsman is kind of a bitch. 

           She puts her head against his. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Obviously. 

           Noah laughs. They look out at the setting sun.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know. I promise. 
                                 NOAH
                        I know. I’m sorry you know now. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Look at me.

           He does. She holds his head in her hands.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        You might be a bitch, but I love 
                        you, and noooooo girl cheats on 
                        you, even if she was, is and will 
                        someday probably again be one of my 
                        BFF’s. 

                                 NOAH
                        If Marky Mark ever cheats on you, I 
                        know a massive gay black dude that 
                        can revenge-rape him.

                                 MOLLY
                        ...I don’t know what to say to 
                        that, but if he does wander, you 
                        better believe I’ll call you on 
                        that. 

                                 NOAH
                        Good.

                                 MOLLY
                        Was this whole trip hell for you?

           Noah genuinely considers this.

                                 NOAH
                        Parts of it, but parts of it were 
                        kick-ass.

                                 MOLLY
                        Really? Cuz of Marky Mark’s sloppy 
                        seconds?

                                 NOAH
                        You know it.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’ve never met her before the other 
                        day, but from what I can tell, she 
                        seems really hot. 

                                 NOAH
                        She’s like... really hot on the 
                        inside too.
                                 MOLLY
                        Gag. But good. 
                             (whispers)
                        Did you guys... do it?

                                 NOAH
                        No. Not even a little bit.

                                 MOLLY
                        That sounds gross. 

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, it sounds like we considered 
                        just doing tip. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Blurgh!

                                 NOAH
                        Says the woman getting something 
                        special from Marky Mark tonight.

                                 MOLLY
                        Aaaaaaaaaanyway, people are 
                        dancing. It’s my wedding. You 
                        coming back?

                                 NOAH
                        Of course I am. It’s your wedding. 

           She hugs him.

                                 MOLLY
                        You’ll always be my favorite 
                        bridesmaid.

           He smiles.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Molly dances with Mark, her shoeless feet resting on his 
           shoes. 

           Everyone watches Noah, as infamous as a streaker. But worse. 

           Noah watches his sister, and then nearer, he sees Kelli 
           dancing with his Dad. 

           And nearer still, walking towards him, is a concerned-but-
           also-furious looking Anna.

           She bites her lip and asks slowly-
                                 ANNA
                        Are you alright?

           He stars down at the ground.

                                 NOAH
                        I’ve had better... self-centered 
                        moments of masochism. Are you 
                        alright?

           She shows him her ring-less hand. 

                                 ANNA
                        We decided to retract the proposal. 
                        I’m not going to let you have that. 

                                 NOAH
                        Good. That’s... good. 
                             (crazy awkward beat)
                        I’m sorry I Hiroshima’d your 
                        moment.

                                 ANNA
                        I’m sorry I... Nagasaki’d your 
                        life.

           They almost smile together. Almost.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        So let’s not talk to each other for 
                        several years. If that. Okay?

                                 NOAH
                        Yes please, that sounds so great. 

                                 ANNA
                        I miss you, ya know. You colossal 
                        bitch. 

                                 NOAH
                        I miss you too. You 8-bit dick. 

           She holds out her ringless left hand in a fist.

           He smiles and fist bumps it. 

                                 ANNA
                        And... period. 

                                 NOAH
                        Period. 

           After a moment, she pulls her hair behind her ear and walks 
           away towards Felix.
           Felix and Noah see each other. Felix shrugs and give him the 
           finger. Noah gives him the Vulcan salute. And it’s good 
           enough for them both.

           Noah stands there, momentarily lost in life, before seeing 
           his Dad dancing with Kelli.

           He laughs and walks towards them.

                                 DAD
                        So Kelli, please tell me: how 
                        attracted are you to my moustache? 

                                 KELLI
                        Intensely. 

           Dad is completely satisfied and turns to Noah.

                                 DAD
                        And that’s how it’s done.

                                 NOAH
                        I could learn a lot from you. 

                                 DAD
                        Ditto.

           He puts his hand on his son’s shoulder. 

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna get drunk. You better 
                        join me tonight. I feel like we 
                        have to talk and swap some war 
                        stories. 

                                 NOAH
                        Absolutely. 

                                 DAD
                        Miss Kelli.

                                 KELLI
                        Mister Palmer.

           Dad walks away, and Kelli takes Noah’s hand in hers, 
           beginning to dance. Kelli tries to look concerned, but 
           completely fails. 

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        So I’m sorry but that was seriously 
                        the most hilarious thing I’ve ever 
                        seen. This is the best wedding 
                        ever. 
                                 NOAH
                        I should feel like shit.

                                 KELLI
                        You don’t?

                                 NOAH
                        Not now. I think I got my period. 
                        In a non-menstrual way. 

                                 KELLI
                        I saw a fist bump. 

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah. Magically there was no 
                        evisceration.

                                 KELLI
                        Oooh. Say that word again.

                                 NOAH
                        Eeeeeevisceration.

                                 KELLI
                        Damn you and your five syllable 
                        words. You’re going to make me have 
                        a scrabblegasm.

                                 NOAH
                        I know longer words. I know like, 
                        huge dinosaur names.

                                 KELLI
                        Hit me with one.

                                 NOAH
                        Micropachycephalosaurus.

                                 KELLI
                        Whoa. My knees just buckled.

           Noah laughs. People continue to look at him like he’s super-
           weird. He looks at her, and smiles.

                                 NOAH
                        I wish you lived in Los Angeles. 

                                 KELLI
                        I work there every couple of 
                        months. 

           He nervously puts a strand of her hair behind her ear.
                                 NOAH
                        I wish I was okay enough to date 
                        you. I wish I met you twelve to 
                        eighteen months from now.

           She raises an eyebrow. A sexy eyebrow. A sexibrow. 

                                 KELLI
                        Oh really?

                                 NOAH
                        In my head, when-slash-if I get my 
                        shit together, I’d love to call you 
                        up and say, hey Kelli, I’ve got my 
                        shit together, and I don’t know if 
                        you’re seeing someone now or 
                        married or pregnant-

                                 KELLI
                        Would pregnancy be a dealbreaker?

                                 NOAH
                        Depends on the context, or you’re 
                        totally pissed at me for what went 
                        down at my sister’s wedding, but I 
                        was wondering if I could maybe take 
                        you out on a date. And I know you 
                        live in Chicago and I live in LA 
                        and I have no money and that’s 
                        weird but maybe it’s not. 

                                 KELLI
                        Jeepers. You did fantasize a bit 
                        about me. 

                                 NOAH
                        I didn’t sleep at all last night.

                                 KELLI
                        And why do you think I’m worth a 
                        pesudo-fantastical long distance 
                        relationship scenario?

                                 NOAH
                        Because I know you might think 
                        you’re just like her, but you’re 
                        different too. You’re still dying 
                        over what you did.

           She looks away. He speaks the truth.
                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        And maybe that’s a good thing, 
                        because we’re all fucktards, and 
                        sometimes realizing that we have 
                        scars is the only way we can press 
                        on.

           She smiles.

                                 KELLI
                        Well now. 

                                 NOAH
                        And because I think you might be 
                        really fucking awesome, and I’d 
                        hate to blow it all by not being 
                        able to give you the best of me. 

           She stops dancing. He puffs up his cheeks.

                                 KELLI
                        That is easily the most romantic 
                        thing anyone’s ever said to me with 
                        no ulterior motive.

                                 NOAH
                        I have ulterior motives, they’re 
                        just long term. Besides, I make the 
                        best mix CD’s. And romantic crafts. 
                        Involving crayons. Glitter 
                        optional. 

                                 KELLI
                        You’re my favorite tenth grade girl 
                        ever.

           She smiles to herself, looks at her feet.

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        I want a mix CD by the weekend.

                                 NOAH
                        I already started making you one in 
                        my head. I’m calling it, “Thanks 
                        For Kissing Me, I Hope There’s More 
                        Where That Came From, parenthesis, 
                        In The Future”. 

           A riotous dance pop song turns up. Like Flo Rida or some 
           shit. Lots of woops and hollas from the wedding party. Yuck. 

           Noah and Kelli stand motionless with complete disapproval.
                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        This song isn’t on it.

                                 KELLI
                        Thank Christ.

           They don’t dance like the rest of them. This is A MOMENT!

                                 KELLI (CONT’D)
                        Twenty bucks say you try to kiss me 
                        at the airport.

                                 NOAH
                        You’re on.

           Noah reaches into his wallet and hands her a twenty dollar 
           bill. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, there’s no way I’m that.

           She laughs, wraps her arms around his neck.

                                 KELLI
                        Who the hell are you, Noah Palmer?

                                 NOAH
                        I used to know, but things have 
                        changed.

           They smile at each other. That’ll just have to do for now.

           And so they dance, and so we end.

                                                                THE END
