           FADE IN:

           EXT. THE JUNGLES OF INDONESIA - DAY

           TRIBAL NATIVES race through dense foliage, cutting a path with 
           machetes, leading a patrol of INDONESIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL -- 
           shouted commands and radio chatter.

           The tribesmen hack through the perimeter of the brush and the 
           party emerges onto the wide silt bank of a muddy river.  

           A PACK OF WILD BOARS let out a chorus of squeals and scatter 
           into the brush.  Several VULTURES waiting their turn take 
           wing.  And there, splayed on the river bank we find --

           A BODY.

           One of the soldiers approaches.  The body is badly decomposed, 
           its face and hands eaten away by the scavengers. 

           The soldier checks the pockets of the dead man and pulls out a 
           wallet.  He checks the ID -- we don’t see the identity. 

           The Soldier speaks into his radio in Indonesian --

                                 SOLDIER
                   (subtitled)
                        ...We found him.

           As the soldiers gather around the body, the tribesmen look on 
           warily, keeping their distance, like some superstitious 
           prohibition is holding them back.

           WE PULL UP -- viewing the scene from high above, the sound of 
           CHOPPER BLADES cut the air as we --

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT 

           A RATTAN CEILING FAN moves the humid air.  A HAND tosses ice 
           into a crystal low ball, pours a healthy measure of whiskey.  
           DAVID WALSH(40’s) takes a long drink.

                                 WALSH
                        Sure I can’t pour you one?

           Walsh sits in a club chair opposite PAUL JENNINGS (30’s), 
           buttoned down, groomed, un-amused.  He has a legal pad in 
           hand, a micro-recorder sits on the coffee table. 

                                 JENNINGS
                        No thanks.  I’m working.
                                 WALSH
                        All the more reason.

                                 JENNINGS
                        Can we just keep going, please?

           Walsh raises his glass in a mock toast.  He’s got a good gut 
           going, an easy smile and sparkling eyes -- but his face tells 
           the story of a man well-acquainted with his whiskey.

                                 WALSH
                        Fire away.

           Jennings hits play on the recorder.

                                 JENNINGS
                        How did you meet Michael Guzman?

                                 WALSH
                        The first time or the second time?

                                 JENNINGS
                        Just in general, how did you meet?

                                 WALSH
                        Look, if you want to get a handle on 
                        this thing, you’re gonna...

                                 JENNINGS
                        ...I just want the truth.

                                 WALSH
                        The truth?  You figure that out, you 
                        be sure to fill me in, okay?

           Jennings doesn’t respond.  He just waits.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Pour yourself a goddamn drink.  You’re 
                        making me nervous.

                                 JENNINGS
                        Mr. Walsh...

                                 WALSH
                        ...January of ‘93 - I had three 
                        properties crap out on me within a six 
                        week period.

           And we go...

           EXT. RENO NEVADA - MORNING

           A SUPER READS:  RENO, NEVADA - JANUARY  1993.
           SHOTS survey the city:  A grey winter morning. 

           -- COWS GRAZING the frozen scrubland on the edge of town.

           -- AN ABANDONED MINE high in the rocky foothills.

           -- OLD CASINOS and tired neighborhoods.

           -- THE POT-HOLED STREETS lined with oily snow and battered 
           cars.  Steam rising from every orifice of the city. 

           We sail over the rugged cityscape of this once great mining 
           town.  A chilling wind carries us...

           EXT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - MORNING

           A watering hole that dates back to the boomtown days. It’s 
           seen better times and there are definitely too many cars in 
           the parking lot for this hour of the morning.

                                 WALSH (V.O. NARRATION)
                        ...I was on the balls of my ass, 
                        scrambling.  Not exactly uncharted 
                        waters for me, but I was in pretty 
                        deep...

           A beat up late 80’s Cadillac, El Dorado pulls into the lot, 
           covered in a layer of road grime, its front bumper held on 
           with wire.  It lumbers into a spot.

           Inside, Walsh stares out, eyes like a Bukowski poem, bracing 
           himself for the day.

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh enters like the cock of the walk, back slapping and 
           waving hellos, a well-liked regular.  His suit looks like it 
           might have been slept in...more than once.  

           The place is faded and frayed, poorly lit and choked with 
           cigarette smoke.  A sense of desperate optimism prevails. 

           Middle-age men in bad suits with bad hair fill the tables and 
           booths, working phone lines and yellow pads.  These are bottom-
           feeder stock promoters -- modern-day prospectors.

           Walsh approaches one of the traders, clamping down on his 
           shoulders with both hands, working out the knots.  This is 
           BOBBY BURNS(50’s), balding, pouring a shot into his coffee.

                                 WALSH
                        Bobby Burns!
                                 BURNS
                        Oh yeah, that’s the stuff... How ya 
                        doin’, Davey?

                                 WALSH
                   (by way of answering)
                        Three contractors, a Mexican, an 
                        Italian and a Jew, all drop dead on 
                        the same day....

           Smiles from the guys at the surrounding tables.  They all lean 
           in to listen.  Walsh clearly loves the attention.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        ...They get to Heaven and St. Peter 
                        tells them God wants to remodel the 
                        Pearly Gates and they’re taking bids.  
                        So the Mexican measures the gates, 
                        does some calculations and submits his 
                        bid - “Five thousand - twenty five 
                        hundred for materials, twenty five 
                        hundred for labor.”  The Italian sizes 
                        it up and submits his bid - “It’s 
                        gonna run ya seven large - thirty five 
                        hundred materials, thirty five for 
                        labor.  The Jewish guy, he doesn’t 
                        even measure, no calculations, no 
                        nothing.  He says, “Ten grand!”  St. 
                        Peter doesn’t understand, “How did you 
                        come up with that figure?”  “Easy,” 
                        the guy says, “Twenty five hundred for 
                        me, twenty five hundred for you - and 
                        we get the Mexican to do it for five!”

           Everyone laughs!  Walsh beams, punctuating the punch-line with 
           a slap on Bobby’s back.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                   (after a beat; to Bobby)
                        So, whatcha working?  Anything I 
                        should know about?

                                 BURNS
                        Telmerek.  Their Aukland stake, the 
                        bank called the note.  I picked up a 
                        bunch of the debt, I gotta flip it 
                        before the call.

                                 WALSH
                        Any bites?

                                 BURNS
                        Nibbles.
                                 WALSH
                        Keep throwing that line.

           A pat on the arm and he’s off to the bar where his double shot 
           of Seagrams is being poured by ROY BAKER(60’s), sweet face 
           that’s seen some miles -- like an old boxer. 

                                 ROY
                        A little eye opener, David?

                                 WALSH
                        Breakfast of champions, Roy.  
                        Breakfast of champions.

           Walsh raises his glass in his signature salute.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                   (under)
                        To the mother load.

           Walsh pounds the whiskey and we...

                                             CUT TO:

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - BOOTH - LATER

           Walsh sits at his “desk” -- the corner booth in the back of 
           the bar.  Working one of the two phones on the table.  He 
           flicks the ash from his smoke into a half-full ashtray.

                                 WALSH
                        ...it’s an outstanding opportunity.  
                        The geologic reports are very 
                        encouraging and we’re taking a very 
                        aggressive position.  We’re looking at 
                        yields in the high six figures.  
                        That’s right... A prospectus?
                   (there’s no prospectus)
                        ...Of course, I can mail one right 
                        out.  I should tell you, though - this 
                        offering is already oversubscribed. 
                        I’m taking out of my own holdings to 
                        cover demand, but hey, we can always 
                        get you in on the next one... I 
                        understand.  Look, why don’t I give 
                        you a ring this afternoon and we’ll 
                        see if there are any parcels left.  
                        Well, if you just give me... 

           Click.  Another one that got away.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                   (to the dead phone)
                        You have a pleasant day...
           He hangs up the receiver and grabs his drink, a HAND stops it 
           before it reaches his lips.

           The hand belongs to KAY ELLIS (30’s), the Greenhorns cocktail 
           waitress, very pretty.  There’s a sweetness and dignity to 
           Kay, but a weariness as well -- she’s been through it.  She 
           holds her watch out for Walsh to see.

                                 KAY
                        You watching the time?

                                 WALSH
                        Oh, Christ.

           He slides out of the booth and rises quickly.

                                 KAY
                        You look like hell, David.

                                 WALSH
                        Only cause I’m standing next to you, 
                        beautiful.

           He gives her a kiss and she smiles in spite of herself.

                                 KAY
                        You’re gonna be late.

           Walsh grabs his briefcase and heads...

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Walsh is striped to his waist, his gut hangs over his belt, 
           giving himself a sink bath, doing his best to clean up.  Spray-
           on deodorant, a gargle of Scope, a little dab of hair groom, 
           an electric shave and a few long squirts if Visine.

           He pulls a relatively fresh shirt from his briefcase, snaps 
           the creases out of it and we go --

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Walsh emerges from the bathroom, tucking in his shirt.  He 
           pulls on his jacket and presents himself to Kay.

                                 KAY
                   (a knowing smile)
                        Come here.

           David steps over and Kay reaches down and zips up his fly. 

                                 WALSH
                        Good?
                                 KAY
                        Knock ‘em dead.

           Walsh kisses her, a little squeeze of her ass.  He grabs the 
           remains of his drink from the booth and tosses it back.

                                 WALSH
                        I’ll come by for you after.

                                 KAY
                        No, I’m picking up a shift at the Wal-
                        mart.  I’ll see you at home.

           A flash of guilt that he covers with a smile -- the things she 
           has to do to keep them afloat.  Another kiss and we...

                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - MORNING

           A crumbling downtown.  Ageing uninspired towers -- a modern 
           city, half born and now dying.  A passing delivery truck honks 
           as we go...

           INT. COLSON & WELLS CAPITOL GROUP - DAY

           Walsh sits in the reception of a low rent investment bank.  
           Vinyl covered faux Frank Miller furniture,  motivational 
           prints on the walls -- “PINNACLE”; “TEAMWORK”; “EXCELLENCE”.

           He absently flips through an issue of “Northern Prospector” 
           magazine.  He tosses it down on the coffee table and checks 
           his watch, looks up at the receptionist.

                                 WALSH
                        ...Any idea how much longer, 
                        sweetheart?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Shouldn’t be too much longer now, Mr. 
                        Walsh.

           Two bankers stride in.  They’re young, groomed, nice suits.  
           The look on their faces practically screams “Let’s get this 
           over with.”  The senior of the two, LLOYD STANTON(late 20’s), 
           extends his hand. 

                                 STANTON
                        Mr. Walsh, I’m Lloyd Stanton.  My 
                        colleague Henry Andrews.

           Walsh puts on his smile and shakes hands.
                                 WALSH
                        Good to meet you.

                                 STANTON
                        Come on back.

           They lead Walsh across the TRADING FLOOR -- men with rolled up 
           sleeves work land lines, scanning PCs the size of ovens.  A 
           babble of cross-talk -- the feel of a boiler room operation.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Stanton and Andrews take seats at one end of the conference 
           table.  Walsh stands uncomfortably alone at the other end.

                                 STANTON
                        Take a seat, Mr. Walsh.  What can we 
                        do for you?

                                 WALSH
                        Why don’t we wait for Clive?

                                 STANTON
                        Mr. Colson is tied up in a meeting.

                                 WALSH
                        Huh... No offense boys, but I was 
                        supposed to be meeting with Clive.

                                 STANTON
                        None taken.  But, if you were supposed 
                        to be meeting with Clive you’d be 
                        meeting with him.  You’re supposed to 
                        be meeting with us.  So... What do you 
                        got?

           That stung.  Walsh takes just a moment to recover.  He slaps a 
           smile on his face and slides documents across the table.

                                 WALSH
                        We’re developing some very exciting 
                        properties that are spot-on for your 
                        investor profile - low buy-in with a 
                        sizable upside and the beautiful part 
                        is they’re all only twelve to eighteen 
                        months to cash positive.

           Stanton and Andrews listen impassively, scanning the docs.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Manitoba?
                                 WALSH
                        We picked up an option on a skipped 
                        claim at auction.  

                                 ANDREWS
                        It’s a ninety day option.

                                 WALSH
                        Yes, the window is narrow, but there’s 
                        an excellent shale formation that...

                                 STANTON
                        Natural gas?  Environmental impact’s 
                        gonna be a bitch.  I don’t like the 
                        liability.  What’s next?

           He dismissively flips the page, leaving Walsh to quickly shift 
           gears.

                                 WALSH
                        Eastern Utah.  We’re sitting on a nice 
                        land-lease opportunity.  The 
                        overburden is borax rich so there’s an 
                        immediate revenue source, but the real 
                        prize is in the granite under-shelf.  
                        Our studies point to rich chromium and 
                        nickel deposits.

                                 ANDREWS
                   (re: docs)
                        There’s a pretty long chain of title 
                        on this claim.  No payouts.  What 
                        makes you think you’re gonna be 
                        luckier then all these others?

                                 WALSH
                        All under capitalized.  Never got past 
                        development - none of them.

                                 STANTON
                        Under capitalized?  I’m not sure under 
                        capitalized does your situation 
                        justice.

           Walsh swallows down another helping of pride and pushes on.

                                 WALSH
                        We’ve hit a down turn, yes, true 
                        enough, but...
                                 STANTON
                   (cutting him off)
                        Mr. Walsh, Bre-X Mineral Corporation 
                        has a practical value hovering just 
                        above zero.  Your debt load is 
                        untenable and you come to us with raw 
                        land - no infrastructure, no fundable 
                        assets. We can’t underwrite this.

                                 WALSH
                        I’m talking about a small offering 
                        here.  If you’ll just look at the 
                        financials you’ll see what I see - 
                        which is money!

                                 STANTON
                        Not our money.  

           He closes the documents with an air of finality.

                                 STANTON (CONT’D)
                        We can’t help you, Mr. Walsh. 

                                 WALSH
                        These are jackpot, gentlemen! You back 
                        away from these - these are career 
                        changing opportunities.  

                                 STANTON
                   (rising)
                        If you’ll excuse us.

                                 WALSH
                        I want to talk to Clive!

           Walsh stands, his already red face flushing, every broken 
           capillary showing like battle scars.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        My father put Clive Colson on the map. 
                        He built this god damn bank!

                                 STANTON
                        You’re not your father, Mr. Walsh.

           Like a dagger.  Walsh stands stunned by the statement.

                                 STANTON (CONT’D)
                        Bring us something we can sell and 
                        we’ll talk.

                                 WALSH
                        These are good properties.
                                 STANTON
                        They’re crap, Walsh.  Played out hand-
                        me-downs.  I’d be embarrassed to even 
                        talk to my clients about them.  
                        Andrews... We’re done here.

           Stanton slides the documents across the table at Walsh.

                                 STANTON (CONT’D)
                        Is there anything else?

           Walsh gathers up his papers.

                                 WALSH
                        Yeah. Go fuck yourself.  Both of you.

           He grabs his bag and walks out with as much dignity as he can 
           muster.

           Stanton watches him go.  He knows he did his job, he kicked 
           Walsh’s ass -- doesn’t mean he has to feel good about it... 
           there but by the grace of God... 

           Andrews, on the other hand, is actually smiling, and seriously 
           misreading his boss.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Not even noon and the guy reeks like a 
                        still.

                                 STANTON
                        Shut the fuck up, Andrews.  Jesus.

           INT. COLSON & WELLS CAPITOL - RECEPTION DESK - MOMENTS LATER  

           Walsh heads for the door in a daze.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Validate your parking, Mr. Walsh?

           Walsh waves her off with what will have to pass for a smile.  
           He exits the office and we go...

           INT/EXT. WALSH’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh closes the door of his car, leans back against his seat, 
           breathing fast and shallow, trembling.

                                 WALSH (V.O. NARRATION)
                        ...That had to be the worst day of my 
                        life.
           We pull in tight on Walsh’s face, panic rising in his eyes...

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           AN AMBER STREAM OF SEAGRAMS splashing over a tumbler of ice.

                                 WALSH (V.O. NARRATION) (CONT’D)
                        ...They were gonna foreclose on my 
                        house, take my car.  I was staring 
                        down the barrel of bankruptcy...

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are...

           EXT. RENO NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

           A street of small tract homes.  A nice little neighborhood 40 
           years ago, now it feels a lot like the people who live here -- 
           tired and in need of attention.

           It’s getting dark, an icy wind blows through the streets.

           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           The place is small -- could be nice if it was kept up.  On the 
           counter we see a mess of BILLS, mostly RED NOTICES -- Phone. 
           Heat. Car.  

           Walsh sits on the edge of his sofa, talking on the phone, 
           pitching for his very life.  

           A SERIES OF DISSOLVES take us through --

                                 WALSH
                   (into phone)
                        ...we’re looking at yields in the high 
                        six figures... Yes, that’s right.  
                        David Walsh. Bre-X mineral 
                        Corporation.  I spoke to your wife 
                        last week...

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           A CIGARETTE ground out in a half-full Circus, Circus Casino 
           clown-shaped ash tray.  THE FLAME OF A LIGHTER -- the SUCK and 
           CRACKLE as another cigarette glows to life.

                                 WALSH (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        ...Yes sir, I’m sending it out as we 
                        speak.

           Walsh paces now, phone cradled as he pockets his lighter and 
           takes a long pull on his drink. 
                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m so glad I caught you at home... 
                        This is an outstanding opportunity, 
                        the geologic reports are very 
                        encouraging...  

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           MORE WHISKEY -- as much spills on the table as makes it into 
           the glass.

                                 WALSH (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        ...I have to be honest, this offering 
                        is already oversubscribed.

           Walsh is now slumped in an armchair.  On the coffee table we 
           can see he’s made a pretty good dent in the bottle.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m taking out of my personal 
                        holdings to cover demand...Could you 
                        hold on a sec, I’ve got to take this 
                        call...

           He muzzles the phone and reaches for his drink.

                                 WALSH (V.O. NARRATION) (CONT’D)
                        Bre-X, the company my grandfather 
                        literally scratched out of the side of 
                        a Nevada mountain, that my father 
                        built into a real player.

           He drinks with a shaky hand.  Steadies, and downs the rest.

                                 WALSH (V.O. NARRATION) (CONT’D)
                        ...It only took me five years to run 
                        it into the ground.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           THE VIEW OUT THE FRONT WINDOWS -- It’s now night.  A freezing 
           rain falls.  Walsh looks out into the darkness...or, maybe 
           he’s just staring at his own reflection.  

           He’s blind drunk, struggling to get his mouth around the 
           words.  The fight has gone out of him...

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                   (on phone)
                        If you could just let me know when a 
                        good time would be for us to sit down, 
                        I’m sure you would see...
           But that’s as far as he gets.  The hum of the dead line.  He 
           sets the phone down, leans his head against the cold window 
           and closes his eyes.  His breath fogs the glass instantly.

                                 WALSH (V.O. NARRATION) (CONT’D)
                        At the close that day, Bre-X was 
                        trading at four cents a share - if it 
                        was trading at all... 

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           TIGHT ON: Hands, ice, whiskey. Walsh, refreshes his glass.

                                 WALSH
                        Rock bottom, as they say - pun 
                        intended.    

           Cigarette, fire, a deep inhale.  Walsh’s eyes -- turning his 
           attention back to Jennings. 

                                 JENNINGS
                        That doesn’t answer my question, Mr.  
                        Walsh.  How was the Indonesian venture 
                        with Guzman initiated?

           Walsh lets out a leisurely plume of smoke.  He leans back in 
           his chair -- he’s in no hurry.  If Jennings wants the story, 
           he’s gonna have to indulge him for awhile.

                                 WALSH
                        I’m trying to tell you.  Just relax.  
                        I’m getting there.

           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kay walks into the house, leaving the dripping umbrella 
           outside.  She peels off her rain coat and moves into...

           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...where she finds Walsh passed out on the sofa.  The bottle 
           of Seagrams sits, mostly drained on the cluttered coffee 
           table.

           She empties her tips onto the adjoining kitchen counter and 
           moves over to Walsh, her face a conflict of emotions -- 
           sadness, concern -- she loves him, but that doesn’t mask the 
           disgust.
                                 KAY
                        Come on.  Let’s get you to bed.

           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kay supports Walsh the best she can as he staggers into the 
           room.  She eases him into bed and he looks up at her.  And, 
           just for a flash, he’s sober as a stone.

                                 WALSH
                        What am I gonna do, Kay?  What am I 
                        gonna do?

           She runs a comforting hand along his cheek.  

                                 KAY
                        Shhh... Sleep now.  We’ll think about 
                        it tomorrow.

           And his eyes ease shut, surrendering.  She keeps caressing his 
           cheek, but her eyes are tense with worry... What are they 
           going to do?...

                                 WALSH (V.O. NARRATION)
                        I must’ve had a half a gallon of 
                        Seagrams in me.  More.  I should’ve 
                        been dead.  But I wasn’t.  Instead, 
                        what happened was I had a dream.  I 
                        mean, literally.  I had a dream.

           Kay bends down, kisses his forehead as Walsh whispers... 

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Indonesia...

           And suddenly we are --

           EXT. INDONESIAN JUNGLE - DAY

           We soar above the Jungle canopy, diving down through the lush 
           foliage, emerging atop a jagged ridge overlooking --

           A PRISTINE JUNGLE VALLEY.  A shimmering river winds through.  
           Everything is bathed in BRILLIANT GOLDEN LIGHT, breathtaking.

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        I met Mike Guzman seven years earlier. 
                        That was the first time. I still had a 
                        little money then and Indonesia was 
                        booming.  I was looking for a way to 
                        get in...  
           EXT. JUNGLE RIVER - DAY

                      INDONESIA - SEPTEMBER, 1987

           A MAN motors up river in a carved out skiff, exchanging 
           pleasantries with the half-naked NATIVES panning for gold 
           along the banks.

           He’s tanned and muscular, squinting against the light from 
           beneath the brim of a perfectly worn hat.  Meet MIKE GUZMAN 
           (late 30’s).  An Ox-Bridge educated explorer with an appetite 
           for woman and bare-knuckle adventure. 

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        ...Back then, if you were aiming to 
                        put a hole in the ground in Indonesia, 
                        you wanted Mike Guzman telling you 
                        where to dig.

           ON GUZMAN -- wading hip deep in a dark jungle tributary.

                                 WALSH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He’s what they call a “river walker.”  
                        The real deal - a hands-on Geologist.

           --Guzman walking a mountain crest line -- hanging from a 
           rappel line hundreds of feet above the canopy, hacking at a 
           granite face with a rock axe. 

                                 WALSH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He had just discovered the largest 
                        Copper mine in all of South Asia.  
                        Everyone wanted a piece of him.

           INT. INDONESIAN MINING TOWN - BAR - NIGHT

           Think the skankiest bar you can imagine, then make it twice as 
           skanky.  Topless Indonesian girls dancing on the bar.  Five 
           inch pumps and ping pong balls.  You get the picture.

           Guzman holds court at a corner table. Wildcatters and rogues 
           hang on his every word.  Chief among them is David Walsh.

           Guzman scoops a handful of sawdust off the floor and scatters 
           it across the table, using his finger to “draw” in the dust.  
           He speaks with intensity and a crisp AUSTRALIAN ACCENT that 
           gives him an unquestioned air of authority. 

                                 GUZMAN
                   (as he illustrates)
                        You got the Nazca plate off South 
                        America, the Pacific plate, Juan de 
                        Fuca, North American, South American.

                        You’ve got trenches, fissures and 
                        fault lines -  Aleutian, Marianas, 
                        Tonga - the plates rubbing and 
                        grinding up on each other like a 
                        proper rutting - six trillion kilobars 
                        of pressure, ten thousand degrees 
                        Celsius kicking up geothermic hot 
                        spots all along the Pacific rim... And 
                        it’s been going on forever.  

           He looks up.  Taking them all in with a sly smile...

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        Pressure, heat and time - that’s 
                        mineralization.  And there’s no better 
                        cooker than right here.

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        He called it the “Ring of Fire” theory 
                        and he definitely had everyone’s 
                        attention.  I was too small-time to 
                        really get his ear, but I kept tabs on 
                        him...
                   (pause)
                        ...And then I had the dream.

                                 GUZMAN
                        It’s how I found the copper, and it’s 
                        why I’ll find the gold.

           RENO, NEVADA -- 1993: 

           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Still drunk, Walsh savagely digs through his desk, riffling 
           through business cards until he finds it -- MIKE GUZMAN. 

                                 WALSH
                        ...Okay, okay...

           He moves to a dresser, a JEWELRY BOX sits on top.  A quick 
           glance to the bedroom door, all clear, and he opens the box.  

           He picks through the sparse collection of items and pulls out 
           an ANTIQUE PAVE DIAMOND AND GOLD LADIES PENDANT WATCH.

           Kay comes in just as Walsh jams the watch into his pocket.

                                 KAY
                        ...I made you some sandwiches, they’re 
                        on the counter.  Salami and mayo, 
                        that’s all we have.
                                 WALSH
                   (kisses her)
                        Salami and mayo. My favorite. I’ll 
                        call you later.

           He pulls on his jacket.  Kay watches him with a worried 
           expression.  She proceeds gingerly. 

                                 KAY
                        Kind of a rough night... You okay?

                                 WALSH
                        Never better.  

           He takes her by the shoulders.  He’s remarkably convincing.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Everything’s gonna be great, Kay.  
                        Don’t worry.
                   (another quick kiss)
                        I'll see you when I get back.

                                 KAY
                        What?  Get back?  David?

                                 WALSH
                   (as he exits)
                        I’ll be a few days, maybe a week. I’ll 
                        call you tonight.

           And he’s gone.  Kay just stands there, mystified, about to go 
           after him when she sees the open jewelry box -- racing over to 
           look inside.  Her watch is gone!  

                                 KAY
                        ...David!  No!

           INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

           A ROLL OF CASH changes hands.  Walsh shoves the bills in his 
           pocket and turns for the door.

                        I didn’t even think twice. I was on my

           Walsh pours his drink and tries to make his big frame 
           comfortable in the cramped seat.

           Walsh sits forward in his seat.  This is important and he 
           wants Jennings to understand. 

                                 WALSH

                        It was the gold calling.  I know that

           EXT. JAKARTA, INDONESIA - ESTABLISHING - MORNING (1993)

           The city sparkles -- it’s a collision of tradition and 
           technology; tall towers and shanty towns; soaring wealth and 
           crushing poverty.  There’s something electric about it. 

           We find David Walsh walking into one of the finest hotels in 
           the world...

           INT. THE SHANGRI-LA HOTEL - NIGHT

           Lavish.  Everything the name implies.  Walsh is on a house 
           phone, a cigarette smolders between his thick fingers.   

                                 WALSH
                   (into phone)
                        Yeah, Mike, it’s David Walsh.  I’m in 
                        the lobby of the Shangri-la.  We must 
                        of got our wires crossed about the

                        I’ll try and move things around. Give 
                        me a jingle, okay?  

           He hangs up, drinks, paces nervously.  Impeccably turned out 
           patrons eye him warily.  He clearly does not belong.

           He checks his watch -- looks over.  Still no Guzman.  He drags 
           on his smoke and ash splashes all over his dark jacket.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Damn it.

           He starts to furiously brush it off when he hears...

                                 GUZMAN (O.C.)
                        David Walsh.

           Walsh turns, the ash still clinging to his lapel, and there’s 
           GUZMAN -- tan and tall.  Walsh looks even worse in Guzman’s 
           reflected light.

                                 WALSH
                        Hey, Mike!  Thanks for coming.  It’s 
                        good to see you.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Didn’t expect to hear from you again, 
                        mate.

           They shake hands and Guzman notices all the disapproving eyes 
           on them.  Walsh is feeling it too, but...

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I know a place nearby, a bit more 
                        low-key, if you like?

                                 WALSH
                        They pouring here?

           Walsh doesn’t give a fuck what anyone thinks and Guzman 
           already likes that about him.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Let’s set ’em up.

                        Due to a childhood ailment my breasts 
                        stopped growing when I was twelve.  
                        Jim says, that’s okay, I have a 
                        deformity, too.  My penis is the size 
                        of an infant’s.  So, after some dates, 
                        Sally and Jim end up in the sack.  
                        After a minute Sally screams and jumps 
                        up - “I thought you said your cock was 
                        the size of an infant?!”  Jim looks at 
                        her and says “It is - 6 pounds 8 
                        ounces, 14 inches long!”

           Walsh laughs, too loud.  The Waitress arrives with the drinks 
           in time to catch the punch line.  Guzman takes his drink with 
           an apologetic smile.  He glances at his watch.

                                 GUZMAN
                        So, David, what are we talking about?

           Walsh takes a beat.  Puts on that selling smile.

                                 WALSH
                        Ring of fire, Mike.  Ring of fire.

           Guzman gives a little laugh, sips his drink.

                                 GUZMAN
                        You’re playing my greatest hits, now. 
                        Fire’s gone out of that one.

                                 WALSH
                        What are you talking about?

                                 GUZMAN
                        Never panned out.
                   (a hint of resentment)
                        My fellow geologists pretty much 
                        thought it was crackpot, but, after my 
                        copper hit, there were plenty of guys 
                        willing to bite - plenty of guys who 
                        wish they hadn’t.

           Walsh tries not to show his profound disappointment.  He takes 
           a moment, the wheels turning, then...

                                 WALSH
                        Well, what the hell?  You called it 
                        wrong, what are you gonna do?

           Guzman shoots a look -- he knows Walsh is trying to get a rise 
           out of him, but he’s too cool to take the bait.
                                 GUZMAN
                        In this game there is no right or 
                        wrong, there’s only hits and misses.  
                        I missed.

                                 WALSH
                        So, you still think you’re right?

                                 GUZMAN
                        I don’t think I’m right.  There’s gold 
                        here.  It’s just the getting after it, 
                        is all.

           Walsh smiles.

                                 WALSH 
                        I’m really happy you said that, Mike.  
                        I believe you.

                                 GUZMAN
                        You believe me?  That’s awfully nice. 
                        I’m so relived.

                                 WALSH
                        Hey, don’t patronize me.  I came a 
                        long way to talk to you.

                                 GUZMAN
                        I’m the geologist who cried gold.  
                        Now, you show up, seven years after 
                        hearing me rant in a Borneo whore 
                        house and you’re ready to drill.  
                        Forgive me, I certainly didn’t mean to 
                        patronize. 

                                 WALSH
                        Ring of fire is real. I knew it the 
                        minute I heard it - whore house or 
                        not.  It was like a lightning strike 
                        and I never forgot it.

           Guzman laughs -- almost mockingly. 

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, you go ahead and laugh, it 
                        doesn’t bother me, I’m used to it.  
                        But you have to hear this - I don’t 
                        just believe, I know.

                                 GUZMAN
                        You ask any major player and they’ll 
                        tell you you’re dead wrong.
                                 WALSH
                        Why would I give a flying fuck what 
                        any of those pricks think?  The big 
                        boys don’t prospect - they don’t have 
                        the balls for it.  We do the digging 
                        and they take the glory.

                                 GUZMAN
                   (a hint of derision)
                        Have a lot of time in the field, do 
                        you?

                                 WALSH
                        I was born on the side of a mountain.  
                        My father scraped everything he had 
                        out of the rocks and he died with 
                        dirty finger nails.  I intend to do 
                        the same.

                                 GUZMAN
                        No one will back me.  You get that? No 
                        one.

                                 WALSH
                        I’ll get the money.

                                 GUZMAN
                        No offense, but you look like you had 
                        to rob someone to get here.

                                 WALSH
                        You just tell me where to dig, I’ll 
                        make sure the bills are paid.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Look, I’ve got a nice thing lined up 
                        back home - University post - pension, 
                        health, all the comforts.

           Walsh cuts him off, leaning across the table.

                                 WALSH
                        ...You know it’s out there, Mike. I 
                        can see it in your eyes.  You walk 
                        away from this, you’re walking away 
                        from who you are.
                   (doesn’t blink)
                        And you know something else?  I don’t 
                        think this is an accident.  I don’t 
                        think it’s an accident that this thing 
                        hasn’t worked out for you until this 
                        moment.  My whole life, I’ve waited 
                        for this moment.  I know it.  I feel 
                        it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WALSH (CONT'D)
                        And don’t give me some bullshit about 
                        a rocking chair job at some dumb ass 
                        school, teaching rich little bastards 
                        how to tap rocks. 

           Guzman just might be wavering.  Walsh won’t let him get away.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Mike, this business wrote me off years 
                        ago.  And it seems you been running 
                        bad yourself.
                   (then)
                        Let’s prove ‘em wrong.  We can prove 
                        them wrong about everything. 

           Guzman considers.  A beat. 

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Tell me I’m fucking crazy - I’ll be on 
                        the next plane. 

           Walsh waits, sweating, eyes locked with Guzman who is 
           inscrutable.  After a long beat, Guzman rises from the table.

                                 GUZMAN
                        You’re fucking crazy.

           He tosses cash on the table.  Walsh visibly deflates.  Guzman 
           starts off, stops and looks back... Then... 

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing in the morning?

                                 WALSH
                        Why? 

                                 GUZMAN
                        You got a hat?

                                 WALSH
                        No.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Buy one.  I’m talking you up river.

                                 WALSH
                        What river?

                                 GUZMAN
                        The only river that matters.
           They look at each other -- the die is cast.  Guzman walks out 
           and as Walsh drains his drink as we...

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. BUSANG RIVER - PIER - MORNING

           A shanty town on the outskirts of the city, just at the edge 
           of unbridled wilderness.  Guzman and Walsh are on a flimsy 
           pier, boarding a traditional skiff -- a dug-out log boat 
           outfitted with a small outboard.   

           Walsh eyes the boat warily from beneath his wide straw hat.

                                 WALSH
                        Where are we going?

                                 GUZMAN
                        About seven hours up river.

                                 WALSH
                        This thing gonna make it?

           Guzman just looks at him, “fucking civilians.”  Then...

                                 GUZMAN
                        You ever see a pit viper up close? 

                                 WALSH
                        No.

                                 GUZMAN 
                        You want to keep it that way.
                   (re: the boat)
                        So let’s hope she does.

           He steps on board, leaving a nervous Walsh on the dock.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        Beer’s in the cooler.  Help yourself.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. BUSANG RIVER - DAY

           The outboard purrs as they motor up river.  Walsh takes in the 
           NATIVE TRIBESMAN panning for gold along the sandy bank.  It’s 
           like they’ve travelled back in time.

                                 GUZMAN
                        They’ve been panning this river for 
                        thousands of years - that’s how it got 
                        it’s name, “Busang.”
           Guzman lets that hang there, like a tease.  Walsh bites...

                                 WALSH
                        Busang?

                                 GUZMAN
                        “The river of gold.”

           Walsh can’t contain his smile.

                                 WALSH
                        You gotta be shiting me.

           Guzman just smiles back.  He gives the outboard some gas and 
           we go...

           EXT. JUNGLE - AFTERNOON

           THWACK -- a machete cuts through the dense foliage.  Guzman is 
           in the lead, clearing the way through the steep terrain.  
           Walsh is winded, drenched in sweat.  He mops his brow.

                                 WALSH 
                        Jesus... How long?

                                 GUZMAN
                        About 40 million years.

           Walsh looks at him -- what the hell’s he talking about?

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        40 million years for all the geology 
                        to cook.

                                 WALSH
                        I meant...

                                 GUZMAN
                        I know what you meant. You should 
                        learn this now...out here, you’re 
                        either patient or you’re dead.
                   (then)
                        Stop your whining, follow the trail.  
                        We’ll get there.

           Walsh looks.  If there’s a trail, only Guzman can see it.

           EXT. JUNGLE - TOP OF THE RIDGE - DUSK

           Guzman emerges from the foliage, pulling himself onto a 
           clearing on the top of a ridge.  Walsh struggles up after --
           Guzman stands on the edge of the ridge line, staring out.  
           Walsh is bent over, sucking for air, drowning in sweat, not 
           even noticing what Guzman is staring at, until...

                                 GUZMAN
                        Take a look.

           Walsh looks out and is instantly spellbound -- it’s JUST LIKE 
           HIS DREAM -- GOLDEN LIGHT sparkles over a pristine valley.  
           The BUSANG RIVER cutting through the heart of the jungle.

                                 WALSH
                        My god - that is pretty.

                                 GUZMAN
                        There have been a few folks up here 
                        tapping over the years...
                   (pointing)
                        ...but they’ve all focused on the 
                        foothills to the south - there’s a 
                        basalt overlay which is usually a good 
                        sign, but they never found anything.

           He points to an area on the opposite side of the valley.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        What interests me is right there, on 
                        the south bank.  See the depression in 
                        the land - you can just make it out, 
                        it’s like a giant left a footprint.

           He turns to Walsh, like speaking the gospel.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        Something happened under there.  
                        Something hot and angry.  That’s where 
                        we’ll find the tasty bits. 

           But Walsh is barely listening.  He’s transfixed.

                                 WALSH
                   (almost to himself)
                        It’s out there...

                                 GUZMAN
                        Damn right it is.

           And as they stand there, two men together, staring out at 
           their destiny...we...

                                             CUT TO:
           EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE - EVENING

           Like a wild west mining town -- bars, supply stores, a 
           brothel.  A NATIVE VENDOR with a push cart scoops rice into 
           wooden bowls, laying on meat grilled over a propane flame.

           Walsh and Guzman collect their bowls and when Walsh goes for 
           his wallet, Guzman stops him, producing a pouch from his 
           pocket.  He removes a pinch of GOLD DUST from the pouch, 
           dropping it on a small scale on the vendor’s cart.

           Weights are adjusted, a little more dust and it’s done.  
           Guzman turns to Walsh.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Coin of the realm.

           EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE - EVENING

           Walsh and Guzman eat, sitting on crates by the side of what 
           passes for a road.

                                 GUZMAN
                        The lease on the property’s currently 
                        held by a Canadian company.  They’re 
                        looking to unload it cheap - they’re 
                        getting buried on some Kazakh venture.  
                        Up to their eyes I hear.
                   (then, almost a warning)
                        Never had the capital to develop the 
                        site in the first place.

                                 WALSH 
                        Well, first thing we’re gonna do is 
                        move some paper.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Like I told you, none of the big guys 
                        are gonna touch us.  

                                 WALSH
                        Then we’ll talk to the little guys.  I 
                        know how to sell this, Mike.  I’ve 
                        been waiting my whole life to sell 
                        this.  How much do we need?

                                 GUZMAN
                        Seven - seven fifty to start.

           Ouch... Walsh takes a beat to re-focus.

                                 WALSH
                        But how much are we gonna need?
                                 GUZMAN
                        We gotta nail down a permit, which 
                        means lining pockets - this is 
                        Indonesia. Corrupt. Violent.  And 
                        they’ve got a very special place in 
                        their hearts for Westerners.

                                 WALSH
                        I’ll get the money.  Whatever it 
                        takes.  

           Walsh is about to wipe his face with his NAPKIN, but has a 
           sudden idea.  He pulls out a pen and quickly scribbles 
           something down on it then slides the napkin over to Mike.

                                 GUZMAN
                        What’s this?

                                 WALSH 
                        A contract.  Read it.  Sign it.

           Guzman looks over what Walsh has written on the napkin.  They 
           share a look -- a moment.  WE DON’T SEE WHAT’S ON THE NAPKIN.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Fair enough.

                                 WALSH 
                        We got a deal? 

           Guzman signs and sticks his hand out to Walsh.  They shake.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Deal.

           INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           Walsh is still in the chair, staring out.  Then he leans in 
           like he’s about to share the secrets of the universe.

                                 WALSH 
                        For the first time in my life, I was 
                        selling something I really believed in 
                        - I could feel it in my bones.  Any 
                        real salesman will tell you - if you 
                        believe it, you can sell it.

           PRE-LAP SOUND:

                                 BOBBY BURNS (V.O.)
                        Hell yeah it’s risky - I’m being 
                        straight here.  But hey, no risk, no 
                        reward, right...
           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - MORNING

           The place is packed -- it’s the usual crowd, but everyone’s 
           working the phone.  The mood is electric.

           Bobby Burns is at his table mid-pitch.  Around him all the 
           regulars are telling versions of the same story.

                                 BOBBY BURNS
                        This guy Guzman knows his shit.  Yeah, 
                        Walsh landed the big fish...

           AT THE BAR -- Guzman collects a drink, taking in the chaos of 
           the room, catching snippets of the phone pitches --

           “...guy’s got a platinum resume... Largest copper strike in 
           history... M.I.T, he’s a real brainiac... Right, the ‘copper 
           king’... Busang, it means ‘river of gold’. No, I’m not fucking 
           kidding, What do you say?... “$20,000 minimum buy in, but 
           that’s only today.”  Can I put you down?... This is just 
           gettin’ rollin’, baby.  Big time!”

           Walsh comes up to Guzman, all smiles -- he loves these guys.

                                 WALSH
                        What’d I tell you - the best.

                                 GUZMAN
                        We don’t even have the exploration 
                        rights.  What are they selling?

                                 WALSH
                        It’s never the thing that sells, it’s 
                        the story.  And right now, the story’s 
                        you.  Get used to it, pal.

           And as we look over this makeshift trading floor, the SOUND OF 
           KEYS BEING PUNCHED rises above the din of sales chatter -- 
           TAPE PRINTOUT SCROLLING, and we are... 

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - BACK BOOTH - NIGHT

           Bobby Burns furiously enters figures into an ADDING MACHINE.  
           Walsh and Guzman wait anxiously.  It’s been a long day, 
           everyone’s exhausted.  

           Bobby scrolls the tape, tearing it off with a flourish.

                                 BOBBY BURNS
                        Two hundred, sixty seven thousand and 
                        change.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Not exactly the number I had in mind.
                                 WALSH
                        Can you make it work?

                                 GUZMAN
                        It’s enough for the permit and we can 
                        sink a few holes.  If we work fast and 
                        get lucky, who knows...

                                 BOBBY BURNS
                        All we need is a little good news and 
                        we can raise more money.

                                 WALSH
                   (raising his glass)
                        Then here’s to good news.

           Guzman raises his beer with a certain amount of skepticism, 
           but what the fuck, he’s in this far.  They clink glasses and 
           we go...

           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A suitcase on the bed, Walsh zips it up.  He heaves the strap 
           over his shoulder and turns.  Kay stands in the doorway.

                                 KAY
                        I want my watch back, David.

                                 WALSH
                        Kay, I told you.  You’re gonna get it 
                        back.

                                 KAY
                        No, I want it now.

                                 WALSH
                        I’m making a run here, babe. You’re 
                        part of this.  I’m doing this for us.

                                 KAY
                        David, I don’t want to hear it.  That 
                        watch is the only thing I have left of 
                        my mother’s.  Because my father stole 
                        everything else she ever had.  You 
                        understand?

                                 WALSH
                        Yeah, I understand.  You don’t trust 
                        me.  You talk about our dreams. Our 
                        ranch in the mountains, right?  Clean 
                        air and big views - our little place 
                        above it all.  That’s what I’m doing 
                        right now, Kay.  This is not a joke.  
                        This is real. This is the one.
                                 KAY
                        I know you’ve raised a lot of money, 
                        David and I’m happy for you - the 
                        mortgage is paid, the car insurance, 
                        thank you - but I want my mother’s 
                        watch back, okay? 

                                 WALSH
                        No...it’s not a lot of money, Kay.  
                        Not nearly enough.  Barely what we 
                        need to get started. 

           He kisses her, she pulls away, fighting the tears.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Look at me.  Look at me, Kay.  I love 
                        you.  And I know what the watch means 
                        to you.  I just need to know you trust 
                        me.  You’re with me all the way.  

           The tears come, she’s torn by this.

                                 KAY
                        David... Okay, okay...I do.  I do love 
                        you and I do trust you...

           He holds her, kisses her.

                                 WALSH
                        Okay. I’ll see you when I get back.  I 
                        won’t take long, I promise.

           She nods, tears in her eyes -- Walsh heads off, but turns 
           back.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Okay, here...you can time me.

                                 KAY
                        What?

           And he dangles her mother’s watch before her eyes.  Kay takes 
           the watch, squeals, jumps into his arms, kissing him wildly.

                                 WALSH
                        ...Okay, okay...Jesus...I have to 
                        catch a plane.

                                 KAY
                        I love you, David.

           PRE-LAP SOUNDS... the call to prayer.
           EXT. JAKARTA - DUSK

           A towering minaret in the heart of the old city.  The calls of 
           the faithful wail over the setting sun...

                         JAKARTA, JUNE 1994

                                             CUT TO:

           INT. JAKARTA - SHANGRI-LA HOTEL - DUSK 

           David and Guzman get ready for a meeting.  Guzman is looking 
           at paper work.  Walsh comes out of the bathroom -- the sound 
           of a flushing toilet, tucking in his shirt.

                                 GUZMAN
                        What’s that smell?

                                 WALSH
                        I just took a shit.  

                                 GUZMAN
                        Are you wearing cologne?

                                 WALSH
                        Yeah, why, you getting turned on?

                                 GUZMAN
                        Go wash it off.

                                 WALSH
                        What?  Fuck you.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Wash it off, now.  They’re going to be 
                        here any minute.  

                                 WALSH
                        It’s a little Old Spice?! 

                                 GUZMAN
                        Listen to me!  We have one shot at 
                        this.  He’s the Minister of The 
                        Interior of Indonesia, if he doesn't 
                        like us because of the way we look or 
                        the way we smell - we are done.  If he 
                        really doesn't like us it could be 
                        much worse.  The cologne is an insult.  
                        We don’t insult. We don’t talk.  We 
                        listen, we get the deal done and we 
                        get the permit.  Do not fuck this up 
                        David.  Now go wash it off. 
           David stares for a moment - like a humiliated child.  He 
           doesn’t like it at all.  He goes into the bathroom.  Slams the 
           door.  Off Mike looking very nervous, we...

                                             CUT TO:

           INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL - SUITE - LATER

           A FORMAL DINNING ROOM, super-luxe. WAITERS in waist-coats and 
           ties deferentially clear away the appetizer plates.

           Seated at the table is the INDONESIAN MINISTER OF MINING AND 
           FORESTRY, decked out in diplomatic uniform.  TWO LARGE ARMED 
           MEN stand behind, flanking him on both sides. SECURITY.

           WALSH and GUZMAN sit across from the Minister, looking like a 
           very odd couple -- Walsh in an ill-fitting suit, a sheen of 
           persperation on his face. Guzman, dressed in white linen and 
           an open collar.  Cool as can be. 

           A STEWARD pours hot liquid into small bowls at each setting.  
           The Minister speaks with a well-mannered Indonesian accent.

                                 MINISTER
                        ...I have reviewed your permit request 
                        for the Busang property.

           Walsh picks up his bowl and sips his “tea.”  Guzman clears his 
           throat -- Walsh looks over, “What?...”  Guzman gives a subtle 
           shake of the head.  

           The Minister watches with a superior air.  He pointedly washes 
           his hands in his bowl.

           WALSH FREEZES.  The “tea” is for hand washing not drinking. 

                                 MINISTER (CONT’D)
                        ...There was a conspicuous lack of 
                        documentation.  Surely there are 
                        geological reports from previous 
                        explorations of this site?  

                                 GUZMAN
                        Yes, excellency.  We chose not to 
                        include them because there were no 
                        conclusive indicators.  I could send 
                        them, but I thought it best not to 
                        waste your time.

           During this exchange, Waiters have served GIANT PRAWNS, heads 
           still on and HALVED URCHIN, spiky shell with gooey meat.

           Walsh blanches.  Guzman gives him a warning look.
                                 WALSH
                   (to waiter; what the hell)
                        Can I get a fork?  

           The waiter doesn’t move, obviously uncomfortable.  He glances 
           to the Minister for guidance.

                                 MINISTER
                   (without looking at Walsh)
                        These are dishes you eat with your 
                        hands, Mr. Walsh. 

           The Minister expertly cracks the head off a prawn.

                                 MINISTER (CONT’D)
                   (still to Guzman)
                        And what makes you think you will find 
                        what others before could not?

                                 GUZMAN
                        I believe, quite simply, sir, that 
                        they were looking in the wrong place 
                        and ran out of capitol before they 
                        could find the right place.
                   (beat)
                        The underlying geology is sound.  
                        There’s gold there, excellency.

           A long moment.  The Minister gives no outward indication one 
           way or another.  Walsh jumps in to fill the silence.

                                 WALSH
                        Mike’s the best in the business - he’s 
                        got our plan of attack all laid out.  
                        If anyone can...

           The Minister cuts him off, again without so much as a glance 
           in his direction.  Walsh fumes at the snub.  Pissed.

                                 MINISTER
                        The natural resources of my country 
                        are a gift from God - they are the 
                        divine inheritance of all my 
                        countrymen.  As Minister of Mining and 
                        Forestry, the stewardship of these 
                        resources is a responsibility I take 
                        very seriously.

           Walsh has had enough of this pompous asshole.  

                                 WALSH
                   (under)
                        Give me a break.
           Guzman senses the coming explosion, tries to head it off.

                                 GUZMAN
                        We understand entirely, sir, and allow 
                        me to assure you that Mr. Walsh and I 
                        share your...

           ...Too late.

                                 WALSH
                   (to a Waiter)
                        Hey!  Who’s a guy gotta fuck to get a 
                        drink around here?

           Walsh definitely has the Minister’s attention now.

                                 MINISTER
                        I am a Muslim, sir. I do not drink.

                                 WALSH
                        I’m an American.  And I do.  And last 
                        time I checked, I was hosting this 
                        little shin-dig...so you might want to 
                        throw a question or two in my 
                        direction, you know?

                                 MINISTER
                        Yes, you are American. You may be 
                        paying for this meal, but you are a 
                        guest in my country, seeking the 
                        dispensation of my office.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Okay, look... David, let’s just take a 
                        step back here.

                                 WALSH
                        You’re right. And I apologize. I can 
                        see I’ve offended your religious and 
                        moral sensibilities.

           And with that, he pulls a THICK ENVELOPE from his jacket, sets 
           it down on the table with a THUD.

           A long held breath.  The Minister stares Walsh down with eyes 
           ablaze.  Walsh doesn’t blink.  Guzman is going to kill him.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        You know, now that you mention it, 
                        I’ve been thinking of converting to 
                        Islam.  I mean, if we don’t find any 
                        gold at least I’ll get the forty 
                        virgins, right?
           Everyone reacts.

                                 GUZMAN
                        David - enough!

                                 WALSH 
                        Or maybe I’ll go half.  Twenty’s a 
                        windfall - hell, if they’re really 
                        virgins two would probably kill me. 

           Walsh laughs with a “fuck you” smile.  The Minister rises.

                                 MINISTER
                        We are done here.

           He throws down his napkin.  Walsh stands fast.  The body 
           guards step forward.

                                 WALSH
                        Yeah, why don’t we cut the bullshit 
                        and get this dance over with?

           He shoves the envelope across the table, SPILLING OUT CASH.

           The Minister stares at the money, then back at Walsh.  He 
           sweeps from the room -- his entourage follows.  The door slams 
           behind them.

                                 GUZMAN
                        You fucking idiot.

           Guzman grabs the envelope and goes.  Walsh is alone, his face 
           flushed with anger, embarrassment -- he knows he fucked up.  
           He moves over to the bar, pours a big drink and drains it.  

           He throws the glass at the wall -- it shatters!

                                 WALSH
                        FUCK!

           Guzman comes back in, hot, moving right to Walsh, and before 
           Walsh can say a word -- CRACK!  Guzman punches him in the 
           face, driving him against the table.  Plates hit the floor.

                                 GUZMAN
                        You stupid son of a bitch!  When are 
                        you going to learn to keep your 
                        fucking mouth shut?!

           Walsh shoves Guzman away, ready to fight.

                                 WALSH
                        That guy was an asshole!
                                 GUZMAN
                        Yeah?  Well that asshole has our balls 
                        in a vice.

           Guzman moves to the bar, pours a drink, cooling down.

                                 WALSH
                        You gonna tell me what happened?

           Guzman turns back to him, taking his time.

                                 GUZMAN
                        ...He took the money.

           A smile spreads across Walsh’s face.  Guzman doesn’t want to 
           give him the victory.

                                 WALSH
                        Of course he took the money.  It’s 
                        money.

           Guzman just shakes his head. 

                                 GUZMAN
                        You’re a lucky bastard, David.
                   (serious; a warning)
                        Don’t fuck me.

                                            SMASH TO:

           EXT.  BUSANG VALLEY - DAY

           A glorious sunny day, the sky is blue and the river sparkles.  
           We pan down and find --  A small army of NATIVE WORKERS are 
           hard at it.  Crude OUT-BUILDINGS under construction.

                     BUSANG VALLEY - FEBRUARY, 1994

           We find WALSH and GUZMAN taking in the activity.

                                 WALSH
                        It’s gonna be great, Mike. It’s gonna 
                        be great.

           Suddenly, a gentle SUN SHOWER rains down...everything 
           sparkles.  It’s beautiful, but Guzman doesn’t think so...He 
           stares up into the sky, knowingly...

                                 GUZMAN
                        Monsoon’s coming early.

           CRACK!  A FLASH OF LIGHTING.  ROARING THUNDER and we...

                                             CUT TO:
           EXT. BUSANG SITE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

           The sky is black, churning.  The RAIN comes down in sheets. 

           A SERIES OF SHOTS --

           -- BEAT UP TRUCKS (Soviet military surplus) roll onto the 
           site.  Walsh and Guzman, soaked to the bone, supervise the 
           native workers as they begin to unload.

           -- AN OLD DRILLING RIG on a rusty TRAILER is pulled by a team 
           of OXEN.  The WHEELS sink in the mud and Guzman shouts orders 
           over the howling wind as Natives drive the Oxen forward.

           -- PIPE IS PULLED OFF THE BACK OF ANOTHER TRUCK.  In the 
           BACKGROUND, workers are assembling the DRILLING RIG, climbing 
           rain-slick scaffolds, like some ancient devotees constructing 
           a monument to a wrathful God.

           -- A BACKHOE DRAGS THE EARTH -- cutting a fresh road through 
           the forest.

           -- MAIN TENT -- rain thumps the canvas roof.  Guzman stands 
           before a map of the site, pointing out the strategy to Walsh. 
           A FOREMAN and a few other WORKERS listen in.

                                 GUZMAN
                        We’ll start here at the Southeast bank 
                        and step out in a semi-circular 
                        pattern.  That’ll be the most 
                        efficient use of our money.
                   (favoring Walsh)
                        It’s like a game of “Battleship.” When 
                        we get a hit we’ll drop holes all 
                        around and follow the contour of the 
                        vein. 

           -- A SPINNING DRILL SHAFT rattles the RIG’S framing.  The 
           sound is deafening, even in the continuing downpour.

           Guzman oversees the FOREMAN and three men as they guide in 
           pipe, pushing the drill deeper and deeper into the earth.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                   (shouting over the din)
                        That’s one hundred feet!  Let’s keep 
                        it coming - we have to get to at least 
                        three hundred to get a good look at 
                        what’s down there!

           -- HUNDRED FOOT ROCK CORES are laid out on the ground.  We 
           pull back we see ten cores, then twenty, then fifty cores.
           -- A DIAMOND TIPPED CIRCULAR SAW cuts the CORES into three 
           foot sections.

           -- A ROCK CRUSHER, as the core sections are fed into it.  
           Workers collect the rubble in CANVAS SACKS at the other end.

           -- THE SACKS, as they’re tied closed with WIRE.  HOT WAX is 
           poured over the sacks, imprinted with the BRE-X LOGO -- a 
           TAMPER-PROOF SEAL.

                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. BUSANG SITE - DAY

           A break in the rain.  Guzman and Walsh stand ankle deep in mud 
           as the canvas sacks are loaded onto a truck.  They look like 
           they’ve been through a war.  

           The last sack is loaded and Guzman gives the truck a rap on 
           the side.  The truck pulls away, belching smoke.  Walsh and 
           Guzman watch it go -- it’s carrying their dreams. 

                                 WALSH
                        What do we do now?

                                 GUZMAN
                        We wait.

           EXT. BUSANG SITE - NIGHT

           The rain is torrential again.  Mud flows down the mountains 
           and into the camp.  The river ready to burst.  The MAIN TENT 
           looks like it’s about to float away.

                                 WALSH (O.S) 
                        Fuck!  Fuck!...God damn it!

           INT. BUSANG SITE - TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh is going over some papers, the cover page reads, “Indo-
           Karta Laboratories.  Assay Report.”

                                 WALSH
                        ...These things look worse every time 
                        we get one.

           Walsh throws the papers down, but Guzman doesn’t respond, he’s 
           got his head buried in his maps.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        We’ve put a hundred and twenty holes 
                        in the ground and got shit.
                                 GUZMAN
                        I’m gonna try something else.  I’m 
                        moving further up the seam line.

                                 WALSH
                        Well you better try it fast.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Remember what I told you about 
                        patience?

                                 WALSH
                        Remember what I told you about money?

                                 GUZMAN
                        You said money wasn’t a problem.

                                 WALSH
                        It’s becoming a problem.

           Walsh suddenly shudders with a chill.  He has to sit down. 

                                 GUZMAN
                        You don’t look so good.

                                 WALSH
                        It’s ninety eight degrees out and 
                        pissing down rain.  How the fuck am I 
                        supposed to look?

           Walsh starts to cough, hacking uncontrollably. 

                                 GUZMAN
                   (a hand to Walsh’s head)
                        You’re burning up, mate.  That’s 
                        nothing to mess with.

                                 WALSH
                   (forcing himself to stand)
                        I’m fine.

           He moves to Guzman’s maps.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Now, show me what’s next.

           Walsh hacks violently -- off Guzman’s concerned look we...

           INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           BACK WITH THE INTERVIEW -- Walsh lets out a long plume of 
           smoke, swirling the ice in his drink. 
                                 WALSH
                        We drilled our holes, assayed the 
                        cores and got nothing.  Zero.  We were 
                        nearly busted - out of money, out of 
                        time, but, no way I was giving up - I 
                        was gonna find a way to keep going if 
                        it killed me.  I picked up a bad case 
                        of malaria. Over a million people a 
                        year still die of malaria - bet you 
                        didn’t know that...and fuck if I 
                        wasn’t on the list. 

           EXT. BUSANG SITE - NIGHT (1994)

           That fucking rain.  WORKERS are assembled under a TARP -- if 
           ever there was a disgruntled mob, this is it.  The FOREMAN 
           speaks to his men in their native language.

           GUZMAN, hustles through the downpour, protecting a file of 
           paper under his coat.  He gives a worried glance to the 
           workers before ducking inside.

           INT. BUSANG SITE - MAIN TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh is laid out on a camp bed.  He’s swollen, pale, 
           bloodshot eyes and covered in sweat -- malaria.

                                 GUZMAN
                   (re: the papers)
                        I’ve got the new assay reports.

           Walsh manages to sit up.  It’s an effort to speak, painful.

                                 WALSH
                        Talk to me.

           Walsh starts to cough, like he’s hacking up broken glass.

                                 GUZMAN
                        There nothing to talk about.  We’re 
                        not finding anything.

                                 WALSH
                        Shit...SHIT!

           A beat.  What’s there to say, except more bad news...

                                 GUZMAN
                        The workers are leaving, David. 

                                 WALSH
                        No... Okay...okay, look...You gotta 
                        talk to them, tell them anything - 
                        just buy us some time.
                                 GUZMAN
                        I’ve talked to them...and talked.  
                        They’re not listening to me.

           Guzman gives him a look -- Walsh knows what he’s thinking. 

                                 WALSH
                        Look at me, Mike.  I can’t go out 
                        there.

                                 GUZMAN
                        It has to be you.  This is your show.  
                        You’ve got to convince them...make 
                        them believe.  

           Walsh looks at his friend.  He loves the belief he sees in 
           Guzman’s eyes and that’s enough to get him to his feet.

                                 WALSH
                        Don’t let me die in this jungle.

           EXT. BUSANG SITE - OUTSIDE TENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Guzman watches as Walsh talks with the workers under the tarp.  
           We can’t hear what they’re saying, but it’s heated.  

           After a few moments, Walsh shakes the Foreman’s hand.  It 
           could be “You’ve got a deal.”  It could be, “Goodbye.”

           Walsh walks back to Guzman as the workers begin to disperse, 
           making their way toward the gates.  Walsh does his best not to 
           stumble.  He rests his hand on Mike’s shoulder like it’s just 
           a friendly gesture -- in truth, he’s about to fall down.

           He throws a look back to the men.  Then to Guzman...

                                 WALSH
                   (re: the tent)
                        I don’t know if I can make it back in 
                        there on my own.

           Guzman leads him inside...

           INT. BUSANG SITE - TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh collapses on the bed, a shuddering chill wracks his 
           body.

                                 WALSH
                        Right now.  Buy a water purification 
                        system.  A good one.  The best one we 
                        can afford - steal one of you have to.
                                 GUZMAN
                        ...Water purification?

                                 WALSH
                        For the village, their families.  
                        Fresh water and they’ll stay.

           Guzman looks down at him, a smile coming to his face.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Brilliant. Fucking brilliant, mate.

           Walsh rises, just slightly, but enough to be imploring.  A 
           moment of cold clarity, but his eyes are retreating.

                                 WALSH
                        There’s no more money, Mike.  If we’re 
                        gonna make this happen, it has to 
                        happen now.

           He passes out.  Guzman looks down at him.  Message received.

                                 WALSH
                        I spent the next 5 weeks in a malarial 
                        haze.  Mike kept the work going...and 
                        he kept me alive.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS: (1994)

           -- MUD FLIES as workers wrestle a DRILL into the ground.

           -- GUZMAN dabs a delirious WALSH with a cold cloth.

           -- HUGE SECTIONS OF CORES are CRUSHED in the SAMPLE SHED.

           -- SACKS are sealed with WAX.

           -- NATIVE VILLAGE -- pouring rain.  GUZMAN buys HERBS from a 
           tribal MEDICINE MAN.  He pays with GOLD DUST.  He TURNS and 
           sees something that stops him in his tracks -- 

           -- BEAUTIFUL NATIVE WOMAN(20’s) gorgeous, primitive, dressed 
           in native clothes, stares at Mike through the rain.  There’s 
           something secret and magical in her eyes -- sexual.  It’s like 
           they know each other.  They stare for a long moment.  

           The sound of an IGNITING FLAME...FUMMM! -- 

           -- A BUTANE FLAME -- GUZMAN brews the herbs.  He pours it into 
           a mug and forces WALSH to drink.  WALSH gags and SPITS IT OUT.
                                 GUZMAN
                        You want to live?  Get it down!

           Guzman holds the cup and Walsh chokes down the remedy.

           -- AT THE DOCKS -- GUZMAN and WORKERS load more SAMPLE SACKS 
           onto a boat.

           -- GUZMAN, covered in dirt and looking near dead, watches the 
           boat heading down river, the sky on fire with the last light 
           of day -- a last shot look in Guzman’s eyes.

           INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           WALSH’S HAND -- a cigarette smolders at the knuckle.

                                 WALSH
                        Five weeks I was in and out. I should 
                        have been dead.  Again.
                   (beat)
                        When the fever broke I got the news, 
                        the workers had stayed.

           Stay on his hand as he crushes out his smoke with finality.

           INT. BUSANG SITE - MAIN TENT - DAY (1994)

           Walsh sits up in bed, sipping more tea, weak but improving.  

           Guzman opens the flap and steps inside.  He’s holding a file.  
           MORE ASSAY REPORTS.  He looks at Walsh, unreadable.  

                                 WALSH
                        You gonna talk, or what?

                                 GUZMAN
                        We pulled seventeen more cores.

                                 WALSH
                        ...Assays?

           Guzman sits, exhausted, just shakes his head.  Tosses the 
           reports in Walsh’s lap.

                                 GUZMAN
                        No good.

                                 WALSH
                        ...shit...

           Then, just as Walsh turns back the cover page of the report.
                                 GUZMAN
                        I would say more in the area of great.

           Walsh stops.  Looks up -- a beat.

                                 WALSH
                        Don’t fuck around, Mike.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Eighth of an ounce per ton.

           Walsh scans the reports, rising to his feet.

                                 WALSH
                        Eighth of an ounce per.
                   (realizing)
                        ...Holy fuck...

           Guzman smiles -- Walsh is in shock.

                                 GUZMAN
                        We’ve got a strike, David.

           Walsh, smiles, laughs, screams!

                                 WALSH
                        We’ve got ourselves a gold mine!

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - NIGHT

           POP!!!  Champagne sprays from the bottle as Walsh moves 
           through the crowd at the bar, filling everyone’s glasses.  

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        That moment, there’s no way I could 
                        possibly describe the feeling.

           The regulars are all here, sharing in Walsh’s victory.

                                 WALSH (V.O. (CONT’D)
                        It’s amazing how a little gold dust 
                        can change everything.  For better or 
                        worse, the ride had begun.  And what a 
                        fuckin’ ride...
           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - LATER

           The place is vibrating!  MUSIC OVER.  Walsh is with Bobbie 
           Burns and a few other Greenhorns’ regulars -- CONRAD (Connie) 
           WRIGHT(40’s) and SCOTTIE NEVINS(50’s) celebrating at the bar.

                                 WALSH
                        To the best sales team in the 
                        business, right here!  

           Connie Wright raises a glass.  

                                 WRIGHT
                        You’re a stand up guy, Dave-o.

                                 NEVINS
                        To sharing the wealth.

           They clink glasses and drink deeply --”Sharing the wealth!”

                                 WALSH
                        It’ll be straight commission to start, 
                        but this hook’s got meat on it.  
                        There’s money out there, so reel it 
                        in.

           They throw back the rest of what’s in their glasses.  Walsh 
           leans over and whispers to Bobby Burns.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        This stock’s gonna start cooking, you 
                        sell a little here and there.  You 
                        hear me?  Don’t wait.  Think rainy 
                        day, Bobby boy.

                                 BOBBY BURNS
                        I’m with you, Davy - all the way. 
                        Cheers. 

           They drink -- Kay comes up and pulls Walsh gently by his arm.

                                 KAY
                        I’m stealing him from you, gentlemen.

           Walsh sheepishly walk, the music changes to a slow song...

                                 KAY (CONT’D)
                        You haven’t said more than two words 
                        to me all night so, for your sins, 
                        you’re dancing with me.

                                 WALSH
                        Kay?...
           But his protest melts away under her gaze.  Instead he kisses 
           her and allows himself to be led to the dance floor.  They 
           dance close, Kay’s eyes locked on his, a smile on her lips.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        So, what do you think?

                                 KAY
                        I think you’re a better dancer than 
                        you’re letting on.

           What the hell, he gives her a little turn -- she laughs in

                        None of this means anything without 
                        you. You know that, right?

                        I love you, too, David.

           A sweet moment of connection.  He kisses her -- a great kiss.  
           But the moment is short lived.  They’re interrupted by Bobbie 
           Burns who has someone to introduce to Walsh.

                                 BURNS
                        David, this is Walt Kealer, he 
                        publishes that investor magazine, The 
                        Gold Digger, I told you about.

                                 WALSH
                        Right.  Good to know you, Walt.

                        Double that with my newsletter.  
                        They’d love to know what you got 
                        cooking in Busang.  You got a minute, 
                        I’ll buy you a drink.

           That’s new -- someone buying him a drink.  He turns to Kay -- 

                                 WALSH
                        Baby, I’m gonna owe you that dance.   
                        You know I’m good for it.

           He leaves Kay with kiss on the cheek.  Kay watches, resigned 
           to the moment as David throws his arm around Kealer, steering 
           him to the bar.  Off Kay, ...where is this all going...?

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - WALSH’S BOOTH - MORNING

           The aftermath.  The juke box plays an old Hank Williams tune.  
           The bar is trashed, half-filled glasses, over-flowing 
           ashtrays, the smell of booze and stale smoke.

           Walsh has the place to himself.  He’s in the same clothes from 
           last night, working the phones as he sips his breakfast.

                        trust me, you’ll be thanking me.

           His other phone rings.

                        I gotta jump.

           He looks up as the front door opens.  Kay comes in wearing her 
           waitress uniform.  He picks up his other phone.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Lou, let me try you right back.

           He hangs up, greeting Kay with a smile.

                        We wrapped it up around four, I 
                        figured I’d stick around and catch the

           Walsh pulls her into the booth next to him.
                                 WALSH
                   (arm around her shoulder)
                        I want you to picture the greenest 
                        meadow you can imagine - blue skies 
                        and a fresh mountain  breeze.  Now 
                        take a big deep breath, Kay... Are you 
                        there?

                                 KAY
                   (like she’s praying)
                        ...I’m there.

                                 WALSH
                        When we’re really there, I’ll sleep.  
                        Okay?

           A kiss, which she reluctantly accepts -- he’s been drinking 
           and smoking all night and he looks like the walking dead.

                                 KAY
                        I brought you some clean clothes.

           Walsh looks puzzled for a beat, then he checks his watch.

                                 WALSH
                        Right, gotta go! 

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Walsh does his sink bath routine again.  The snap of a clean 
           shirt and a shot of Binacca takes us --

           INT. COLSON & WELLS CAPITOL GROUP - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The scene of Walsh’s earlier humiliation now takes on a 
           decidedly different tone.

           Walsh is at one end of the table. CLIVE COLSON(70’s) is seated 
           opposite, flanked by Anderson and Stanton who don’t look 
           nearly as cocky as they did before.

                                 CLIVE
                        David, your father and I started out 
                        together in this business.  Hell, he 
                        put me in the business - but I don’t 
                        have to tell you that.

                                 WALSH
                        Dad always spoke well of you, Clive.

                                 CLIVE
                        Makes me glad to hear so.

                        David, I’d like to underwrite a 
                        private placement of Bre-X stock. I 
                        believe we can raise between two and 
                        three million dollars based on your 
                        current assay results.

           That’s a lot of money.  Walsh nods, not giving anything away.

                                 WALSH
                        Capital’s definitely top of the agenda 
                        right now.

                                 CLIVE
                        There’s a lot of sharks in the water 
                        you’re suddenly swimming in.  We’ve 
                        got history - you know me and I hope 
                        you know you can trust me.
                   (pause)
                        I only wish you brought this to me 
                        sooner, David - I could have helped 
                        you with the start up.

           Walsh locks eyes with Stanton -- a deer in the headlights -- 
           is he gonna rat him out?  Walsh drains his coffee, slides the 
           mug across the table to Stanton.

                                 WALSH
                        Top that off for me, will you?

           Stanton rises and exits with Walsh’s mug.  We follow him --

           INT. COLSON & WELLS CAPITOL GROUP - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Stanton walks like a condemned man to the kitchenette.  In the 
           background he can hear laughter coming from the conference 
           room.  He pours the coffee and heads back.

           INT. COLSON & WELLS CAPITOL GROUP - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONT.

           Stanton comes back in to find the group on their feet, Walsh 
           shaking hands with Clive Colson.

                                 CLIVE
                        Stanton.  Mr. Walsh has agreed to give 
                        us his business.  On one condition.

           Stanton blanches.  Here it comes.  Walsh is stone faced.

                                 WALSH
                        I want you to personally handle my 
                        account.  I need you to be available 
                        to me 24/7/365.

           Stanton is speechless for just a moment, but finds his voice.
                                 STANTON
                        Absolutely.  Yes.  Thank you.

           Clive slaps the stunned Stanton on the shoulder.

                                 CLIVE
                        Congratulations.  Seems you made quite 
                        an impression.

           A look between Walsh and Stanton -- a look of understanding.  
           Stanton is grateful, but also knows that Walsh owns him. 

                                 WALSH
                        It’s gonna be a wild-ass ride.  You 
                        ready for that?

                                 STANTON
                        Yes, sir.

                                 WALSH
                        Then what the fuck are we standing 
                        here for?  Let’s make some money.

                        David!  You have to take this.

           Walsh emerges from the head, zipping up his fly.

                                 WALSH
                        Can’t a guy take a leak?

           Kay’s expression tells him it’s serious.  He takes the phone.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        This is David Walsh.

           INT. J.P. MORGAN CHASE - CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME TIME

           Bianccini, looking over the sparkling skyline.

                                 BIANCCINI
                        Mr. Walsh.  This is Frank Bianccini, 
                        J.P. Morgan Chase.

                                 WALSH
                        No shit?

                                            SMASH TO:

           NEW YORK CITY seen from the window of a First Class seat.

           INT. AIRLINER - FIRST CLASS - DAY

           Walsh sips his free booze, taking in the awesome view.  Kay is 
           at his side, looking a little overwhelmed in her new dress -- 
           trying to look ready for the big city.  He feels her looking 
           at him.  He turns and meets her eyes -- this is big for them.  
           Maybe too big...

           He slips her hand in hers -- a reassuring squeeze and we go --

           INT. AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - LATER

           Mike Guzman is chatting up a hot Asian FLIGHT ATTENDANT.  She 
           writes her number on a card and gives it to him.  
           She leaves him with a kiss on the cheek and Guzman turns to 
           see Walsh and Kay approaching.  Walsh greets him with a 
           knowing smile.  His eyes follow the flight attendant.

                                 WALSH
                        Looks like you had a good flight.

                                 GUZMAN
                        First class on someone else’s dime?  
                        Yeah, I had a great flight.  Nice 
                        suit.

           Walsh holds up a sleeve -- hemmed with a safety pin.

                                 WALSH
                        Picked it up on the way to the 
                        airport.

           They laugh.  Guzman is put together as always and there’s a 
           flicker of recognition between them -- even in his best suit, 
           Walsh doesn’t look anywhere near ready for prime time.  Kay 
           picks up on this.

                                 KAY
                        You both look great.  You’re gonna be 
                        great.

           Just then a voice turns them around.

                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Walsh?  Mr. Guzman?

           A uniformed driver, holding a sign with “Walsh / Guzman” 
           written on it.  Walsh, Guzman and Kay exchange little smiles.

                                 WALSH
                        Yeah, I could definitely get used to 
                        this.

           EXT. OFFICE TOWER - DAY

           A limousine pulls to the curb and the Driver comes around to 
           let Walsh and Guzman out.  Walsh leans back into the car.

                                 WALSH
                        Do some shopping.  Anything you want. 
                        I’ll see you back at the hotel.  Have 
                        fun.

                                 KAY
                        Good luck, David.
           A kiss and Walsh closes the door.  He and Guzman turn and 
           stare up at the office tower -- wow.  A look between them.  A 
           deep breath and we go...

           INT. J.P. MORGAN CHASE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Walsh and Guzman at the table with Bianccini, Dresher and the 
           other BOSSES and, in this rarefied air, even Guzman looks a 
           bit overwhelmed.  Walsh is out of his depth, mid-pitch...

                                 WALSH
                        We’ve got a private placement in play 
                        right now that’s fifty percent 
                        subscribed - off our current assay 
                        estimates. The numbers keep coming in 
                        good - and they will - the sky’s’ the 
                        limit on this thing.

           An awkward beat.  Bianccini steps up, he’s sophisticated, 
           confident. 

                                 BIANCCINI
                        You don’t need to sell us, Mr. Walsh.  
                        We’ve already done the math.  We want 
                        to take you to the big leagues. To do 
                        that we need the big money guys on 
                        board - the hedge funds and the mutual 
                        fund managers, big pension 
                        administrators.  These guys aren’t 
                        going to be impressed with a song and 
                        dance.

           Okay, that was a a little harsh.  But, Walsh doesn’t even 
           blush at the obvious implication.

                                 BIANCCINI (CONT’D)
                        ...They want to see a serious 
                        businessman with a serious plan to 
                        turn your promising lab results in a 
                        volatile market, in a volatile country 
                        into something they can stake their 
                        reputations on.

                                 WALSH
                        That’s not gonna be a...

                                 BIANCCINI
                   (cutting him off)
                        ...The problem we have is that you, 
                        neither of you, have ever taken a gold 
                        find - or any other find, for that 
                        matter - all the way to production.

           Suddenly Walsh is beginning to feel a little pushed.
                                 WALSH
                        Wait a minute...

                                 BIANCCINI
                        All I’m suggesting is we need to be 
                        smart about how we present this.

                                 WALSH
                        And when’s the last time you set one 
                        of your Gucci loafers down in a 
                        goddamn hole?  

           Frank fires back, calm, in control.  

                                 BIANCCINI
                        I’ve run one of the biggest minerals 
                        departments on Wall Street for the 
                        last six years, Mr. Walsh.

                                 WALSH
                        You ever even seen a real rock?  And I 
                        don’t mean the kind you shove up your 
                        nose!

           Bianccini smiles.  Unflappable. Dresher steps up.

                                 DRESHER
                        Okay, let’s pull it back a notch, 
                        gentleman.

           Everyone takes a beat.  The tension in the room is thick.  And 
           then from other end of the table, Mike Guzman begins to 
           speak...

                                 GUZMAN
                        There’s something about gold you can’t 
                        explain with words.

           All turn to Guzman.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got to get the taste of it on 
                        your tongue - the feel of it, gritty 
                        and electric between your fingers - 
                        and when you do, it’s like a drug.  
                        You’re hooked.

           He’s got their attention -- Guzman is mesmerizing.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        David and me, we’re prospectors. 
                        Wildcatters.  We roll up our sleeves, 
                        we slog around in the mud and we dig.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        Come hell or high water, and believe 
                        me we’ve seen plenty of both, we get 
                        it done. 

           The room sees Guzman look at Walsh.  A declaration of 
           friendship.  And faith.  An endorsement.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        Put together your hedge fund boys, 
                        whoever you need.  We’ll take them 
                        into the bush, up the river to Busang.  
                        They’ll see what they need to see. 

           Looks all around, landing on Bianccini... That’s just too damn 
           intriguing an offer to pass on.  Off his look, we go...

           INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           Jennings, jacket off, sleeves rolled up, pushes for clarity.  

                                 JENNINGS
                        So, it was Guzman who proposed the 
                        Junket to Busang...?

           Walsh drains his drink.  Rattles the ice in the empty glass.  
           Slowly sets it on the table -- like moving a chess piece.

                                 WALSH
                        It was a genius move.  Wish I had 
                        thought of it.  Let’s face it, I don’t 
                        exactly cut the right figure in a Wall 
                        street boardroom.  They didn’t like my 
                        suit or the smell of my whiskey in 
                        their hallowed halls -- but they could 
                        sure smell money.  With that one move, 
                        Mike shifted the balance of power.  
                        They were coming to our house -- and 
                        that was a whole new ball game.

           INT. JAKARTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY (1994)

           Walsh leads a group of BANKERS out of the terminal.  Three 
           we’ll get to know, BINKERT and JACKSON (30’s), OWENS(40).  
           These are men set free from the concrete jungle, ready for a 
           taste of the real thing.  They all pull wheeled carry-ons, 
           some dressed in the latest in safari-wear from Ralph Lauren.

           They’re met by Mike Guzman, in full bush gear -- two-day 
           scruff -- looking like something out of a David Lean film.  
           Suddenly the bankers’ outfits look foolishly ersatz.

                                 WALSH
                        Gentlemen, I’d like to introduce your 
                        guide, Mike Guzman.
                                 GUZMAN
                        Anyone who wants to turn back should 
                        do it now -- this is your last chance.

           They all look at him -- is he fucking kidding?...

                                 WALSH
                        He’s messin’ with you, come on.

           Guzman smiles.  A few of the Bankers sigh, some aren’t sure.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Welcome to Indonesia, boys.

                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. BUSANG RIVER - DAY

           Guzman pilots a skiff up river.  It’s one of those perfect 
           tropical day -- a balmy breeze, glorious sunshine and 
           billowing clouds hanging in an impossibly blue sky.

           Walsh gives the Bankers the tour -- as they pass a group of 
           tribesmen panning the river.

                                 WALSH
                        ...These guys have been panning this 
                        river for five thousand years.  That’s 
                        how it got it’s name...

           He shoots a look to Guzman, making the Bankers wait for it...

                                 GUZMAN
                        ...“Busang.”  It means, the river of 
                        gold.

                                 OWENS
                   (skeptical)
                        ...That’s not real?

           The group looks on in amazement.

                                 WALSH
                        Would I lie to you?

           A smile between Walsh and Guzman -- this is the show and 
           they’re loving it. 

           EXT. BUSANG SITE - DAY

           -- A BULLDOZER CLEARS A SECTION OF JUNGLE -- a crew works a 
           DRILL RIG.  Guzman shouts over the din, machete in his hand.
                                 GUZMAN
                        ...When we get a hit, we step out our 
                        drilling in a radiating pattern and 
                        keep going until we come up with a 
                        definitive picture of what’s down 
                        there -- this way we can map out the 
                        underlying geology, the dimensions of 
                        the vein, how long, how wide, what 
                        shape is it.

                                 BINKERT
                        And how deep can it go?

                                 GUZMAN
                        Let me show you.

           INT. BUSANG SITE - CORE SHED - DAY

           Guzman leads the group into the CORE SHED.  Throughout the 
           building, lying in wooden cradles, are the CORE SAMPLES -- 100 
           foot long cylinders of rock and earth.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Our typical drill depth is between 3 
                        and 5 hundred feet. We pull out our 
                        core samples in 100 foot segments - 6 
                        inches in diameter packed solid with 
                        rock and soil. 

           He moves to a massive work bench covered with crushed rock.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        The cores are delivered here where 
                        they’re prepared for shipping to the 
                        assay lab. 

                                 BINKERT
                        ...Assay?

                   (dubious of the process)
                        ...The “assaying” isn’t done here on

                        This building is guarded 24/7 and kept 
                        under lock and key.

           He pulls the chain around his neck from his shirt showing --

                        This is the key.

           With that he hoists up a diamond blade CIRCULAR SAW and it 
           hums to life.  He brings the blade down on the rock, 
           OBLITERATING the rock, and our hearing, as it cuts a 3 foot 
           section of core.  Again, he shouts over the noise --

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        The cores are cut into sections and 
                        then crushed! 

           He heaves the cut section into a CRUSHER which AUTOMATICALLY 
           ACTIVATES the mechanism -- adding insult to aural injury.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        The pulverized cores are then bagged 
                        and sealed!

           He produces a wax-sealed canvas sack as example, heaving it on 
           the ground -- it lands with a THUD at the Bankers’ feet.

           The Bankers nod, impressed.  But that’s not really what they 
           came all this way for.  They’re not quiet sold.
                                 WALSH

           Walsh and Guzman exchange a knowing look.

           Late afternoon sun filters through the deep canopy.  This 
           could be Eden.  A few of the Bankers, knee deep in the water, 
           pan the rocky bottom.  

                                 BINKERT
                        Son of a bitch.  No one’s gonna 
                        believe this shit.

           Owens swats at a bug the size of a golf ball.  He looks more 
           annoyed than impressed.

                                 OWENS
                        So, what do you think?

                        Not sure.  What about you?

           EXT. BANK OF THE RIVER - LATER

           Guzman tends a fire in a little clearing just off the water.  
           He reaches right into the flames, pulling out ROLLED BANANA 
           LEAVES, charred by the flame.  
           Several of the Bankers watch as he lays the rolled leaves on a 
           makeshift woven palm frond tray.

                                 GUZMAN
                        ...Anyone hungry?

           They’ve had a long day.  Hot, tired, ready for some food.  
           Guzman hands out the rolled leaves to the guys -- they open 
           the steamed banana leaves and their faces say it all --

                                 JACKSON

           Some of the Bankers freak, drop their food.  A few laugh.

           He rips off a leg and sucks back the juice.  Jackson gets 
           brave, decides to give it a try.

                                 JACKSON
                        It won’t make me hallucinate or

                        Never know.  You might get lucky.

           Owens, still working the river with Binkert, calls out!

                        Hey, come here -- check it out!

           Guzman leads the group out into the water to Owens.  Walsh 
           gestures to the pan.

                                 WALSH
                        Looks like it might be the stuff.

           Guzman holds the pan of mud up to the light -- glimmers of 
           gold are seen in the fading sun.

                        Give me a minute.
           The Bankers all watch, rapt -- Guzman takes the pan and moves 
           back to the river bank, dumps the mud into a waiting SLURRY.  
           He takes a bucket of river water and starts pouring the water 
           SLOWLY over the mud.  Then, right before their very eyes...

           -- a GOLD NUGGET appears!  About the size of a robin’s egg.  
           Guzman holds it up into the light -- it sparkles and shines.

                        A few more like that and you can pave 
                        Wall Street.

           The Bankers are fucking speechless.  Walsh looks at the 
           converted Owens...

           As the party trudges through this muddy shanty town, Guzman 
           pulls up alongside Owens and Binkert.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Hey, Owens.

           Guzman tosses Owens the golden nugget.  He fumbles it around 
           in his hands before he catches it.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        Give that to your lady and she’ll love

                                 OWENS
                        I’ll do that.

                        Seeing is believe, right boys?

           Owens and Binkert share a look -- did he hear them?  How?  As 
           they stare at Walsh, puzzled, maybe even impressed, Walsh just 
           keeps walking, a knowing smile on his face.

           NAKED INDONESIAN GIRLS dance to bad 80’s rock.  It’s Walsh,

                                 GUZMAN
                        ...it’s called a convex dome - it’s 
                        what every geologist dreams of finding 
                        and that’s what I think we’ve got at 
                        Busang.

           Walsh jumps in, putting it in layman’s terms.

                                 WALSH
                        Basically, it’s a volcano that’s 
                        collapsed in on itself, forming an 
                        inverted shell...
                   (cupping his hands)
                        ...or a bowl full of all the stuff 
                        we’re looking for.

                        How much “stuff” you think we’re 
                        talking about?

           They turn to Guzman.  He finishes his drink, taking his time.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Our current assays point to a deposit 
                        of anywhere from 10 to 35 million 
                        ounces.  When we find the dome - and 
                        we will find it - I wouldn’t be 
                        surprised if we prove 80 to 100 
                        million ounces.

           Jackson still has the presence of mind to do some calculations 
           on his PDA calculator.  He looks at the number.

                                 JACKSON
                        ...Is that right?
           He re-does the calculations.  They all wait.  He looks again.

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        You’re talking over 30 billion 
                        dollars. 

           They all freeze.  Even Walsh pauses before raising his glass.

                                 WALSH
                        May we all be in heaven an hour before 
                        the IRS knows we’re dead. 

           They laugh and right on cue, out come the girls.  Hot.  Asian.  
           Two for each banker.  As one of the girls runs her fingers 
           through Jackson’s hair, her breasts pressing against his face, 
           he turns to Owens...

                                 JACKSON
                        The business trips are going to be

                        Hell of a write off.

           Walsh watches, as the magic takes hold -- he turns to Guzman.

                                 WALSH
                        Not a bad day.

                        Nice little piece of luck, right?

           Guzman smiles.  He almost, but doesn’t quite, wink.  And as 
           the party rages we go...

                        Yeah, it’s probably pretty early.

           Walsh stares out at the city, his eyes wet with tears, 
           slurring his words.  He wobbles close to the rail.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        They’re all in, Kay. This is 
                        everything we’ve been waiting for.

                                 KAY
                        Oh, David, that’s fantastic - I knew 
                        you would do it.

                                 WALSH
                        Meet me in New York.  I’m leaving 
                        tomorrow.  I’ll send you some 
                        checkers.

                        Okay, I think you mean a ticket and 
                        that’s fine.  What’s going on?

                                 WALSH
                        Just come, okay?
                                 KAY
                        There’s so much going on with the 
                        house.  And we’re spending way too 
                        much money.

                                 WALSH
                        Just sell it.

                                 KAY
                        What?  No.  It’s going to be so nice.  
                        I just ordered some pretty tile for 
                        the bathroom and...

                                 WALSH
                        ...Sell it Kay.  Sell it and let’s 
                        start looking on the mountain.  

           Walsh slips a little and almost goes over the railing 
           backward, again dangerously close --

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Find us the land with the meadow and a 
                        lake and the peace and quiet -- you 
                        know what the fuck I’m talking about.  
                        Someplace beautiful?

           This hits Kay -- this is what she’s been dreaming of.

                                 KAY
                        Are you sure?

                                 WALSH
                        Am I sure about what?  That I love 
                        you?  Fuck yes, I’m sure.

           Kay smiles, like she’s about to cry. Walsh leans WAY BACK on 
           the rail, another fraction and this guy’s going off a 
           thirtieth floor balcony.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Just pack a bag!

                                 KAY
                        Okay. I’ll be there.

           ON KAY -- a long beat.  Silence on Walsh’s end of the line.

                                 KAY (CONT’D)
                        David?  Are you there?

           ON THE RAIL -- NO WALSH!  JUST A COLD WIND.  IS HE GONE?  We 
           pull back and see --
           -- Walsh, stretched out on a lounge chair, his eyes closed, 
           his drink falls from his hand.  CRASH!  SHATTERING ON THE 
           DECK.  Walsh doesn’t move.  Kay can hear the crash!

                                 KAY (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god!  DAVID!

           Then, after another long beat, Kay hears...SNOOORRRE!  A 
           little smiles comes over her face.

                                 KAY (CONT’D)
                        David...

           Off Kay, as Walsh snores away, we go...

           INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL - LOBBY BAR - DAY

           Back in civilization, the bankers are scrubbed clean.  They’re 
           gathered around Walsh at the bar, bloody Mary’s all around.  A 
           liveried BELL BOY approaches with their bags.

                                 BELL BOY
                        Gentlemen, your cars are ready.

           Owen raises his glass.  A final toast.

                        To all that glitters.

                        To Bre-X.

           They all clink glasses.  Down their drinks and begin gathering 
           their bags.  Owens shakes Walsh’s hand.

                                 OWENS
                        We’ll see you in New York.

                                 WALSH
                        You know you will.

           As they head for the exit, Binkert looks at Walsh. 

                                 BINKERT
                        What about Guzman?  He’s not missing 
                        the show, is he?

                                 WALSH
                        Someone’s got to mind the fort.  He’ll 
                        be back at the site, soon as he takes 
                        care of the bar tab.
           Walsh laughs and as MUSIC COMES UP, we...

           A golden light streams in through a batik-shaded window.

           same girl he saw that rainy day in the village.  A wholesome, 
           exotic beauty... 

           She lies comfortably in his arms, he kisses her.  She smiles 
           as Mike whispers something that makes her smile.  Like he just 
           told her a secret.  They seem happy, like they could be 
           together forever.  And maybe they will.  As the music builds.

           Kay is at the reception desk.  A CLERK assists her.

           Kay walks up to Walsh’s door.  She straightens herself and 
           knocks, no answer.  She knocks again -- then she remembers her 
           key.  She opens the door and moves...

           She slowly walks down the suite’s hall entry, a little nervous 
           about what she might find.

                                 KAY (CONT’D)
                        David are you here?

           She rounds a corner that opens into the main room of the suite 
           -- and there, sitting in the middle of the room in a beautiful 
           chair, is David Walsh.  

           New suit, nice cigar, he looks fantastic.  It’s like he’s 
           there to show Kay how he’s improved himself. 

                                 WALSH

           Kay can’t believe what she sees.  The place is decked out in 
           vases -- packed with hundreds of YELLOW ROSES.  

                                 KAY

           He gets up and moves to her.
                                 WALSH
                        I wanted to see you smile, Kay.  I 
                        wanted you to see that this broken 
                        down old prospector still has a little 
                        sugar left in him.

           He holds his hands up to show her.

                                 WALSH
                        I had my nails done.

           He moves over, she takes his hand.  She kisses him.  A great 
           kiss.

                        Well, I think your clothes on the 
                        floor would look even better.

           She smiles, he kisses her.  As they start to make love we 
           begin to hear, noise, shouting, laughter, energy...

           Behind them, Bianccini and OTHERS are hurriedly escorted down 
           the hall by NYSE OFFICIALS.  As they walk, we begin to hear 
           more NOISE AND SHOUTING, getting louder, it’s like some wild 
           sporting event is happening right above them --
           They start up a set of stairs -- we follow them as they

           APPLAUSE takes us...

           INT. PER SE RESTAURANT - NEW YORK - NIGHT

           Walsh, Kay, Bianccini’s crew and the BANKERS from the junket 
           sit at a large table in a private dining room.  Laughter and 
           applause as champagne cascades down a flute pyramid.  

           A team of waiters swoop in and pass out the perfectly filled 
           flutes.  Bianccini leads the toast --

                                 BIANCCINI
                        To a very good day.  For all of us.  
                        To David Walsh -- and to Mike Guzman, 
                        wherever he may roam.
           “Here, here.”  Walsh makes a show of downing his glass in one 
           gulp, holding it to a waiter for a refill.

                                 WALSH
                        Fill ‘er up and keep it flowing.

           JACKSON is back to crunching numbers on his PDA CALCULATOR.

                                 BANKER
                        David, try this on for size.  As of 
                        the closing bell this is what you’re 
                        worth on paper - you and Mike, both.

           He slides the calculator across to Walsh.  We don’t see the 
           number, we just see his reaction -- EVERYTHING GOES SLOW,  
           then...SILENT...Like he just slipped into a dream. 

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        ...And just like that, I was richer 
                        than God.

           He takes in the moment... Then, Kay kisses him and THE SCENE 
           ERUPTS.  The spell broken -- we’re back to real time.

                                 KAY
                        Oh my God, David!

           But Walsh’s eyes are now on the MODEL/DATE of the one of the 
           Bankers sitting across the table.  Her eyes are locked on 
           Walsh like a money-seeking missile.  He slides the calculator 
           back to Jackson, commenting to Jackson’s wife.

                                 WALSH
                        He sleep with that thing, or what?

                                 JACKSON’S WIFE
                        He sets it on vibrate and we’re both 
                        happy.

           Everyone laughs.  Walsh glances at the MODEL.  Her eyes are 
           still right there.  We can see David’s deep breath -- this is 
           gonna be trouble.  Don’t think Kay doesn’t notice.

           MUSIC up -- everything plays in and out of the music, snippets 
           of conversation, jumbled and blurred, through the haze and 
           laughter of too much booze.
           -- PLATES ARE CLEARED -- another course of outrageously 
           delicious food is served.

           -- DRINKS ARE POURED -- and downed.

           -- WALSH -- a sheen of sweat on his forehead, into one his 
           classic bad jokes, all eyes on him, especially the Model’s.

                                 WALSH
                        ...he’s a little guy, like 5’3’’ or 
                        so, 130 pounds and he’s got those real 
                        little tiny running shorts on and when 
                        he stands up we all notice he’s got 
                        what looks like a giant python living 
                        in there...     

           Walsh points to his crotch.  They all laugh.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        And he’s leaning in towards me to make 
                        sure I see it.  And EVERYBODY sees it!

           Everyone laughs again.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Then some lady across the pool - and I 
                        swear this really happened- she 
                        screams out, “My God look at that 
                        guy’s cock!”  

           The place erupts!!!

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Hell, you can’t blame him.  If I owned 
                        that thing I’d be walking around with 
                        it on a leash!  

           And he brings the house down!  The model, laughing, reaches 
           across the table and clutches his arm. 

           -- KAY finishes her wine.  Her glass is re-filled.

           -- WALSH crushes out a smoke, a waiter replaces the ashtray as 
           David lights another.  The model catches his eye, holding out 
           a hand.  He gives her a smoke...

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m Rachel.  It’s a pleasure to meet 
                        you, David. 

           ...and lights it.  Their eyes connect.
           UNDER THE TABLE -- A SEXY SLING-BACK PUMP on a slender 
           manicured foot -- we watch as, slowly, the pump slides from 
           the foot and falls to the floor.  

           KAY stands, leans over Walsh, extending her hand to Rachel.

                                 KAY
                        Hello, I’m Kay.

                                 RACHEL
                        Hello, Kay.

                                 WALSH
                        This is Kay, say hello to Rachel.

                                 KAY
                        I just did, David. 

           An awkward beat.  

                                 KAY (CONT’D)
                   (back to Walsh)
                        I’m going to the bathroom - and then I 
                        want to go.

           Kay moves off.  UNDER THE TABLE, Rachel slides her foot under 
           the cuff of Walsh’s pants leg.  Off his expression, we...

                                             CUT TO:

           INT. PER SE RESTAURANT - WOMAN’S RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kay dabs her face with water, trying to keep it together.  She 
           re-applies a little makeup, feeling in way over her head.  

           Two upper west side WOMEN walk in and move right past her.  
           They don’t say a word -- they don’t have to.  The looks, the 
           body language says it all -- Kay just does not belong here.

           She looks at herself in the mirror -- tries to put on a brave 
           face and we go... 

           EXT. PER SE RESTAURANT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Kay moves down the hall, about to turn the corner when she 
           hears familiar voices coming from the bar.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        ...The guy’s a fucking buffoon.  Tell 
                        me why I’m not taking my profits and 
                        getting out now?
           Kay peers around the corner -- it’s Frank Bianccini.  He’s 
           talking to one of the Bankers, ERIC HOLDER (40’s).  They’re 
           standing at the bar.  Kay stays out of site, listening.

                                 BIANCCINI
                        Look, we know, he’s a joke - but he 
                        happens to be a very lucky joke.  That 
                        doesn’t mean we’re gonna let him run a 
                        multi-billion dollar company, but 
                        you’re gonna have to sit tight, 
                        alright?

                                 ERIC
                        He’s out, that’s a guarantee?

                                 BIANCCINI
                        No-brainer from day one.

                                 ERIC
                        You give me your word?

                                 BIANCCINI
                        I’m gonna screw you on this?  I lose 
                        your fund that’s half my business.

           Eric likes the flattery.  He pokes Bianccini’s chest in a mock 
           threat that barely masks the real threat he’s conveying.

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t forget it.

                                 BIANCCINI
                   (smiling)
                        Fuck you.

           With an arm around Eric’s shoulder, Bianccini leads him back 
           to the table.  KAY WAITS A BEAT -- then follows at a distance.  

           INT. PER SE RESTAURANT - DINNING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           As Kay approaches the table she stops short.  The flirting is 
           heating up.  The model catches sight of Kay and makes a show 
           of disengaging.  Walsh turns, smiling sheepishly. 

           Kay walks up, picks up her bag.

                                 KAY
                   (to a Waiter)
                        My coat please.

                                 WALSH
                        ...come on, babe, one more drink.
                                 KAY
                        Stay if you want. I’m going.  

           Kay holds his gaze a beat, then heads for the door....

                                             CUT TO:

           INT. ST. REGIS HOTEL - NEW YORK - NIGHT

           Kay walks in -- Walsh does his best to keep up with her.

                                 KAY (cont’d)
                        ...I don’t want to talk about it!

                                 DAVID
                        I wasn’t doing anything!

                                 KAY
                        I was sitting right next to you!

                                 DAVID
                        Are you serious?  That girl?  She’s a 
                        gold digger, you don’t think I see 
                        that?!

                                 KAY
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay - well maybe I should have just 
                        fucked her right there on the table!  
                        At least I’d have gotten something out 
                        of it, right?  A little flirtation and 
                        you’re off the handle?!

                                 KAY
                        You think that’s what’s bothering me?  
                        Really?  You’re too drunk to get it up 
                        anyway.

                                 DAVID
                   (hurt)
                        Jesus, Kay?...

                                 KAY
                   (cutting him off; pissed)
                        It’s not the flirting, David - it’s 
                        the whole thing.  How you’re being... 
                        You’ve got your head so far up your 
                        ass you can’t see what a fool they’re 
                        making of you.
                                 WALSH
                   (stung)
                        What the hell does that mean?!

                                 KAY
                        They don’t like you, David!  They 
                        don’t want you - to them you’re just a 
                        hole in the ground full of their 
                        money.

                                 WALSH
                        Why can’t you just let me have this, 
                        Kay?  My whole life I’ve been waiting 
                        for this exact day and you can’t even 
                        give me this!

                                 KAY
                        You want me to be blind, David?  I 
                        won’t do that!  You can’t even see 
                        what’s happening!

                                 WALSH
                        How the hell do you know what I see?  
                        Why can’t you believe in me - just 
                        once?

                                 KAY
                        I’ve spent years believing in you!

                                 WALSH
                   (with venom)
                        That’s a load of crap, Kay!  You’ve 
                        patted me on the back and whispered 
                        the encouraging words - but you’ve 
                        never believed in me.  Not ever. 

           This lands like a thunder clap.  Silence.  Then...

                                 KAY
                   (barely audible)
                        That’s not true...

                                 WALSH
                        You can’t even look at me.

           There’s a long beat.  A truth has been spoken that they can’t 
           retreat from.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D) (cont’d)
                        God!  Did it ever occur to you that 
                        maybe I know what I’m doing?  Did it 
                        even occur to you?  
                                 (MORE)

                        I’m not the sad drunk guy in the 
                        corner booth you’ve got to fix - and 
                        roll your eyes with your long-
                        suffering sighs...
                   (mocking)
                        ”Oh, whatever’s going to become of 
                        poor drunk David?!”  I’M NOT A LOSER, 
                        KAY!

                                 KAY
                        ...David...

                  WALSH
                                         KAY
                                I don’t think that’s all I’m 
                                worth!
           I did this.  This is who I am!  
           You want to keep living in 
           shit?  That’s ‘cause that’s 
           all you think you’re worth!... 

                                 WALSH
                        ...But don’t you tell me I’m not good 
                        enough.  God damn it, don’t you tell 
                        me that!

           Kay’s eyes brim with tears.

                                 KAY
                        I love you, David.  But they’re gonna 
                        break your heart.

           A beat.  Walsh goes, suddenly, ice cold.

                                 WALSH
                        Well no one said you have to stick 
                        around to watch.

           ...And the tears spill over and run down Kay’s cheeks.  She 
           silently turns and walks out.  

           Walsh wheels around, SCREAMING at the door, kicking over a 
           room service tray!

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        FUCK YOU, KAY! GO! FUCK YOU!

           He picks up a chair heaves it across the room -- vases and 
           yellow roses shatter and go flying all over the room.

                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - DUSK

           The beaches of the south shore glow pink as the CHASE 
           CORPORATE CHOPPER races away from the setting sun.
           In VOICE OVER, the interview continues --

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        Looking back, saying what I said to 
                        Kay was maybe the meanest thing I ever 
                        said to anyone.  It felt like a tree 
                        had landed on me.  Like I was buried 
                        alive under the full weight of the 
                        earth.
                   (beat, then...)
                        But, of course, she was right...

                                       INTERCUT WITH: 

           INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

                                 JENNINGS
                        Did you?

                                 WALSH
                        Did I what?

                                 JENNINGS
                        Know what you were doing?

           Walsh just stares at him, a wry smile.

                                 WALSH
                        Isn’t that what you’re here to find 
                        out?

           Jennings takes a breath.

                                 JENNINGS
                        So, Kay did what?  Went back to Reno?

                                 WALSH
                        You know how they smelt gold?  1,971 
                        degrees Fahrenheit.  Fire is what 
                        makes things strong. I’ve been in the 
                        fire, Jennings.  

                                 JENNINGS
                        So, you let her go?

           Walsh takes a deep pull on his whiskey.  The pain is clear in 
           his bloodshot eyes, but he puts on that smile, trying, 
           unsuccessfully to cover.

                                 WALSH
                        For one, you didn’t see the girl.

                        I was on the mountaintop.  Hell if I 
                        wasn’t gonna enjoy the view.

           Walsh give an empty smile as the chopper arcs in low, setting 
           down on a vast lawn just beyond the dunes.

           EXT. STAGGERING HAMPTON’S ESTATE - NIGHT (1994)

           This place would make Gatsby blush -- lit up like a ship at 
           sea.  The thumping music invites us...

           INT. ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           A party in full swing.  Walsh is led around by Bianccini, who 
           makes introductions to the HEAVY HITTERS in attendance.

                                 HEAVY HITTER
                        ...So how’s it feel, Mr. Walsh?

                                 WALSH
                        How’s what feel?

                                 HEAVY HITTER
                        To be a rock star?

                                 WALSH
                        Feels like I should be banging 
                        groupies, not chatting up bankers.

           Walsh laughs, slapping the guy’s shoulder and moving on.  
           Bianccini and the Hitter exchange a dismissive look before 
           Bianccini follows after David.

                                 BIANCCINI
                        David, come on. You gotta be nice to 
                        these guys. If this is gonna work 
                        we’re gonna need them. 

                                 WALSH
                        I’m gonna make these rich fucks a lot 
                        richer, Frank.  So, I’m thinking I’ve 
                        got a little leeway here, alright? 

           Bianccini nods, backing off.  Walsh heads off into the party.  
           The HEAVY HITTER steps up to Bianccini.

                                 HEAVY HITTER
                        Really?  That’s Walsh?  

                                 BIANCCINI
                        Try and look past the personality. Let 
                        the numbers do the talking.

                        me.

                                 HEAVY HITTER

                        Hope he enjoys the ride.

           EXT. ESTATE - PARTY - POOLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh moves to the bar.  People at the pool -- not exactly the 
           kind of party where people actually get into the water.

           EXT. ESTATE - POOLSIDE BAR - NIGHT

           The BARTENDER is about to take Walsh’s order, but a voice from 
           behind Walsh beats him to the punch.

                                 VOICE
                        Double Seagrams on the rocks.

           Walsh turns.  It’s RACHEL, the model from the restaurant.  She 
           smiles.  The Bartender reacts to the call liquor.

                                 BARTENDER
                        I have a nice selection of single 
                        malts, sir, if you’d prefer?

                                 WALSH
                        You heard the lady, and the rocks are 
                        optional.

           The Bartender looks at Rachel for her order.

                                 RACHEL
                        The same, thank you.

                                 WALSH
                        You sure you want to do that?  I mean, 
                        you don’t have to impress me.

                                 RACHEL
                        I was hoping I’d find you here.  How 
                        have you been, David?  

                                 WALSH
                        I feel like a million bucks only a few 
                        hundred times better.

           They both laugh, you can just see it in his eyes -- “My god, 
           what a piece of ass...” 

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        ...Hey, you want to get wet?
           EXT. ESTATE - HOT TUB - LATER

           Walsh and Rachel are in the hot tub, naked, laughing.  She 
           writhes around him, ready to steal his soul.  Folks stand off 
           enjoying the show. 

                                 WALSH
                        ...And she says, where the hell are 
                        you going?  And he says, I’m going to 
                        Las Vegas with you. I want to see how 
                        you live on 800 dollars a year!

           As they laugh, a VOICE cuts into the revelry.

                                 MUNK (V.O.)
                        David Walsh?

           Walsh disengages from Rachel’s tentacle-like limbs and looks 
           up at PETER MUNK(50’s).  One look at this guy and you know 
           he’s the man -- shock of silver, polished, a slight English 
           accent.

                                 MUNK (CONT’D)
                        I’m Peter Munk, Barrick Gold.  Seems 
                        I’ve caught you at a bit of a 
                        disadvantage, Mr. Walsh.

           Walsh doesn’t skip a beat.  He stands, steps out of the tub, 
           completely naked, his gut and all hanging out for all to see.

                                 WALSH
                        I don’t know about that.

           Walsh extends his dripping hand, which Munk, unflappable, 
           accepts with a smile.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Good to meet you.  This is Rachel.

                                 MUNK
                        It’s a pleasure, Rachel.

           David throws on a towel... sticks a stub in his mouth.

                                 WALSH
                        Mr. Munk controls more gold than 
                        anyone else on the planet. 

                                 MUNK
                        With the possible exception of Mr. 
                        Walsh.

           Walsh throws a wink at Rachel.
                                 WALSH
                        So, I guess you’re in the tub with the 
                        right guy.

           Rachel giggles, splashes him.  Walsh takes a moment, lighting 
           his smoke.  He looks over at a very patient Munk.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        So, this is how it happens?

                                 MUNK
                        This is how.

                                            SMASH TO:

           INT. ST. REGIS HOTEL - WALSH’S SUITE - NIGHT 

           Walsh has Rachel on all fours in a plush King size bed, 
           balling her brains out from behind. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes. Fuck me David!  Yes! Yes! Yes!!!

           Walsh reaches over -- never missing a stoke, and picks up his 
           drink.  He drains the glass and tosses it on the floor and 
           goes at it harder.  As the sex gets more intense we...

           PRELAP --

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        Have you lost your fucking minds?!  

                                            SMASH TO:

           INT. J.P. MORGAN CHASE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Munk and his lawyers are seated at one end.  Walsh’s bankers 
           at the other including Dresher and Owens.  No one is speaking, 
           they listen to the rant coming from the next room.

                                 WALSH (O.S.)
                        This isn’t a deal, it’s a goddamn 
                        rape!    

           INT. J.P. MORGAN CHASE - ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh paces like an animal.  His personal banker, Stanton, 
           looks on, shocked.  Bianccini tries to talk him down.

                                 BIANCCINI
                        David, just listen to me.
                                 WALSH
                        This is mine!  I found it, me and 
                        Mike. We were the ones up to our asses 
                        in shit and mud and this motherfucker 
                        offers a minority partnership?!  FUCK 
                        YOU!

           Bianccini stays cool, always reasonable.  Maddeningly so...

                                 BIANCCINI
                        David, it’s a tremendous amount of 
                        money.  You’ve done a great thing, a 
                        historic thing. But Munk has the 
                        resources and the expertise to bring 
                        this home. It’s time for you to sit 
                        back and enjoy your success.

                                 WALSH
                        Yeah, and maybe it’s time for you to 
                        sit back and fuck yourself!

           Stanton steps up for Walsh.

                                 STANTON
                        Frank, this deal is shit and you know 
                        it!  Come on?! 

                                 WALSH
                   (to Stanton, still pacing)
                        See, keep your friends close and your 
                        enemies closer - you fuck, Frank!  You 
                        FUCKING PUNK ASS FUCK!

           Bianccini has had enough. He goes icy calm.

                                 BIANCCINI
                        I’m sorry you feel that way, David, 
                        but this is the reality of your 
                        situation.  You don’t have a choice 
                        here, so sign the fucking deal and 
                        stop wasting my time!  

           This seems to stun Walsh, but for once, he doesn’t respond 
           right away.  He pulls a cigarette, pats himself for a light.

                                 WALSH
                        Anyone got a light?

           Stanton gets up and lights Walsh’s smoke.  Walsh takes a long 
           drag and looks at Frank, as cool as December.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        I want you to listen to me, Frank, 
                        very carefully.  Fuck you.

                        Now you tell that motherfucker he 
                        works for David Walsh.  Or he can go 
                        fuck himself, too.

           INT. J.P. MORGAN CHASE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The air has been sucked out of the room.  Munk simply turns to 
           one of his attorneys. 

                                 MUNK
                        We’re going to need to make some 
                        calls.

           Off Monk, if ever there was someone you didn’t want as an 
           enemy, we...

                        There’s the good - and there’s the 
                        fucked.  I didn’t quite know it yet, 
                        but we were good and fucked.

           carefully lowers the GOLDEN LETTERS of the BRE-X logo into 
           place on the building’s facade.

           A brand new silver Cadillac Seville pulls into a prime spot. 
           David Walsh gets out of the car and we go --

           The chaos of a recent move-in -- lots of busy employees.  The 
           elevators open and Walsh strides in.  He’s met almost 
           immediately by Bobby Burns and a few others.

                                 BURNS
                        Where the hell have you been?!  I’ve

                        going on, David.  What’s happening?

           Walsh sees the panic in everybody’s eyes.  Not good.
                                 WALSH
                        I don’t know.  Get Mike on the phone.  
                        Now.  Let’s go!

           of the gate.  Guzman speaks on a 90’s vintage Sat phone.

                                 GUZMAN
                   (into phone)
                        David!  They’re locking us out!

                                           INTER-CUT:

           INT. BRE-X HEADQUARTERS - WALSH’S OFFICE - SAME

           Walsh stands at his desk, smoking.

                                 WALSH
                        What?  What are you talking about?

                                 GUZMAN
                        They’re taking over. The military’s 
                        here - the Minister revoked our 
                        exploration permits.

           A terrifying realization begins to dawn on Walsh.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        What happened at your meeting with 
                        Munk?

                                 WALSH
                   (defensive)
                        They were trying to push us out, Mike.

                                 GUZMAN
                        David, what happened?!

                                 WALSH
                        They can’t revoke our permit! They 
                        can’t just steal it away from us!

           Guzman is livid, screaming as he’s herded onto a truck.
                                 GUZMAN
                        Of course they can!  I told you from 
                        the beginning - Suharto can do 
                        whatever he wants!

           David paces, he knows this could be the end.  

                                 WALSH
                        Oh, god... Oh, my god.

           The truck drives off -- Guzman watches as the dream slowly 
           starts to disappear into the distance.

                                 GUZMAN
                        You knew who you were dealing with.  
                        These are killers - Peter Munk the 
                        worst among them.  
                   (beat)
                        Jesus... What have you done, David?

           Walsh seems to physically crumble -- he buries his face in his 
           hand.  Completely at a loss.

                                 WALSH
                        I’m sorry, Mike.  Oh God, I’m sorry.

           INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT) 

           Walsh looks up at Jennings -- it’s not easy telling someone 
           what a fuck-up you are.  He’s embarrassed, the pain of the 
           moment, the booze, the miles, all fresh on his face.  

                                 WALSH
                        It turns out that, in addition to long-
                        standing business ties to Suharto, 
                        Barrick Gold has on its board a former 
                        Prime Minister of Canada and an ex-
                        president of the United States by the 
                        name of George Herbert Walker Bush.  
                        All Peter Munk had to do was pick up 
                        the phone and I was on the pavement.

           Jennings takes a thoughtful moment.  Then... 

                                 JENNINGS
                        This is troubling to me.  

                                 WALSH
                        Yeah - you ought to see it from my 
                        end.
                                 JENNINGS
                        You had to know, at least have some 
                        idea, and yet you fought to maintain 
                        control of the site against the advice 
                        of your bankers, against common sense 
                        business practice.  Why didn’t you 
                        take the deal?  Why was maintaining 
                        control so important?

                                 WALSH
                        If I took that deal they would have 
                        paid me off. Cut me out.  

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        You would have made more money than 
                        anyone could spend in three life 
                        times.  Generational wealth.

           Anger churns up from somewhere deep inside Walsh.

                                 WALSH
                        Busang would become a Barrick mine and 
                        Peter Munk’s Midas touch continues.  
                        And David Walsh?  He’s a fucking 
                        footnote - the lucky bastard who fell 
                        down drunk and found himself in a pile 
                        of money.
                   (beat)
                        Busang was mine.  There was no way I 
                        was just gonna let them take it.  At 
                        least that’s what I thought.  
                   (the pain again)
                        I just didn’t see Suharto coming.

                                             CUT TO:

           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE - RENO - DAY (1994)

           Walsh walks into his house, like he’s in shock.  He stands 
           there, taking in his world -- the remodel work on the house 
           still unfinished.  The emptiness of the place is oppressive.   

           He pulls a book of matches from the Vegas clown ash tray, 
           sitting there like an artifact from a different life.  He 
           lights a smoke, pulls a bottle of Seagrams from a cupboard. 

           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh stands at the closet, hoping beyond hope, and he opens 
           the door -- It’s like an empty casket.   In case he didn’t 
           realize it, he does in this moment -- Kay is gone.  Maybe the 
           only person in the world who loved him, understood him, is 
           really gone.  
           Her clothes, nick-knacks, everything that was hers that made 
           this little house a home.  Gone.  David stares out, he slumps 
           down to the floor and his eyes well with tears.  

           PRELAP --

                                 REPORTER
                        ...Major news on Wall Street.    Bre-X 
                        corporation stock was off nearly fifty 
                        points at the opening bell this 
                        morning on news of the Suharto 
                        government’s revocation of Bre-x’s 
                        exploration rights...

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - MORNING

           Walsh sits alone, unsteadily, at the bar.  He watches the CNBC 
           MARKET REPORT.  Roy watches Walsh with concern as he pours the 
           last shot from a bottle of Seagrams.

                                 CNBC
                        There is talk of a deal in place for 
                        Peter Munk and Barrick Gold to take 
                        over Bre-X’s holdings.  President and 
                        CEO David Walsh has not commented 
                        publicly on the news which is making 
                        an already shaky trading floor even 
                        more unstable.

           Walsh drinks.  Roy picks up the remote, about to flip...

                                 WALSH
                   (slurred; belligerent)
                        Leave it!
                   (re: the empty bottle)
                        I’m gonna need another.

                                 ROY
                        You need to go home, David.  

                                 WALSH
                        Yeah...Okay, Roy.  Make it one to go, 
                        then.

                                 ROY
                        I’m sorry.  I’ll call you a cab.

           Walsh just looks at Roy.  By the look on his face, this could 
           go bad.  But a smile comes to Walsh’s face as he slides off 
           the stool, wobbles on his feet.  It’s not a friendly smile.
                                 WALSH
                        Piece of advice, Roy - and you should 
                        take my word on this.  You ain’t the 
                        only game in town.

           And as he sways for the door, Roy watching him sadly, we...

           EXT. BRE-X HEADQUARTERS - AFTERNOON

           The late afternoon sun sets the gold BRE-X sign aglow.

                                 STANTON (V.O.)
                        None of which I really believe by the 
                        way...

           INT. BRE-X HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Burns and Connie, are listening to Stanton’s report.  Guzman 
           paces.

                                 STANTON
                        I stemmed the bleeding for now, but 
                        the bottom’s gonna fall out if we 
                        don’t come up with something.

                                 GUZMAN
                        What about New York, Bianccini, the 
                        bankers.  What do they say?

                                 STANTON
                        As far as they’re concerned, this just 
                        means they get to sell the deal all 
                        over again.  They make money coming 
                        and going, they don’t care.

                                 GUZMAN
                        That’s just beautiful.

           Just then, Scottie Nevins enters.

                                 NEVINS
                        I just talked to Roy at the Greenhorn.  
                        David was there all night - pretty 
                        rough.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NEVINS (CONT'D)
                        Roy said he left about 6 this morning.  
                        I swung by the house - he’s not there.

                                 GUZMAN
                        We have to find him. There’s still one 
                        more card we might be able to play.
                   (off their questioning 
                    looks)
                        Suharto’s son - he’s wanted in on this 
                        from the beginning. He may be able to 
                        help.

                                 STANTON
                        You think there may be a way to flank 
                        this whole thing?

                                 GUZMAN
                        More like a full frontal assault, but 
                        we have to find David now.

           Guzman, Burns and Stanton -- fan out across the city -- each 
           checking the BARS; seedy CASINOS and STRIP JOINTS of RENO.

           The SEQUENCE takes us from AFTERNOON to NIGHT and ends with 
           the NEON Gomorrah of downtown.

           INT. STRIP CLUB / BAR - NIGHT

           A barely standing, shirtless Walsh struggles in the arms of a 
           BOUNCER as he’s led from this shit hole of a bar.

           EXT. STRIP CLUB / BAR - CONTINUOUS

           As Walsh is thrown outside, he takes a lame swing at the 
           bouncer who just looks at him with a measure of pity.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Go home.  Sleep it off.

           Walsh makes like he’s going to reply, but can’t find the 
           words.  He staggers off down the sidewalk.  

           Up ahead, he sees a BANK OF PAY PHONES  A glint of focus seems 
           to come to his eyes and we go...
           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kay is asleep on a fold-out sofa bed in a crappy studio 
           apartment.  She’s awakened by the RINGING PHONE. 

           INTER-CUT WITH:

           WALSH AT THE PAY PHONE --

                                 KAY’S ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)
                        This is Kay, I can’t take your call 
                        right now.  Leave a message and I’ll 
                        call you back.  Bye.

           ON KAY -- silence on the line.  Then, “click.”

           WALSH -- he hangs up.  He has to steady himself as he fishes 
           out more coins.  He dials.

           ON KAY -- the phone rings again.  This time she turns on the 
           bedside lamp, sitting up listening.

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        Kay, it’s me.  Are you there?  If 
                        you’re there will you pick up?

           Hearing his voice hurts, but she’s not picking up.  

           Walsh is barely able to hold his head up, slogging through his 
           words.  

                                 WALSH (cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        Okay...guess you’re not home, then.  I 
                        was just calling to...I just wanted to 
                        hear your voice.  I screwed up, Kay, 
                        the whole thing, I screwed it up... 
                        You were right - I’m just not good 
                        enough.  I never have been...I just 
                        thought, maybe I could fake it, you 
                        know?...

           The line goes silent.  Kay looks stricken, but she fights the 
           urge to pick up.  

           Walsh leans his forehead against the phone -- drifted off for 
           a second.  He comes too with a start.

                                 WALSH (cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        Kay?  It’s me.

                        Okay, I’m gonna stop calling now. So 
                        you better get used to it.  I’m not 
                        calling any more, Kay.  
           Then... She quickly picks up just as Walsh hangs up.

                                 KAY
                        David?

           Too late.  Walsh staggers a few paces and tries to light a 
           cigarette.  He’s too fucked up to light up.  He throws it away 
           and turns back to the phone, searches around for change.  
           There’s no change.  He so drunk he talks anyway... 

                                 WALSH (cont’d)
                        Listen, please pick up.  Please, Kay.  
                        Please, pick up the phone.

           EXT. RENO NEVADA - MORNING - ESTABLISHING

           The city crawls to life.  Cars on the freeways.  Pedestrians 
           crowd the sidewalks.

           PRELAP --

                                 GUZMAN (V.O.)
                        David! David! Get up, David!

           EXT. STREET - MORNING

           Walsh is passed out by the pay phones, shirtless, covered in 
           his own vomit and piss.  Guzman and Bobby Byrns try to rouse 
           him.

           WALSH’S POV -- fast and blurry, coming out of his stupor, as 
           Guzman and Byrns try to pull him to his feet.  Passing 
           PEDESTRIANS gawk in disgust.

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                        ...Disgusting. Get that bum out here.

           Guzman jumps up -- gets in the guy’s face.

                                 GUZMAN
                        You got one second before I shove your 
                        head up your ass and roll you down the 
                        street.

           The guy hurries off.  Guzman goes back to Walsh.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        I got you, mate.

           A stunned look, the sun in his eyes, the sickness of booze. 
           All this on Walsh’s face takes us...
           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE - MORNING

           The door opens, Guzman and Byrns help Walsh inside.

                                 GUZMAN
                   (to Byrns)
                        I got him from here. Thanks.

           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A JET OF WATER -- Walsh lets out a SCREAM as Guzman shoves him 
           under the blast of COLD WATER.  Guzman pulls the shower 
           curtain closed for emphasis.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Use the soap, David!

           And as he exits the bathroom, we...

           INT. WALSH’S HOUSE / KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           A STREAM OF COFFEE pours from the maker into the pot.  It’s 
           only about half-full, but Guzman loses patience and pulls the 
           pot away.  Coffee sizzles on the hot plate.

           He pours out a mug full and we go...

           INT.  WALSH’S HOUSE / BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The shower is still running.  Guzman enters with the coffee.

                                 GUZMAN
                        How you doing in there?

           No answer.  Guzman pulls back the curtain to find Walsh 
           sitting on the shower floor, out cold.  Guzman shuts off the 
           water.  Shoves him awake with the toe of his boot.

                                 GUZMAN (cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        Wake up.
                   (nothing...)
                        Wake the fuck up. 

           A big kick.  Walsh opens his eyes, looks up at Guzman with 
           some returning clarity.  Guzman holds out the mug of coffee.

                                 GUZMAN (cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        Here, get this down.
           Walsh recoils.  Coffee’s not what he needs.  Guzman puts the 
           coffee down and has a seat on the toilet.  A LONG BEAT as the 
           two men just sit there.  Looking at each other. 

                                 WALSH
                        Kay won’t talk to me.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Smart woman.

                                 WALSH
                        I’m sorry, Mike.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Yeah, you said that.  So how about you 
                        pull your shit together now?  We’re 
                        getting on a plane this afternoon.

                                 WALSH
                        It’s over.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Like hell it is.  We lose control of 
                        the site now, everything we’ve set up, 
                        all our work - it’s gone.  We’re 
                        fucked.  With nothing.  Are you clear 
                        on that picture, mate?

                                 WALSH
                        What do you want me to do?  We lost!  
                        I lost!  I’m sorry!

           off your ass.
                                I can’t...

                                 GUZMAN
                        ...and fight!

                                 WALSH
                        I can’t!  I’m not that guy!  Kay was 
                        right!  Everybody was...

           Walsh looks up like a wounded child.  Guzman takes a breath. 

                                 GUZMAN
                        You don’t think I know what people say 
                        about you?  That you’re a drunk?  A 
                        fat piece of shit?

                                 WALSH
                        There’s that.
                                 GUZMAN
                        Tasteless.  Out of his league. Teller 
                        of bad jokes.  A fucking side show.

                                 WALSH
                        Alright.  Okay, I get the picture.

                                 GUZMAN
                        They think you’re a fool, David.  And 
                        if you just sit here feeling sorry for 
                        yourself doing nothing, well, then 
                        everything they say about you is going 
                        to be true.

           Beat.  It’s the moment of truth for David Walsh.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        When we started this thing, we were 
                        going to prove them all wrong, 
                        remember?
                   (then...)
                        I don’t think you’re a fool, David.

           Walsh looks at Mike -- his friend.

                                 WALSH
                        You’re my friend aren’t you?

                                 GUZMAN
                        No, I’m not.  You just got me to sign 
                        that goddamn napkin.

           They don’t exactly laugh, but there’s a smile.  Guzman picks 
           up the coffee mug.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        Now drink your coffee.

                                 WALSH
                        You know, people used to believe that 
                        if you got bit by a rabid dog, if you 
                        ate a hair of the dog that bit you - 
                        the rabies would go away.

           Guzman reaches into his pocket and pulls out a flask.  He 
           tilts a generous pour into the coffee mug.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        You are my friend.

           They look at each other -- they’re together in this.  David 
           takes another long drink as we go...

                        It seems Suharto had a son, his 
                        youngest, Hutomo - “Tommy.”  Bit of a 
                        fuck-up - a real problem for the old 
                        man.  I guess you could say, I could

                        Suharto had been trying get Tommy set 
                        up for years, but everything Tommy 
                        touched turned to shit.  Mike had some 
                        mutual friends from back in the day - 
                        we figured if we could bring Tommy on 
                        board as a partner, maybe he could get 
                        daddy to change his mind and swing 
                        things back our way.

           A massive estate.  Perfectly manicured Asian gardens. 
           Breathtaking plantation-style mansion. 

           Suharto’s son, “Tommy,” Walsh and Guzman sit in the garden 
           pavilion, aides on the perimeter.  Tommy looks every bit the 
           royal child -- impeccable suit, skin that glows.  He listens 
           impassively to Walsh, in full form, nailing the joke...
                                 WALSH

                        and the guys says no, I’m definitely 
                        buying a Cadillac.  I’m thinking about

           Walsh laughs!  Tommy looks at Guzman and then back at Walsh 
           who’s still laughing.  Guzman drops his head as we wait...

                        Cadillac is a pussy magnet.

           Tommy smiles, then laughs.  They all start to laugh.  Guzman 
           can’t believe it.

                                 WALSH
                        You like Cadillacs?

           INT. J.P. MORGAN CHASE - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Bianccini steps into his office where he finds Dresher waiting 
           for him.

                        Bre-X retains 15 percent of the find - 
                        the other 85 goes to the company of 
                        Suharto’s choosing - which just so 
                        happens to be owned by his son.  Walsh

                        We put a lot into this.  You 
                        understand.  A lot of big players. 

           Bianccini knows now he’s looking at the executioner.

                                 BIANCCINI
                        I’ll talk to the investors.  I can 
                        explain...

                                 DRESHER
                        I already did, Frank.
                                 BIANCCINI
                        Walsh won’t last.  They’re gonna need 
                        us.

                                 DRESHER
                        You’re gonna be fine, Frank. You’ll 
                        land on your feet.

           A long beat.  Dresher turns and starts out the door.  We stay 
           on Bianccini, stunned, in total shock.  The sound of a chorus 
           of voices rises, and we...

                                            SMASH TO:

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - NIGHT

           Walsh, Bobby Burns and the boys celebrate, singing along 
           drunkenly to some great rock song.  Booze and music and lots 
           of cigarettes and more booze!  Just like old times!  

           A TV is on above the bar.  Someone turns up the volume, 
           drawing everyone’s attention.

                                 CNBC
                        ...In our top money news, a story that 
                        is being compared to David toppling 
                        Goliath.  David Walsh, that is...  

           The crowd at the Greenhorn goes nuts!

                                 CNBC (CONT’D)
                        ...Bre-X Mineral Corporation has 
                        secured a deal with the Suharto 
                        government to retain control of their 
                        strike in Indonesia, fending off a 
                        hostile takeover by Barrick Gold.  
                        With Bre-X shares soaring on the news, 
                        insiders are calling the deal a shrewd 
                        and unprecedented move on the part of 
                        Bre-X CEO, David Walsh.

           The cheers from the Greenhorn crowd drown out the TV.

           ON WALSH -- draining a whiskey, center of attention, smiling 
           in triumph.  Everyone laughs and dances as the music comes 
           back up.  Stanton walks up to Walsh and pulls him aside. 

                                 STANTON
                        Hey, David.  Got a minute?

           Walsh looks at Stanton.  Whatever it is, it looks serious.

                                 WALSH
                        Sure.  Let’s go someplace quiet.
           David drains another drink and they head into...

           INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh washes his face, looks into the mirror at Stanton as he 
           dries off with a paper towel.

                                 WALSH
                        So, what’s up?

                                 STANTON
                        I just got a call.  

           Walsh freezes.

                                 WALSH
                        Is it Kay?

                                 STANTON
                        No.  It’s not.  I haven’t heard from 
                        Kay, David.  I’m sorry.  

                                 WALSH
                        Well, what is it, then?  Spill it.

           Stanton enjoys the moment.  Giving away nothing.  Then...

                                 STANTON
                        The National Association of 
                        Prospectors would like to honor you 
                        with a Golden Pick Axe.  

           ON WALSH -- he looks at Stanton, stunned.  Stanton smiles 
           warmly.  He knows how important this is to Walsh.

                                 STANTON (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been voted, by your peers, as 
                        “Prospector of The Year.”

           Walsh stares out in shock.  There, in the bathroom of the 
           Three Greenhorns, on a cold night in Reno Nevada and without 
           the love of his life, David Walsh has finally been accepted.

                                 WALSH
                        Prospector of The Year.  Really?

                                 STANTON
                   (beeming)
                        Yes, sir.

           Walsh leans against the wall -- he lowers his head.  Then, he 
           starts to cry.  It’s all too much.
                                 STANTON (CONT’D)
                        Congratulations, David.  You are 
                        officially the best miner in the 
                        world.

           We go tight on Walsh’s eyes, flooded with emotion.

                                 WALSH
                        Thank you...

                        Are you okay?

           Walsh doesn’t answer right away.  Then...

                                 WALSH
                        The money. Top stock of the year.  
                        None of it meant a damn thing.  
                        “Prospector of The Year” - that was 
                        the big one.  The one my father always 
                        wanted. But I got it. I was the best.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RANCH - DAY

           Walsh and a REAL ESTATE AGENT(30’s), dressed like a drug store 
           cowboy, look over a sweet old RANCH HOUSE.

           They check out the KITCHEN -- beautiful, rustic, everything 
           Kay would love.  We follow Walsh as he opens the curtain in 
           the LIVING ROOM, opening to a massive bay window.

           Walsh looks out -- A BREATHTAKING VIEW of the mountains, a 
           sparkling lake rests in the middle of a waving meadow.
           Walsh smiles as he thinks about Kay.

                                 WALSH
                        Yeah... She’s gonna love it.

           Hotel STAFF set up the ballroom for a gala event.  There is a

           silver.  Floral centerpieces are being arranged.

           Outside the room a worker puts up the letters on a brass-stand

           EXT.  WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL - ROOF TOP - NIGHT

           A marvelous view, like the whole world sparkles for David 
           Walsh.  He stands, looking out, drinking it all in.  The door 
           opens behind him.  It’s Guzman, dressed to the nines.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Top of the world.

           Walsh turns to look at him as he approaches.

                                 WALSH
                        You know you clean up pretty good.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Wish I could say the same for you.

           They laugh, but Guzman’s manner is serious.  Walsh sees it.

                                 GUZMAN (CONT’D)
                        David.  I got a call from Busang.

           Walsh look back out over the city.

                                 WALSH
                        Okay.
                                 GUZMAN
                        There seems to be a problem at the 
                        site.  I’m flying out tonight.

           And now Walsh turns to Guzman.  There’s a look between them -- 
           we don’t know what it means, but it’s clearly significant.

                                 WALSH
                        Okay.

           A beat.  There’s a definite tension here.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Hell of ride, huh?

                                 WALSH
                        I got no regrets.

           That gets a smile from both men...but there’s a sadness here.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for saving my life.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Thanks for making your life worth 
                        saving.

           A very knowing look.  Their reactions are strange.  Not 
           alarmed by the news of “problems at the site,” but calm, 
           resigned.  

           They part with a handshake that has the feel of finality.

                                 WALSH
                        I’ll see ya, Mike.

                                 GUZMAN
                        Yeah.  I’ll see ya.

           Guzman turns, walking back across the roof.  Walsh watches him 
           go.  Unreadable.  And we...

           Walsh moves across the lobby to the front desk.  The DESK 
           ATTENDANT hands him an envelope.  Walsh slips him a tip.

           Walsh turns from the desk, opening the envelope.  He reads the 
           note.  Stops dead, the color draining from his face. 
                                 WALSH
                   (a whisper)

           He drops the message and strides for the front doors.

           EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - DINER - NIGHT

           Walsh runs down the sidewalk.  Across the street he sees 
           “Spiro’s 49th. Street Diner.”  

           Through the diner’s plate glass window, Walsh can see KAY 
           sitting alone at one of the tables.  The sight of her nearly 
           stops his heart.

           He takes a step forward but he suddenly stops.  He can’t face 
           her, not with what he has to do.  He swallows and fights back 
           the emotion and lets his mind prevail.

           Instead of walking into the diner, he moves across the street 
           to a PAY PHONE.  He can still see her as he feeds a coin into 
           the phone... 

           WE GO TIGHTER ON THE DINER’S WINDOW -- The SOUND of a phone 
           ringing on the line.

                        Spiro’s 49th. Street diner.

           Through the window, we see a Waitress approach Kay.  She says 
           something and gestures for Kay to follow.  She leads her to 
           the CASHIER where Kay is handed a phone receiver.

           Walsh watches Kay’s every move through the window, listens to 
           every word as if it will be the last time they ever speak.

                        mean to bother you, David.

           A long beat.

                                 WALSH
                        Is that it?

                        ...I miss you.

           This is killing Walsh.  He takes a long breath, then...

                                 WALSH
                        ...I miss you, too.  But it’s better

                        No. David, why? I don’t understand.

           Walsh fights back the emotion.

                                 WALSH
                        I’ve got to go.

                                 WALSH
                        Go home, Kay. Live your life. I’m 
                        sorry.

           ON WALSH, watching Kay through the glass as she begins to cry.  
           There are tears in his eyes.  He can barely get the words 
           out...

                                 DAVID
                        Goodbye, Kay. 

           He hangs up -- Kay falls into her hands and sobs.  Walsh 
           watches her as she heads for the door.  Someone bangs into her 
           and she almost falls.  She makes it out onto the crowded 
           street.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS

           As Kay waits for a taxi -- you can clearly see the last 
           fragments of David Walsh’s heart are now broken.  He looks at 
           her, knowing full well, he may never see her again.

           Walsh rises from his table and makes his way to the dais, 
           showered with applause and FLASHING cameras! 

           He waves to the crowd as they rise to their feet.  This is

           Guzman sits alone in the hold of the chopper.  A PILOT and 
           another SOLDIER sit up front, both armed.

           The chopper flies, skimming the canopy, finding the Busang 
           river far below.  The chopper arcs in, following the river’s 
           course, heading up river into the heart of the jungle.  

           Guzman stares out, taking in the breathtaking beauty, like a 
           man going home.  He cracks a beer and takes a long swig.

                        could think about, all I could see, 
                        was Indonesia.  It was like it was

           Guzman in the back of the chopper.  He drains his beer and 
           tosses the can.  A glance up at the soldiers up front.  An 
           involuntary breath...and a smile creeps onto his face.

           (STILL SUPER SLOW MO)

           Guzman undoes his seat belt and walks over to the open hatch 
           door of the chopper.  He looks down at the river as it passes 
           below... It’s like he’s looking into a dream...

           Then without a word...

           ON WALSH -- FLASH! FLASH!  And out of the burst of light --

           SILENCE.

           In total silence -- Michael Guzman jumps from the flying 
           helicopter, sailing without a parachute toward the water 
           below!

           ON WALSH -- FLASH!  He walks out the front door of the Waldorf-
           Astoria, through more of the adoring crowd.  

           ON THE PILOT -- as he turns and looks back and sees the EMPTY 
           SEAT in the hold.  Nothing but wind and empty beer cans.  

           He looks out the OPEN SIDE HATCH.  MIKE GUZMAN IS GONE!

           THE FACE OF DAVID WALSH -- as he steps off the sidewalk and 
           into the back of a stretch limo.  The door closes and he

           The tribesman hack through the perimeter and emerges onto the 
           wide silt bank of the river.  A PACK OF BOARS let out a chorus 
           of squeals. VULTURES wait their turn take.  And there, splayed 
           on the river bank we find --

           A BODY.

           The body is badly decomposed, it’s face and hands eaten away 
           by the scavengers.  The soldier checks the pockets and pulls 
           out a wallet.  He checks the ID -- 

           This time we see the picture on the ID, and the name --

           The phone starts to ring -- David doesn’t move.  The warm body 
           next to him,  slowly leans over and picks up.

                        David, it sounds like it’s important.

           Walsh sits up on the side of the bed, he looks like a wreak, 
           runs his hands through his hair as he takes the phone.

           a leftover drink, takes a swing as he listens.

           his car, the crowd converges on him.  He can barely get his 
           car door open.

           He squeezes out and pushes through the furious crowd --

                        Please, calm down - I don’t know 
                        anymore than you do right now!

           Walsh’s face!  It staggers him.  The crowd lets out a roar of 
           approval -- this is getting real ugly, real fast.

           but it’s Connie Wright.  Bobby Burns is with him.  They pull

           Walsh -- he looks like a ghost. 

                                 BOBBY BURNS
                        David...The New York Stock Exchange 
                        just suspended trading.  They’re 
                        taking  Bre-x off the board.  

           They both know what this means -- Bre-x is done, finished. 
           Walsh sinks back in his chair.  The news seems to take 
           whatever air he’s got left out of him.

           A long silent moment -- there’s nothing more to say, but Bobby 
           just stands there.  He looks in shock, like he’s had his soul 
           ripped out.  Walsh looks up at him...
                                 WALSH
                        You sold some, right?  Put something 
                        away?  

           Bobby hesitates before answering...

                                 BOBBY BURNS
                        Yeah... 

           ...and it’s clear he didn’t sell a damn thing.

                                 WALSH
                        Bobby?...

           Bobby can’t meet David’s eyes.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Fuck, Bobby!  I told you to sell some.

                                 BOBBY BURNS
                        I thought it was just going to keep 
                        getting better.

                                 WALSH
                        Christ...

           Walsh is genuinely distressed.  And then Bobby looks up -- his 
           eyes are damp, on the verge of crying.  He can barely speak...

                                 BOBBY BURNS
                        ...Did you know, David? 

           It’s like a blow to the heart...

                                 WALSH
                        Did I know what?  That Mike Guzman.  
                        My partner, was gonna jump out of a 
                        fucking helicopter and leave me in a 
                        pile?  Did I know?   I can’t believe 
                        you would ask me that!

           Bobby looks absolutely crushed.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take care of you, Bobby. 

           Bobby’s expression hardens -- fists clenched like he’s gonna 
           punch Walsh.

                                 BOBBY BURNS
                        I don’t want you to take care of me! I 
                        want you to leave me the fuck alone!
           Bobby walks away, a busted man.  Stanton looks across to Walsh 
           from his desk.

                                 STANTON
                        Friends close, enemies closer, right 
                        David?  

                                 WALSH
                        What the fuck is that supposed to 
                        mean?!

           But before this can escalate, Connie rushes in carrying a 
           sheath of PAPERS.

                                 CONNIE
                        David...

           Walsh turns to him.  One look at Connie’s face and he knows 
           this is big.

                                 WALSH
                        What?

                                 CONNIE
                        I don’t even know how to say this to 
                        you, man.

           He dumps the papers on Walsh’s desk.

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Just look.

           Walsh reads.  It doesn’t take him long to understand.

                                 WALSH
                        Mother...FUCKER!

           Connie answers Stanton’s questioning look.

                                 CONNIE
                        Guzman was dumping stock - the last 
                        seven months.  He’s got a shell 
                        company set up in the Philippines. 

                                 STANTON
                        How much?

                                 CONNIE
                        One fifty - one seventy five, best I 
                        can tell.  Didn’t file a goddamn thing 
                        - it’s all off the books.

                                 STANTON
                        Son of a bitch... What do we do?
           Walsh looks up -- isn’t that the question of the fucking hour?  
           And off the three of them, staggered, we...

                                             CUT TO:

           INT. FBI OFFICE / RENO - DAY

           Walsh in an FBI agent’s office, being swallowed up by an 
           overstuffed sofa -- he looks, suddenly, very small.  
           Vulnerable. 

            AGENT BOOTH(40s) stands opposite, leaning against his desk.  
           A younger AGENT sits in a side chair, taking notes.  

           Walsh is smoking, dragging on his smoke with an edge of 
           desperation.

                                 WALSH
                        ...Why does someone embezzle one 
                        hundred and seventy five million 
                        dollars and then take a header out of 
                        a chopper?  It doesn’t make any sense? 

                                 BOOTH
                        You’re saying Mike Guzman is alive?  
                        He staged his own death?

                                 WALSH
                        Mike was fifteen years in that jungle - 
                        he knows that river like the back of 
                        his hand, knows the local tribes, 
                        speaks the language.  If anyone could 
                        pull this off, Mike’s the guy.

                                 BOOTH
                        They found the body...

                                 WALSH
                        They found a body.  It’s Indonesia, 
                        bodies are cheaper than a pack of 
                        smokes.  I mean, come on, wild boars 
                        eating away the hands and face?  
                        That’s a little convenient, don’t you 
                        think?  

                                 BOOTH
                        There was an autopsy, Mr. Walsh.  He’s 
                        been positively ID’d.

                                 WALSH
                        By who?  The guy’s got a hundred 
                        seventy five mil in his pocket. You 
                        don’t think he can buy whatever 
                        autopsy result he wants?
           Booth is listening, but definitely not convinced.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Look, Mike Guzman took everything from 
                        me.  I can’t just let him get away 
                        with it.

           Booth considers.  Then...

                                 BOOTH
                        I’ll contact our embassy in Jakarta.  
                        We’ll take a look at the autopsy 
                        results.

                                 WALSH
                        That autopsy was bought and paid for!  
                        I’m telling you...
                   (pause)
                        I want you to do your own autopsy. 
                        You’re building a case, right?  
                        Against me.  So you have the legal 
                        right, jurisdiction or whatever...I 
                        just want the truth out there.  I want 
                        people to know I didn’t do this.  
                        That’s all I’m asking for.  The truth.

                                 BOOTH
                        I’m going to look into this.  That 
                        much I can promise you.

           And off Walsh, that much he will take, we...

           INT. NBC NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

           Sitting with ROGER MUDD is PETER MUNK, chairman of Barrick 
           Gold.  Munk looks clean as a the driven snow, dripping with 
           self-righteous confidence.  He’s busy re-writing history.  

                                 MUNK
                        We suspected there were problems early 
                        on, which is why we decided not to 
                        pursue the joint venture Bre-X offered 
                        us.  We got as many of our investors 
                        out of Bre-x as fast as possible.

           An insert PHOTO of David Walsh and Mike Guzman appears in the 
           corner of the screen.

                                 ROGER MUDD
                        A lot of people made money on this. It 
                        was good for a lot of investors.  You 
                        made a lot of money. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROGER MUDD (CONT'D)
                        I mean before the walls came tumbling 
                        down.  Is that correct?

           Munk doesn't want to talk about that.

                                 MUNK
                        ...But a lot of people didn’t get out, 
                        Roger. 

                                 ROGER MUDD
                        And how much money was lost in the Bre-
                        x fraud?  That we know of.  

                                 MUNK
                        It was a lot of money.

                                 ROGER MUDD
                        Do you have a number?

                                 MUNK
                        Billions.  Investors lost billions of 
                        dollars.

           They let that land.  

                                 ROGER MUDD
                        David Walsh has consistently 
                        maintained his innocence, claiming he 
                        didn’t know, that he was duped along 
                        with everyone else.  Given that, I was 
                        wondering what you make of this.

           He picks up a copy of NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE -- David Walsh on the 
           cover.  Mudd read the caption out loud:  

                                 MUDD
                        “David Walsh - Fool or Mastermind?” 
                        ...Care to comment?

           Off Munk, maybe for the first time, he’s at a loss...

                                 MUNK
                        It’s a damn good question.

                                             CUT TO:

           INT. CRAPPY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The place is a dump -- pizza boxes, fast food wrappers and 
           empty bottles of Seagrams litter every surface. 

           We find Walsh sitting up in bed, fully clothed, shoes off, 
           watching Munk on the TV.
           A KNOCK on the door startles him.  He’s clearly on edge.  

           He mutes the TV and goes to the door, peering out the closed 
           curtains before checking the peep hole.  He undoes the chain, 
           turns the dead bolt and opens the door.

           AGENT BOOTH is standing there.  He peers inside.

                                 BOOTH
                        Nice digs.

                                 WALSH
                        There was a thing at my house.  There 
                        have been some threats, I’m keeping a 
                        bit of a low profile these days.

                                 BOOTH
                        Can we talk?

                                 WALSH
                        Yeah.
                   (then...)
                        Do I need a lawyer?

                                 BOOTH
                        Not for this conversation, but I 
                        assume you’ve got one?

                                 WALSH
                        I’ve got lawyers crawling out of every 
                        orifice.  What do you know?

           EXT. MOTEL - EXTERIOR WALKWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Walsh and Booth stand smoking, bathed in the oscillating wash 
           of the motel’s neon sign.

                                 BOOTH
                        We’ve contacted Interpol.  We’re 
                        putting out an APB on Mike Guzman.

                                 WALSH
                        He’s alive...

                                 BOOTH
                        We don’t know anything for sure... But 
                        there are irregularities.

                                 WALSH
                        Okay...
                                 BOOTH
                        The Indonesian government has sealed 
                        the autopsy results.  They won’t let 
                        us have them.

                                 WALSH
                        What?!  That is complete bullshit!  
                        You see what I’m saying?!

                                 BOOTH
                        As for doing our own autopsy that’s 
                        not gonna happen...
                   (off Walsh’s look)
                        They cremated the body.  There’s 
                        nothing we can do.

           Walsh slumps back against the wall.

                                 WALSH
                        So, that’s it. Where does that leave 
                        me?

                                 BOOTH
                        You’ve got a story to tell?  I suggest 
                        you start telling it.

                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. BRE-X HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Walsh stands on the steps in front of the building, a hundred 
           MICROPHONES and CAMERAS in his face.  NEWS VANS jam the 
           sidewalk.  A mob of PROTESTORS are held at bay by POLICE.

                                 WALSH
                   (like he’s reading a 
                    script)
                        Mike Guzman was my friend and partner 
                        and he betrayed me. I had no knowledge 
                        of the deception he perpetrated but, 
                        as CEO of this company, it was my job 
                        to know.  I take full responsibility 
                        for my failure in this regard and I 
                        apologize sincerely to those who have 
                        lost their investment. I want it to be 
                        known that I did not, nor will I, 
                        profit from this situation beyond the 
                        salary I received as CEO.  Every share 
                        of stock I owned was kept in the 
                        company - I never sold a single share 
                        of Bre-x stock.  No one lost more 
                        money on this than me.
                   (beat)
                        That’s all I have to say at this time.
           The assembled reporters shout out a flurry of questions, but 
           Walsh just turns and heads...

           INT. BRE-X HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh enters, shoulders slumped, tears in his eyes.  A 
           defeated man.  He is greeted by nods of approval, some 
           handshakes, from the assembled employees.  Bobby Burns is 
           conspicuously absent.

           And then Walsh sees AGENT BOOTH, who steps to him with an air 
           of regret.

                                 BOOTH
                        I’m sorry Mr. Walsh, but I have to 
                        inform you... Don’t leave the State - 
                        don’t even leave the city.  You 
                        understand what I’m telling you?  

           Off Walsh, the writing on the fucking wall, we go...

           INT. THREE GREENHORNS - EVENING

           Walsh moves to the end of the bar where Roy is setting up for 
           the night rush -- he grabs a bottle of Seagrams at Walsh’s 
           approach and pours.

           Walsh waves him off.

                                 WALSH
                        I’m good, Roy.  Thanks, though.

           He slides a MANILA envelope across the bar to Roy.

                                 WALSH (CONT’D)
                        Can you do me a favor?  Get this to 
                        Kay for me?

                                 ROY
                        I’ll try.

           David turns -- he takes in the Three Greenhorns for what seems 
           like the last time...because it is.  He turns back -- second 
           thoughts -- takes the poured drink and downs it.

                                 WALSH
                   (as explanation)
                        For the road.  Be good, Roy.

           And, with that, he walks out the door.  The SOUND OF JET 
           NOISE, takes us...
           EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT

           A TAXI pulls up beside a waiting private jet.  Walsh gets out 
           of the cab.  Pulling a single small carry-on behind him, he 
           boards the plane.

           MUSIC COMES UP -- WE TIME DISSOLVE TO...

           THE PLANE RACING DOWN THE RUNWAY.  As it takes flight, 
           climbing, climbing...we...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RANCH ROAD - DAY

           A beat up ford Escort snakes it’s way up a dirt mountain road.  

           The Escort Pulls up to the RANCH HOUSE.  Kay and the REAL 
           ESTATE AGENT get out.  In Kay’s hands she holds the MANILA 
           ENVELOPE -- A PROPERTY DEED.  She looks around...

                                 KAY
                        Is it really mine?

                                 AGENT
                        It’s all paid for. In your name.  

           INT. RANCE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Kay walks into the living room.  It’s beautiful.  Kay looks 
           over and stops in her tracks, her breath taken from her -- 

           ON THE COFFEE TABLE is vase of YELLOW ROSES.  An ENVELOPE 
           rests against the vase -- “KAY” hand-written across it.

           Kay picks up the envelope and opens it.  She reads the LETTER 
           inside, her face hard to read, is she going to laugh or cry?   

           With tears in her eyes, she goes to the big bay window and 
           opens the curtains...

           MATCH CUT:

           -- PLANTATION SHUTTERS opening to reveal...

           A PERFECT, TROPICAL BEACH.  We are...

           INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM -- MORNING

           Walsh has just opened the THE PLANTATION SHUTTERS --

           We now see that the interview has been taking place inside a 
           beautiful beach villa.  
           SUPER OVER -- 

                     NASSAU, BAHAMAS -- JUNE, 1997

           Walsh stares out over paradise, fresh drink in hand.

                                 WALSH
                        You want the truth? The truth becomes 
                        insignificant when everyone’s getting 
                        rich.  All anyone had to do was look. 
                        Just open their eyes.  But no one 
                        looked, because no one wanted to know.  
                        Including me.  
                   (beat)
                        You got the Rolling Stones playing in 
                        your living room, you want to be the 
                        one pulling the plug?
                   (then...)
                        It’s greed. Greed is the only truth 
                        there is, and greed is blind. 

                                 JENNINGS
                        Still doesn’t answer the question.

                                 WALSH
                        Then change the question.  Because, I 
                        just gave you the answer.

           A long beat.  Jennings and Walsh -- eyes locked.  There’s 
           nothing more to say...

           Jennings turns back to his micro-recorder.

                                 JENNINGS
                        End of deposition, 6:45 AM, Seventeen, 
                        June, Nineteen ninety seven, conducted 
                        by Paul K. Jennings - Hudgins, Kaller 
                        and Mallone, LLC.

           He hits ‘stop’ and begins packing up his things.

                                 WALSH
                        I hope you got what you needed.

           Jennings looks up at him -- Walsh knows damn well Jennings got 
           nothing at all.

                                 JENNINGS
                        Is he alive?  Guzman?  You really 
                        think he’s alive?
                                 WALSH
                        If I were a betting man - and I think 
                        you know I am - I’d put my money on 
                        Mike Guzman every time.

           Jennings’ look says it all -- “now you’re just fucking with 
           me...”  Jennings snaps his briefcase shut and rises. 

                                 JENNINGS
                        Thanks for your time.  We’ll be in 
                        touch if we need anything more.

                                 WALSH
                        You know where to find me.

           There’s a hint of sadness in this -- Walsh isn’t going 
           anywhere and he knows it.  Jennings moves to the door.  He  
           opens it but stops and turns back to Walsh.

                                 JENNINGS
                        Just one more question...off the 
                        record - my own curiosity... If you 
                        didn’t sell any stock, how did you buy 
                        this place?

           Walsh responds deadpan.

                                 WALSH
                        Who says I bought it? 

           A beat between them -- something communicated -- what, 
           exactly, Jennings can’t be sure.

                                 JENNINGS
                        Well, it’s a beautiful island.  
                        Interesting thing about the Bahamas - 
                        no extradition treaty with the U.S. 
                        for white collar crimes.  But you 
                        probably know all about that.

                                 WALSH
                        Have a safe trip home.

           Jennings takes one last look at Walsh, surrounded by luxury 
           but looking very much alone.  He leaves with a slight nod and, 
           as he pulls the door closed behind him, we...

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. BAHAMAS - BEACH - AFTERNOON

           Walsh stands on the beach just beyond the breaks -- staring 
           out at the endless sea.  
           Just the sound of the water, and the sorrow of isolation.  He 
           pulls something from his shirt pocket and looks at it -- 

           THE NAPKIN -- the one he and Guzman signed in the jungle -- 
           the agreement.  He stares down at it a long beat.  And we get 
           a look at it as well.  It reads, quite simply:

                             “50-50”
                        What ever it takes...

           Two faded signatures at the bottom seal the deal -- David 
           Walsh and Mike Guzman.

           Walsh thinks for a moment -- an ironic look in his eyes.  He 
           crumples up the napkin and tosses it into the surf.  

           And as it bobs away, consumed by the sea, Walsh turns.  A drag 
           on his smoke, a sip of Whiskey and he looks down the beach --  

           What he sees, wrapped in the early morning mist -- THE FIGURE 
           OF A WOMAN walking toward him.  Is it Kay or someone else?  Is 
           she real or just a dream in Walsh’s mind, in his broken heart?  

           He smiles as he stares at the woman.  And if you look close 
           enough, it’s there, in his eyes... The truth...

                                            FADE OUT:

           MUSIC UP AND ROCKIN’ -- Something like “Street Fighting Man.”

           SUPER OVER -- 

           David Walsh never returned to the United States.  He lived out 
           his days in quiet luxury in the Bahamas with assets estimated 
           in excess of 80 million dollars.  

           No one has ever been able to prove where his money came from.  
           No charges have ever been brought against him stemming from 
           the Bre-X fraud.

           The mystery of Michael Guzman’s death or disappearance has 
           never been resolved.  To this day, the results of his autopsy 
           remain sealed.  If he is alive, he got away with a fortune.

           The Bre-X scandal still stands as the largest investment fraud 
           in history...

                             THE END
