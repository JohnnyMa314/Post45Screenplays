                        Bullet Points on a Fluffer’s Résumé.

           MUSIC: Thin Lizzy’s “Whiskey in the Jar”

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Seated at a white desk by the window, her dark hair tied up 
           in a loose, slept-on knot, is WREN (Karen DeSantis, 17). Her 
           soft, pale skin reveals a network of thin blue veins. A pair 
           of old, too-big velour pajamas hangs off her slender, boyish 
           frame. A pretty girl, if you ever catch her smiling.

           Wren writes a list in her diary, pensive.

                                 WREN (V.O.)
                        Team player.

           We explore the room, a schizophrenic collision of girly youth 
           and teen snark. On the bureau, one My Little Pony mounts 
           another.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Stick-to-itiveness.

           Over the bed is a poster of a bronze statue in Dublin’s 
           Grafton Street. Phil Lynott, Thin Lizzy, 1949-1986.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Conceive and implement strategies 
                        for sustaining growth during 
                        periods of inactivity.

           Wren chews her pencil and studies the page — a painter in 
           search of her master stroke.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Hands-on. Or off.

           She dabs a rubber stamp with ink and stamps the list. It 
           features a grinning 1950’s man, thumbs up, and the word “Ace!”

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Wren walks down the hallway with a towel over her shoulder. 
           She passes a door painted entirely black. It THROBS with the 
           pounding of some early morning drum practice.

                                 WREN (V.O.)
                        Possible Explanations for the 
                        Vicious Curse That Is My Brother.
           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Wren undresses, avoiding her own reflection in the mirror.

                                 WREN (V.O.)
                        Mom paid secret conjugal visit to 
                        Charles Manson.

           She steps into the shower and we follow. Billows of steam 
           envelop her.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        God’s revenge for when I soiled the 
                        baptism well. That’s what you get 
                        for waterboarding a newborn.

           We jump through Wren’s routine. She shaves her pits, loofahs 
           her face. Her agitation is apparent in her fervent shampooing. 
           Now she rinses her hair, letting the warm water wash over her.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The doctors missed Dad’s colon and 
                        radiated his balls.

           She shuts off the water, but doesn’t move. Dad. Wren lets out 
           a long, melancholy breath.

           Suddenly, she stops, sniffs. Is someone there? She yanks back 
           the shower curtain.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        Albert!

           Seated on the toilet, butt naked, with the funnies folded in 
           four like the sports page, is ALBERT (8), Wren’s brother. Fat 
           cheeks, cowlick hair, feet dangling a foot off the ground, and 
           totally impassive.

           Albert holds up a finger: “Be with you in a sec.”

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Wren’s mom, JOY (42), eats a yogurt at the counter. She’s tall, 
           slim and dressed in the latest workout gear. Her highlighted 
           hair is pulled back in a bouncy ponytail. Not bad for her age.

           Wren storms in towelling off her hair.

                                 WREN
                        Mom! He struck again. God damn 
                        Adolph Shitler.
                                 JOY
                        Oh, Hon. He just wants to be close 
                        to you.

           Wren digs through a stack of paper by the phone, exasperated.

                                 WREN
                        Have you signed my application yet?

                                 JOY
                        What are you applying for?

                                 WREN
                        Iraqi citizenship. Hello! College 
                        loans?

                                 JOY
                        Oh. I don’t know, have I?

           Nothing by the phone. On the table Wren finds a heap of 
           Albert’s CRAYON DRAWINGS: race cars with gun turrets, 
           assorted scenes of carnage, an airplane that’s taking a poop. 
           Wren flips over a drawing. Of course — it’s her application.

                                 WREN
                        Awesome.

           Joy takes the drawing, appraising it like an art buff.

                                 JOY
                        What is that, some kind of fire-
                        breathing tit monster? So creative.

           Right then Albert cruises in wearing tighty whities, galoshes, 
           swim goggles and a cape. He’s no taller than four feet, with a 
           belly like a four square ball. He fills a commuter mug with 
           COFFEE and dumps in half a jar of sugar.

           Wren looks at her mom like, aren’t you going to say anything? 
           Joy puts on her mom face.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Boo-Bear? Lid.

           Albert snaps a lid on his coffee and climbs onto a chair in 
           the breakfast nook. Wren drops her towel and gathers what 
           remains of the application.

                                 WREN
                        I’ll get another copy from the 
                        counselor. Can you just sign the 
                        last page?
                                 JOY
                        Whoa whoa. You cannot go to school 
                        wearing that.

           Wren wears a T-shirt that reads, simply, “SUCK MY DICK.”

                                 WREN
                        I definitely can’t go not wearing it.

           Joy folds her arms. Wren sighs and pulls on the threadbare 
           ARMY JACKET tied around her waist. The grungy old relic could 
           easily have been swiped from a bum that morning.

                                 JOY
                             (Not much better.)
                        Much better.

           Wren puts on her backpack, anxious to go. Joy flips casually 
           through the application.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        You’ve taken six semesters of 
                        pottery?

                                 WREN
                        Mom!

                                 JOY
                        Oh by the way, Keevin and I have 
                        been invited to a rager --

                                 WREN
                        A “rager”?

                                 JOY
                        -- so I need you to take Albert 
                        trick-or-treating.

                                 WREN
                        Sorry, I’ve got plans.

                                 JOY
                        Sorry, postpone.

                                 WREN
                        Postpone? You can’t just go out any 
                        random night wearing a costume and 
                        pretend it’s Halloween. People will 
                        think you’re medicating.

                                 JOY
                        Costume! Crap, I knew I forgot 
                        something. 
           She fishes a TWENTY from her purse, nodding to Albert.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Do you mind? Just no guns, swords or 
                        nunchuks, or anything that could be 
                        fashioned into a gun, sword or nunchuk.

                                 WREN
                        Eff this! Why do you get to go out 
                        and I don’t?

                                 JOY
                        Because you’re 17. And I’m... over 
                        30. And I’m you’re mother. And I’m 
                        not having this discussion. You’re 
                        watching your brother, I’m raging. 
                        The end.

           Wren gapes silently while Joy turns back to the application. 
           Over at the table, Albert is two knuckles deep in his nose.

                                 WREN
                        No.

                                 JOY
                        Excuse me?

                                 WREN
                        No way. I’m not missing my last 
                        Halloween in Westbrae for him. Get 
                        him a sitter. Or a Lo-Jack.

           Joy exhales through clenched teeth and faces her daughter.

                                 JOY
                        You know, Karen, I don’t ask a whole 
                        lot of you. You have no chores, you 
                        ignore your curfew. Now you want me to 
                        take out loans for 45,000 dollars a 
                        year so you can go sleep until noon in 
                        another time zone? Uh-uh. You start 
                        showing a little responsibility, a 
                        little consideration for someone other 
                        than yourself, or I’m not signing 
                        anything.

                                 WREN
                        But the application is due tomorrow!

           Joy slaps the application closed and holds out the twenty.

                                 JOY
                        Then I’ll sign tomorrow.
           Wren grudgingly accepts the twenty. Joy starts tossing random 
           items into Albert’s lunch box: a whole block of cheese, a 
           cucumber. Wren makes one last-ditch effort, softening her tone.

                                 WREN
                        Also, tonight’s my night to, you 
                        know... Go see Dad.

           She lowers her eyes. Joy gives her a sympathetic look.

                                 JOY
                        Oh, Hon...
                             (then)
                        He’s not going anywhere.

           Right then, a MAN calls from another room.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Joy? Have you seen my Dockers?

                                 JOY
                        In here.

           KEEVIN enters in an undershirt and boxer briefs. He’s broad-
           shouldered, sun-kissed, smokin’ hot. And about 27 years old.

                                 KEEVIN
                        Good morning, m’lady.

           He bows to Wren with a flourish, then bumps fists with Albert.

                                 KEEVIN (CONT’D)
                        M’dog.

           Joy beams, nodding to a pair of khakis hanging from a chair.

                                 JOY
                        Freshly ironed.

           Keevin pulls them on, his eyes rolling back in a way that can 
           only be described as orgasmic. He actually PURRS.

                                 KEEVIN
                        Still warm.

           He glides over to Joy, whose hands instinctively explore his 
           muscular chest. They mutter through hot breaths.

                                 KEEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t think I’d see you up.

                                 JOY
                        Don’t flatter yourself.
                                 KEEVIN
                        Oh, that sounds like a challenge.

           They giggle and press together, until, as if no one else is 
           there, they start MACKING. Hard. They fall back against the 
           counter and a dish CLATTERS to the ground. They’re undeterred.

           Oblivious, Albert empties an entire box of Cocoa Puffs onto 
           the table in search of the prize. Bits spill on the floor.

           Alone in her outrage, Wren storms out.

           EXT. BUS STOP - LATER

           Wren waits for the bus with APRIL (17), future Girl Gone Wild 
           and current star of half the student body’s masturbation 
           fantasies. Her well-glossed lips have a way of suggesting 
           recent or imminent fellatio at all times. If she were 30 years 
           older, she’d have a beehive and smoke Pall Malls.

                                 APRIL
                        I don’t know what you’re complaining 
                        about. If Keevin Kilpatrick was 
                        sleeping at my house, I’d never stop 
                        sniffing his underwear.

                                 WREN
                        That’s disgusting.

                                 APRIL
                        Oh, but not when guys do it?

                                 WREN
                        So you inhaling a man’s butt sweat is 
                        a crack in the glass ceiling?

                                 APRIL
                        That’s right. I’m the Rosa Parks of kink.

                                 WREN
                        You mean Susan B. Anthony, or 
                        Hillary Clinton.

                                 APRIL
                        What? No, I insist on my right to 
                        sniff men’s underwear.

                                 WREN
                        At the front of the bus?
                                 APRIL
                        Whatever. So what time do you want to 
                        go to Aaron Riley’s? I heard his 
                        stepmom got him two kegs of Natty.

                                 WREN
                        Yeah, bad news. My mom stuck me 
                        with troll patrol.

                                 APRIL
                        What?! It’s the biggest party of 
                        the semester! Only dorks and drama 
                        kids don’t go.

                                 WREN
                        She’s holding next year over my 
                        head, says I need to show some 
                        responsibility. Which is rich, 
                        right? If she was so responsible, 
                        there never would’ve even been an 
                        Albert. Just a psychotic sperm.

                                 APRIL
                        That’s blackmail, Wren. Or 
                        extortion... Wait, racketeering?

                                 WREN
                        Whatever, I can suck up one night of 
                        suffering for four years of freedom.

                                 APRIL
                        So what am I supposed to do?

                                 WREN
                        You could hang out with me, pick 
                        through Keevin’s laundry.

           The school bus arrives and they climb on.

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

                                 APRIL
                        See, you don’t even appreciate it. 
                        It’s like the Spank Bank opened a 
                        branch in your house. Hey, Mr. Combs.

           MR. COMBS (50’s) is an affable, Hagrid-sized bus driver with 
           a thick “Norf” London accent. He dangles a cigarette out the 
           little side window.

                                 MR. COMBS
                        Morning, ladies. Big plans tonight?
                                 APRIL
                        Well I’m getting wasted.

                                 MR. COMBS
                        Good on ya. Young people got to get 
                        a feel for the drink, find out 
                        before they got roommates if 
                        they’re the kind to black out and 
                        take a dump in the hamper.

                                 WREN
                        Don’t worry, Mr. Combs. April’s 
                        more of a cryer.

                                 MR. COMBS
                        Guess it’s all the same, eh? You 
                        drink enough, something bad is 
                        bound to come out. Just remember, 
                        girls, if you can’t learn to love 
                        yourself, who the fuck will?

           The girls ponder this as they move down the aisle. A smattering 
           of kids are in COSTUME, mainly nerdy types. There’s a Darth 
           Maul, two Lady Gagas, the robot from Futurama, whose stiff 
           cardboard torso is suspended between two seats. They must not 
           have gotten the memo; all the cool kids are in street clothes.

           Not for the first time, April winces at Wren’s jacket.

                                 APRIL
                        Christ, Wren, it’s starting to 
                        smell like buttermilk.

                                 WREN
                        No, April.

                                 APRIL
                        Just once. One wash? You’re not 
                        gonna wash away the memories, just 
                        30 years of armpit.

           They pass two skinny guys in full costume, who’ve been 
           watching furtively since the girls got on.

                                 WREN
                        Hey Roosevelt, hey Peng.

           PENG (16) is the son of recent immigrants from Korea, and 
           their principal means of assimilation. He’s dressed as some 
           kind of PATRIOT, in white Little League pants, a women’s pea 
           coat and a wig dusted with flour. Paired with these are his 
           usual thick glasses that darken automatically in sunlight. 
           Peng talks twice his size, which is puny.
           ROOSEVELT (16) is dressed like he’s on SAFARI, in khaki and a 
           pith helmet. Beside him is a large butterfly net. His boyish 
           face sits atop a lanky frame that hasn’t caught up with 
           itself. He’s soft-spoken, with a simple, almost naive 
           sincerity borne of a very, very loving home.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                             (unconvincing nonchalance)
                        Oh hey Wren! Good morning to you.

           Wren gives a half smile as they continue on to the back. We 
           stick with the guys. Peng punches Roosevelt in the thigh.

                                 PENG
                             (sotto)
                        Dude! You know Mike Dooley?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Goatee in third grade Mike Dooley? 
                        Or vomited on your head at Six 
                        Flags Mike Dooley?

                                 PENG
                        Goatee in third grade. He told me --

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Um, fact check. Goatee Mike has a 
                        well-publicized policy of not 
                        talking to underclassmen.

                                 PENG
                        Alright! So I heard him telling Adam 
                        Oliphant how this summer when he was 
                        knocking boots with Wren DeSantis --

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        This story is suspect. Knocking boots?

                                 PENG
                        -- and she drops her drawers and 
                        it’s like, goosh...

           He mimes an explosion.

                                 PENG (CONT’D)
                        Gigantobush.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        What?
                                 PENG
                        Fuckin’ chia pubes, dog. Like she’s 
                        getting a shoulder ride from Marge 
                        Simpson.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I’m sure it isn’t blue.

                                 PENG
                        We’re talking full-on ZZ Bottom.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        ZZ...? I don’t even understand --

                                 PENG
                        Like ZZ Top, but on the bottom.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        OK, I very much doubt!...
                             (controlling himself)
                        I very much doubt she has a four-
                        foot beard between her legs, and 
                        even if she does, that’s her right, 
                        as an American, and hey maybe it’s 
                        not the most appropriate topic of 
                        discussion for a public bus.
                             (beat, can’t let it go)
                        By which I mean the lack of privacy, 
                        not the fact it’s funded by 
                        taxpayers, although I’d be curious 
                        to know what kind of municipal codes 
                        are on the books about that.

           He stares ahead, avoiding his friend’s eyes. Peng studies him. 
           After a long beat, Peng leans in, sotto:

                                 PENG
                        Yo, are you sprung?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Goodbye!

           He bolts up and staggers to the front of the still-moving bus.

           INT. CLASSROOM - LATE MORNING

           Wren slouches at her desk, sullen, while her CLASSMATES goof 
           off. She SCRIBBLES in her notebook.

                                 WREN (V.O.)
                        Unintended Consequences of Flunking 
                        American Lit.
           In the background, the TEACHER hands back papers. We can only 
           see his mid-section — Wren’s desk-eye view.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        At a loss when Twitter chat turns 
                        to Melville.

           A GIRL two rows over picks gum out of her hair.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Ineligible for student body president. 
                        So much for new mascot, Black Jesus.

           She connects eyes with April, who, lined up with the teacher 
           behind her, mimes giving him a BJ. Wren shakes her head.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Thanks to Mom the middle-aged 
                        skank, parent-teacher conference 
                        leads to parent-teacher dinner, 
                        parent-teacher nightcap, and the 
                        inevitable, intolerable...

           THWACK. Wren’s paper lands on her desk. Next to the large red 
           “D” is a STAMP in a familiar style. It features a sad cartoon 
           hobo, palms upturned, and the word “Oops!”

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...parent-teacher breakfast.

           PAN UP to reveal Wren’s teacher: Keevin. He’s dressed up as a 
           plumber. A very hot plumber. Keevin gives Wren a disappointed 
           look she pointedly ignores. In the background, Roosevelt and 
           Peng high-five over their papers.

                                 ROOSEVELT/PENG
                        Ace!

           INT. POTTERY CLASS - AFTERNOON

           Wren talks with her flavor-savered pottery teacher, MR. JAKE 
           (32). He wears Carhartts and Birks, plays Sublime in class, 
           and by the tempo of his speech, no doubt smoked his lunch. His 
           “costume” is a pair of those Venetian-blind sunglasses from 
           the 80s. It’s the first time we’ve seen Wren without a scowl.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        NYU, sure, I can see you there. I 
                        used to date a girl who went to NYU. 
                        She even wore black to the beach.
                                 WREN
                        Plus I’m a legacy. Private schools love 
                        that crap. They gotta help me out.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        I think if you’re applying for loans, 
                        they can assume you’re not that kind 
                        of legacy. I don’t suppose your dad 
                        ever endowed a music building?

                                 WREN
                        No, but the day after Lennon was 
                        shot, he and his band broke onto the 
                        roof and played Beatles covers until 
                        the cops showed up. They thought 
                        they were effed, but the cops just 
                        came up to request “Let It Be.”

           Mr. Jake SNAPS his fingers in groovy approval.

           Students turn in projects for firing on their way out. A 
           nebbishy TWERP furtively hands in a small clay TURTLE that is 
           actually a badly disguised PIPE.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Hold up, Kornblatt.

           The twerp stops, busted. He’s dressed as what looks like a 
           Jewish Ice Cube, with a thick dookie rope and a pick stuck in 
           his light brown fro. Mr. Jake drapes an arm over his neck.

                                 MR. JAKE (CONT’D)
                        First off, turtles don’t have 
                        eyebrows. Second, think about your 
                        bowl placement, man. No one wants 
                        to toke off a turtle’s ass.

           He holds the pipe aloft for the class.

                                 MR. JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and bros, let me remind you 
                        this is a pottery class, not a bong 
                        factory. So please... not so obvious?

           Around the room, everyone quickly re-works their pieces.

                                 WREN
                        My mom says I’m just running away, that 
                        you can’t escape something that’s inside 
                        of you. But I’m like, I can escape you 
                        always saying that kind of crap.
                                 MR. JAKE
                        There’s always Foothill.

                                 WREN
                        Junior college? I’d rather eat a 
                        turd. Honestly, serve it up piping 
                        hot, because you won’t catch me 
                        within a mile of that tard farm. 

                                 MR. JAKE
                        We could carpool.

                                 WREN
                        I mean, it’s an option.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Charlene’s dogging me to take the 
                        LSAT, make something of myself. But 
                        like, there’s more to life than just 
                        what you accomplish. You know?

           Wren nods, savoring this kernel of profundity. Right then, 
           they’re joined by AARON RILEY (18). He’s waifish, pouty, 
           dressed all in tight black, and wears a BACKPACK SHAPED LIKE 
           KERMIT RIDING PIGGYBACK. Behind him hovers his EMO ENTOURAGE.

                                 AARON
                        Moving speech, Mr. Jake. Hey Wren.

                                 WREN
                        Hey, Aaron.

           She lowers her eyes, suddenly shy.

                                 AARON
                        I heart your jacket. Did anyone die 
                        wearing it?

                                 WREN
                        I don’t think so.

                                 AARON
                        Too bad. Did you know that the human 
                        brain remains conscious for up to a 
                        week after you die?

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Where did you hear that?

                                 AARON
                        Mr. Fineman’s class.
                                 WREN
                        Doesn’t Fineman teach gym?

           Aaron SLAPS OUT A RIFF on an imaginary bass guitar, SINGING 
           along with his eyes fluttering shut, as if possessed. It’s 
           strange.

                                 AARON
                             (singing)
                        Daka-dop-dow ba-dow.

                                 WREN
                        Are you OK?

                                 AARON
                        I’m writing a power ballad about 
                        you. It’s called Mystery Meat.

                                 WREN
                        Thank... you?

                                 AARON
                        I only have the intro, but it’s 
                        fucking sweet. Maybe I’ll play it 
                        for you tonight. You’re coming to 
                        my party, right?

                                 WREN
                        Well, I have to babysit --

                                 AARON
                             (slapping his “bass” and singing)
                        Shaka-kow, I say, gypsy lady in a 
                        dead man’s coat, sha-bow.

                                 WREN
                        I’ll try to make it.

                                 AARON
                        And I won’t play another note until 
                        you do.

           He holds his imaginary guitar out in front of him, then 
           “DROPS” it and walks off like a rockstar off stage. Mr. Jake 
           grins at Wren. She blushes and PUNCHES him hard in the arm.

           EXT. TENNIS COURT - AFTERNOON

           Albert stands motionless at the baseline. He wears a thick 
           headband and uses both hands to hold up an enormous racquet.

           Every few seconds, a ball is lobbed at him from a machine on 
           the other side. He barely moves, except to dodge them.
           With each passing ball, the aviator-wearing COACH working the 
           machine calls out half-heartedly. It’s all very subdued.

                                 COACH
                        Swing.

           Another ball passes.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Swing.

           And another.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Swing.

           Albert moves just enough to deflect a ball away from his leg.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, buddy. Swing the racquet.

           Another ball passes.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Albert?

           And another.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Swing the fucking racquet.

           CUT TO LATER:

           His gear all packed up, the coach joins Albert on his side. 
           Albert hasn’t moved. The coach looks past him, stretches.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Tell you what, champ. I got a lady-
                        friend coming in on the four o’clock 
                        bus, so I’m gonna let you work on that 
                        serve. Your mom give you the cash?

           Albert checks his watch. Still 20 minutes to go. The coach 
           gets his meaning. He rolls his eyes, sighing.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Alright, what do you want?

           EXT. ASIAN CONVENIENCE STORE NEAR COURT - MOMENTS LATER

           The coach emerges from the store with a black plastic bag, 
           checks to see no one’s watching, and hands it to Albert.
           Grinning, Albert pulls out a stack of MAGAZINES featuring 
           overweight women and titles like “Big’un,” “Assman,” “Yolanda.”

                                 COACH
                        Little young to start hoggin’.

           Albert reaches into the bottom of the bag and comes up with 
           fistful of FIREWORKS. The coach eyes him, wary.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        You planning some kind of bank heist?

           Albert finishes counting his loot and holds out his hand. The 
           coach rolls his eyes and pulls out Albert’s change.

           INT. HALLOWEEN SUPERSTORE - LATER

           It’s one of those gaudy shops that pops up in a vacant strip 
           mall every year, then vanishes like a fart in the wind.

           Wren and Albert wander through the racks of costumes. She 
           talks under her breath, as MOTHERS shoot her dirty looks.

                                 WREN
                        Aquaman is not a... fag. His battles 
                        just always end up looking like a 
                        synchronized swimming routine.

           They pass under a shoddy rubber skeleton on a meat hook.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        Where do these places come from 
                        every year? Is there a Public 
                        Storage locker somewhere full of 
                        headless butlers?

           She offers up a Yosemite Sam mask, which Albert refuses.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        You should be thankful Mom’s even 
                        buying you a costume. When I was 
                        your age, I cut eyeholes in a trash 
                        bag and went as a trash bag.
                             (then)
                        Here we go.

           She grabs a Spider-Man costume — just as Albert grabs a package 
           of his own. It features a ragged prosthetic stump and a pump 
           with fake blood. The label says, simply, “TORN-OFF ARM.”

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        That’s not a costume, Albert, that’s 
                        a visit from Social Services.
           Albert clutches the package, insistent.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, you love Spider-Man. He 
                        looks like a Mexican wrestler.

           Off Albert considering this new information, intrigued...

           DING-DONG.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH OF SUBURBAN HOUSE - DUSK

           It’s a compromise: Albert is SPIDER-MAN WITH A TORN-OFF ARM. 
           He waits beside Wren at a front door decorated with a sad old 
           rubber spider. In Albert’s free hand is a plastic trick-or-
           treat container shaped like a pumpkin.

           April opens the door in whiskers, ears and a tight leotard.

                                 WREN
                        Sexy kitty again?

                                 APRIL
                        Last year I was a sexy mouse. What 
                        are you, a homeless prom queen?

           Wren is dressed in a dowdy old gown and tiara, with a bouquet 
           of flowers. Over the dress, of course, is her army jacket.

                                 WREN
                        I’m Carrie.
                             (crickets)
                        Sissy Spacek? Stephen King? A 
                        tormented girl uses her telekinetic 
                        power to kill everyone she hates?
                             (crickets)
                        Yes, I’m a homeless prom queen.

           Albert steps up and proudly spurts blood from his stump.

                                 APRIL
                        OK that is disturbing. Have you given 
                        more thought to my roofie idea?

                                 WREN
                        Don’t worry, we’ll just take him 
                        for a quick lap down Mariposa, then 
                        put him to bed and head back out. 
                        Long as I’m back before my mom, she 
                        never has to know.
           EXT. NICE HOUSE - EVENING

           Joy and Keevin walk up the path of a fancy Spanish colonial. 
           He’s in his hot plumber outfit and she’s a CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL.

           They ring the bell. Joy looks around, impressed.

                                 JOY
                        Brueder owns this place?

                                 KEEVIN
                        Yeah right! This is his folks’ house.

           The door opens and they’re greeted by a COUPLE not much older 
           than Joy. Mid-50s tops. They seem slightly put out.

                                 MR. BRUEDER
                        Hi Keevin. The kids are in the basement.

           Music and whooping emanate from the distance. He stands aside 
           to let them pass.

                                 JOY
                        Hi, I’m Joy.

           She smiles and offers her hand. He shakes it limply.

                                 MR. BRUEDER
                        Mr. Brueder.

           EXT. MARIPOSA STREET - EVENING

           Something here is different. The mood is warmer, more cheerful, 
           instantly nostalgic. It’s the Halloween you remember, but never 
           really knew — a collage of a million collective memories, 
           moments, sounds, all thrown together and bathed in the 
           flickering orange light of 10,000 jack-o-lanterns.

           Mariposa is that street in every town that, as long as anyone 
           can remember, has been the place to be on Halloween. It’s 
           PACKED: toddlers and teenagers, cool kids and nerds, neighbors 
           who rarely speak drinking wine together in lawn chairs, 
           watching the parade of tiny vampires, ballerinas and 
           SpongeBobs shuffle past. For three solid blocks, reality is 
           suspended in a kind of living dream.

           Wren and April slouch down the middle of the street while 
           Albert runs side missions for candy.
                                 APRIL
                        This is huge, Wren. If you hump 
                        Aaron Riley, we’ll be set for 
                        senior year. It’s like being 
                        knighted. By his wang.

           Nearby, an offended mother cups her child’s ears.

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        Remember Cindy Damsky? She became 
                        like the number one or two girl on 
                        the bleachers at lunch. She had to 
                        have signing pages added to the back 
                        of her yearbook. And all she did was 
                        give Aaron an OTPHJ.
                             (off Wren’s confused look)
                        Over-The-Pants Hand Job?

                                 WREN
                        You make it sound so romantic.

                                 APRIL
                        Please, this is politics. Sex with 
                        Aaron is our school’s military service.

                                 WREN
                        What’s up with that place?

           She points to a DARK HOUSE on the corner. It’s the one place 
           not giving out candy — a black hole in the swarm of activity.

                                 APRIL
                        Guess they’re not into Halloween.

           INT. DARK HOUSE - SAME

           A grizzled OLD MAN peers between the curtains at the parade 
           of kids passing outside. He mutters in a low, menacing tone.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Look at them out there. Little 
                        cockroaches, swarming every year like 
                        a plague. Is this a soup kitchen? Am 
                        I frigging Mother Teresa, condemned 
                        to feed the hordes of thankless 
                        shits, my only consolation the 
                        obesity that will one day suffocate 
                        their greedy hearts?
                             (then)
                        Don’t touch that light!

           His WIFE timidly backs away from a lamp. The old man peers 
           back through the curtains, distant.
                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        They’re drawn to the light. They 
                        feed off it.

           DING-DONG.

           The old man goes rigid. Someone has dared to ring his bell.

           EXT. DARK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           It’s Albert, alone on the dark porch. Heavy footsteps approach 
           inside, then suddenly the door is FLUNG open. The old man 
           peers down at Albert with unconcealed contempt.

                                 OLD MAN
                        What do you want?

           Albert hoists his pumpkin pail.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Candy, eh? Something sweet? A bit of 
                        nougat, perhaps, drizzled with caramel 
                        and smothered in rich milk chocolate?

           Albert nods emphatically.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Yes. Yes I’m sure you would.

           He SLAMS the door in Albert’s face. A moment later, he’s back.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Here’s a used stamp.

           He drops the stamp in Albert’s pumpkin and slams the door 
           again. Albert stands motionless on the porch. The old man 
           isn’t coming back.

           Albert looks around. Arranged around a fountain in the yard is 
           a precious FAMILY OF GARDEN GNOMES. Coiled nearby is a hose.

           ANGLE ON THE SIDE STREET:

           Where a COP is just parking. He spots Albert.

                                 COP
                        Hey!

           ANGLE ON THE HOUSE:

           Albert sees the cop coming and bolts. Hearing the commotion, 
           the old man storms back out. He looks up and stops, trembling.
           Swinging from the porch light by a GARDEN HOSE NOOSE is his 
           favorite gnome.

           The old man’s SCREAM can be heard for miles, as...

           EXT. MARIPOSA STREET - CONTINUOUS

           ...the cop chases Albert through the crowd, passing Roosevelt 
           and Peng as they come out of a HAUNTED HOUSE. We stick with 
           them. Peng wears his dusted wig and women’s pea coat, Roosevelt 
           is in his safari get-up. They’re twice the age and height of 
           anyone else coming out of the house — and positively giddy.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        And the old lady?! With the cat?!

                                 PENG
                        The cat! Was that thing real or what?!

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I don’t know I...
                             (suddenly self-conscious)
                        ...didn’t get a good... Hey Wren.

           Rounding the corner of the house, they bump right into Wren 
           and April.

                                 WREN
                        Have you seen my little brother?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Me? Where? In there? Why would you 
                        think I was...? No.

                                 APRIL
                             (to Peng)
                        What the hell are you?

                                 PENG
                        I’m Aaron Burr, fool. Dude who shot 
                        Alexander Hamilton. Check it: 
                        period gat.

           Tucked in his belt is an antique FLINTLOCK PISTOL.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Peng’s dad collects revolutionary 
                        antiques. They eat dinner on pewter.

                                 PENG
                        Big pimpin’, y’all.
                                 WREN
                             (to Roosevelt)
                        What are you?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I’m E.O. Wilson.
                             (crickets)
                        The naturalist?
                             (crickets)
                        He’s only, like, one of the pillars 
                        of evolutionary biology. A modern 
                        Charles Darwin, but with this whole 
                        social-constructionist... bent...

           He trails off, their perplexed stares like a black hole.

                                 APRIL
                        I’m gonna go find Albert.

           She disappears into the crowd. The others stand in awkward 
           silence a while. Finally Roosevelt works up his nerve.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I think it’s really cool that you 
                        don’t feel the need to dress sexy 
                        on Halloween like other girls.

           It just hangs there in the air. Peng smacks him.

                                 WREN
                        Thank you, Roosevelt.

           April reappears with Albert in tow.

                                 APRIL
                        Let’s get this over with.

           She charges past into the haunted house and Wren follows. They 
           disappear inside just as the COP emerges from the crowd.

           INT. HAUNTED HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s a Glad Bag and cotton cobweb sarcophagus. A mannequin in 
           a housecoat rocks in a rickety chair beneath rubber bats hung 
           from strings. A tinny tape cackles and moans in the distance.

           Albert SCAMPERS AHEAD while Wren and April stroll along, 
           taking care to show their non-fear.

                                 WREN
                        Where’d you find him?
                                 APRIL
                        Carving a cock and balls into 
                        someone’s jack-o-lantern. Judging 
                        from the detail it wasn’t his first.

                                 WREN
                        He does it every year. I guess it’s 
                        like Monet and his water lilies.

           Suddenly, a TOWERING FIGURE in a hooded cloak and carrying an 
           axe lurches into the tunnel, blocking their way. He growls.

                                 TOWERING FIGURE
                        Go no further if you don’t want your 
                        brains splattered about the room.

                                 APRIL
                        Hey, Mr. Combs.

           He pulls back his hood.

                                 MR. COMBS
                        Feck it, is it that obvious?

                                 WREN
                        A little too articulate. Americans 
                        like their psychopaths semi-
                        retarded. How’s it going?

                                 MR. COMBS
                        Eh, alright. Some kid freaked out and 
                        shat his Wolverine costume. His mum 
                        said she’s sending me the bill. I 
                        told her, take the money and buy the 
                        little twat some karate lessons.

           He lights a CIGARETTE. April bums one and they both stand 
           their smoking in the trash bag tunnel.

                                 APRIL
                        You hear about Wren and Aaron?

                                 WREN
                        April!

                                 MR. COMBS
                        Course I did. Been needling me all 
                        night. Now Karen, heaven knows 
                        there’s no force of nature more 
                        powerful than peer pressure, and you 
                        wouldn’t be the first young lady 
                        tempted to trade her virtue for 
                        friends. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. COMBS (CONT'D)
                        But you listen here: if that Riley 
                        boy starts sniffing around the back 
                        door, you bury a foot in his 
                        privates. Everybody loves a 
                        Cinderella story, but a real 
                        princess keeps the party up front.

                                 APRIL
                        We’ll have to agree to disagree on 
                        that point, Mr. Combs.

                                 WREN
                        Well! I have officially been haunted. 
                        April, I think we’ve done our time.
                             (calling out)
                        Albert!

           She takes off and April follows. Mr. Combs looks down to see 
           two little WEREWOLVES (10) staring up at him, wide-eyed. He 
           takes another drag off his cigarette.

                                 MR. COMBS
                        Be right with you, lads.

           CUT TO WREN AND APRIL:

           They hustle through the rest of the house, passing more lame 
           paper-mâché zombies and talking skulls.

                                 WREN
                             (calling out)
                        Quitting time, Albert. Let’s go!

           They reach the end of the house and come out into the BACKYARD. 
           There are a couple miniature Gandalfs, but no Spider-Man.

                                 APRIL
                        You really should consider one of 
                        those electric dog collars.

                                 WREN
                        He must still be inside. Wait here.

           She storms back into the haunted house, her jaw clenched in 
           irritation.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                             (calling out)
                        Let’s go, Albert! You can sit 
                        inside a garbage bag at home.

           She passes back by Mr. Combs, who’s now teaching the little 
           werewolves to SMOKE. They both cough.
                                 MR. COMBS
                        Easy, now. It’s just like drinking 
                        a milkshake.

           Wren finally finds Spider-Man in the cardboard graveyard, 
           petting a TAXIDERMIED CAT. She drags him off by the wrist.

                                 WREN
                        I want to thank you, Albert. If it 
                        weren’t for you always doing shit 
                        like petting a dead cat, I might 
                        never have gone to college.

           Spider-Man struggles.

                                 SPIDER-MAN
                        You’re not my mommy.

           Wren stops. Did he just talk? She takes a closer look at him, 
           and only then does she notice the saggy pajama bottoms, the 
           fuzzy slippers. The two arms.

           Wren kneels and pulls up his mask.

           This Spider-Man is a SPIDER-GIRL. Not to mention, black.

                                 SPIDER-GIRL
                        Bitch.

           Wren takes off through the house, back toward the front. A 
           growing sense of dread comes over her. She walks faster and 
           faster, back through the butcher paper cave, the hall with the 
           green glowing eyes. No Albert.

           In her panic, the haunted house seems TRANSFORMED. That lame 
           fake crow suddenly looks menacing, that chattering plastic 
           skull, mocking. The cackling tape echoes louder and louder in 
           her head. Little kids seem to point and laugh. Her world spins.

           Wren backs into a witch with a mop for hair. Shrieking violins! 
           She flails, getting tangled in a cotton web. The trash bag 
           ceiling is falling in on her. The fake smoke is choking her.

           EXT. HAUNTED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Wren bursts out into the night, a lumbering cotton, plastic 
           spider and Glad Bag mummy. Children SCREAM.

           She tears the crap from her face and scans the street. It’s 
           still packed, a living Where’s Waldo of costumed kids — with 
           no fewer than 20 SPIDER-MEN in immediate sight.
           Wren runs around YANKING UP SPIDER-MASKS. Kids cry, parents 
           curse. There are freckly Spider-Men — tall, fat, Indian, 
           toothless. One is 40 years old with a mustache.

           But no Albert.

           Wren reaches the end of Mariposa, where traffic barriers mark 
           the boundary of Official Halloween. Beyond, the crowd thins 
           and the houses are dark. Even the lawns look less green. It’s 
           as if there were an invisible curtain separating the warm, 
           happy dream world from cold, hard reality.

           Wren peers into the drab darkness. Suddenly it’s deathly 
           quiet. Her shoulders slump.

                                 WREN
                        Albert?

           He’s gone.

           INT. BRUEDER’S BASEMENT REC ROOM - EVENING

           Keevin leads Joy through a packed PARTY. There isn’t a soul 
           over 30, and some of the girls look just out of college. Most 
           follow the April school of costume design, minus a few years’ 
           inhibition. Black bustier + gavel = Judge. White camisole + 
           spatula = Chef. Seeing them, Joy hikes up her plaid skirt.

           Out of nowhere, a beefy, red-faced CAVEMAN tackles Keevin to 
           the ground. Joy stands by smiling awkwardly as they wrestle.

                                 CAVEMAN
                        Say it! Say it!

                                 KEEVIN
                             (struggling, then relenting)
                        You’ve got guns of steel, balls of 
                        brass! I bow before the altar of 
                        your manhood!

           The caveman lets up and they come up laughing and hugging.

                                 KEEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Joy, say hello to my brother by 
                        another mother, Nate Brueder.

           Suddenly Brueder, the caveman, is a fawning gentleman. He 
           takes Joy’s hand and kisses it.

                                 BRUEDER
                        At long last we meet. The lovely 
                        Candice.
                                 KEEVIN
                             (cautioning)
                        Brue...

                                 JOY
                        Actually, my name is J--

           Right then, another big dude in a BLUES BROTHERS costume 
           joins the group. He wraps a big arm around Keevin’s neck.

                                 BLUES BROTHER
                        Is it true? She’s here?

           He sees Joy and stops.

                                 BLUES BROTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Keevin, you found her. You 
                        finally found her...
                             (dropping to one knee)
                        Candice.

                                 KEEVIN
                        Fellas, come on.

                                 JOY
                        Keevin?

           She looks to him for an explanation.

                                 KEEVIN
                        I used to... the guys seem to think...

                                 BLUES BROTHER
                        Whoa, think? We saw it with our own 
                        eyes, bro. And we almost went blind.

                                 KEEVIN
                        Hey Joy, how about a Cosmo?

           He tries to drag her away, but Brueder steps in. He’s giddy.

                                 BRUEDER
                        See, back in high school, young 
                        Keevin was a model student. Honor 
                        Roll, Dean’s List. And disciplined. 
                        The rest of us’d be out chugging 
                        Olde E from sundown and he’d never 
                        show his face a minute before 10:30. 
                        Even Friday night. 10:30.
                                 BLUES BROTHER
                        But the night we won State, best 
                        fucking lax team in the entire 
                        state!, and Keevin goes home to 
                        read Faulkner or some shit, we said 
                        enough is enough, and went to roust 
                        him out of his nerd cave.

                                 BRUEDER
                        The whole team, all 25 of us, start 
                        ringing his doorbell. No one answers, 
                        so we go around back. Keevin’s room 
                        had a big sliding door, and we were 
                        gonna break it down and haul his ass 
                        out if we had to. Well as we’re 
                        getting closer, we hear a voice, a 
                        woman, and we’re all, that little 
                        bitch!, he’s got a secret girl!

                                 BLUES BROTHER
                        So we sneak up, thinking maybe we’ll 
                        catch a little showtime, right?  
                        Wittaker even had his camera. We all 
                        lean in, crawling over each other to 
                        see, trying not to bust up, but it’s 
                        dark in there, just the glow of the 
                        TV going in and out, then suddenly it 
                        lights the place up and we see.

           Brueder puts an arm around Keevin, who covers his eyes.

                                 BRUEDER
                        Our star middie, alone on the bed, 
                        with a big jug of Lubriderm.

                                 JOY
                        You mean he was...

                             (miming it)
                        Practicing his stick work.

                                 JOY
                        So... you caught a teenage boy 
                        masturbating. I’d be more surprised 
                        if you hadn’t.

                                 BLUES BROTHER
                        Nah, it’s not what he was doing. 
                        It’s what he was doing it to.
                                 BRUEDER
                        We’d figured 10:30 was his dad’s 
                        rule, a real hard-ass, but turns out 
                        that’s just when Keevin was finished, 
                        ahem, enjoying his favorite show.

                                 JOY
                        What, Baywatch? Charlie’s Angels, what?

           Keevin shrugs, sheepish, and finally looks her in the eye.

                                 KEEVIN
                        Murphy Brown.

           The guys go nuts, jumping on him and laughing. He play-fights 
           back and soon they’re on the floor wrestling again.

           Joy just stares off.

                                 JOY
                        Candice Bergen?

           EXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT

           Wren and April are in a deserted park. Wren is frantic. She 
           checks under the jungle gym, inside the crawl tunnel. April 
           loiters nearby, not helping.

                                 WREN
                        That little fucker. He does 
                        whatever the hell he wants and 
                        leaves me to scoop up his crap.

                                 APRIL
                        This is why from an early age I 
                        urged my mother not to have another 
                        kid. You never know what’s gonna pop 
                        out of there the next time.

                                 WREN
                        This is bad, April. Really, really bad.

                                 APRIL
                        You are so glass half empty. Now 
                        you’re free to go hump Aaron.

                                 WREN
                        I can’t think about that right now! 
                        I just lost my little brother.

                                 APRIL
                        Come on, what’s the worst that 
                        could happen to him?
           Wren looks at her like, do I have to say it?

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        Hey, take it from someone who was 
                        almost kidnapped and/or groped five 
                        separate times growing up: the kid 
                        ain’t got it.

                                 WREN
                        What are you, a pedophile talent scout?

                                 APRIL
                        I’m just saying. These freaks are 
                        out there looking for a blank 
                        canvas. For soft, moldable clay. 
                        Trying to corrupt Albert is like 
                        farting on a skunk.

                                 WREN
                        It’s not Albert I’m worried about. 
                        I was supposed to be all 
                        responsible tonight, remember? My 
                        mom finds out I fucking lost my 
                        little brother, there’s no way in 
                        hell she’ll sign my loans.

                                 APRIL
                        Relax, she’s not gonna find out. 
                        We’ll ask around. I’m sure 
                        someone’s seen him.

           BUZZ-BUZZ.

           EXT. SHADY HOUSE - NIGHT

           A decidedly grungier part of town. Streetlights are out, weeds 
           grow up through the sidewalk. Where there is a sidewalk.

           The porch light comes on and the screen-less screen door swings 
           open to reveal a tall SCHLUB in a too-small bathrobe. He’s 25, 
           with a bewildered look on his pasty face. If he’s been out of 
           the house in the last week, it was only to score more bud.

           It takes him a full ten seconds to notice the four-foot Spider-
           Man on his doorstep. Albert gives a squirt from his stump.

                                 SCHLUB
                        Whoa. Wounded in battle?

           Albert nods. Yep.
                                 SCHLUB (CONT’D)
                        Who was it, the Green Goblin or 
                        that lunatic Doctor Octopus?

           He asks like he means it, not humoring a child. Albert puts a 
           finger to his mouth like a fang.

                                 SCHLUB (CONT’D)
                        Venom?! Oh man, you must’ve been 
                        freaking out!

           Albert shrugs. No biggie.

                                 SCHLUB (CONT’D)
                        Well you’re a bigger man than me. 
                        Anyway, it’ll grow back soon. 
                        That’s one benefit of having 
                        mutated arachnid DNA.

           Albert holds up his pumpkin.

                                 SCHLUB (CONT’D)
                        Of course, you need to feed. Hang on.

           INT. SHADY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The schlub scours his place for treats. It’s a dark, dank den. 
           Third-hand furniture, carpet ground down by years of shuffling. 
           All the shades are drawn, and the only light is the glow of the 
           70-INCH FLAT-SCREEN — a monument to stonerly sacrifice.

           He searches his cabinets. There’s a can of tuna, a flavor 
           packet from a thing of Ramen and a jug of Country Time 
           lemonade mix. A critter scurries to hide.

           The schlub nearly grabs a brownie from a half-eaten tray, but 
           reconsiders.

           EXT. SHADY HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER

           The schlub reappears with a sack of C&H Sugar and pours it 
           straight into Albert’s pumpkin.

                                 SCHLUB
                        Just main-line it, right?

           Albert nods happily.

                                 SCHLUB (CONT’D)
                        I’m Fuzzy, what’s your name?

           From inside the house comes a woman’s SCREAM, followed by 
           SHOUTING and GUNFIRE.
           Albert peers into the dark room.

                                 FUZZY
                        You play Aggravated Assault?

           Albert jams his arm through his shredded stump and proudly 
           displays two callused thumbs.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        Then come on in.

           EXT. SHINGLE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wren and April talk to a MIDDLE-AGED MAN in a bulky cardigan 
           at his front door. He eyes them with growing unease.

                                 WREN
                        ...He’s about yay high, full-
                        figured, outie belly button you can 
                        see right through a shirt. If you 
                        get real close his breath smells 
                        like those rail ties, like the pier.

                                 APRIL
                        Creosote.

                                 WREN
                        Yeah, creosote. Also, he’s dressed 
                        like Spider-Man with a torn-off arm.

           EXT. STUCCO HOUSE - NIGHT

           Now they talk to an OLD WOMAN in curlers.

                                 WREN
                        Sorry to wake you. We were 
                        wondering if --

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Wait right there.

                                 WREN
                        Wait, ma’am, I just...

           The woman disappears into the house. A moment later, she 
           returns with a TRAY.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Just one, please.

                                 WREN
                        Actually, we’re not here to trick 
                        or treat, we’re...
           Wren finally glances down at the tray. It’s covered with MEAT.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        You’re giving out pork chops?

           EXT. BLUE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Now they talk to a BLACK COUPLE (40s). Wren shows them a 
           SCHOOL PHOTO of Albert in a sweater vest. His mischievous 
           grin suggests he knows something the photographer doesn’t.

                                 WREN
                        This is before he got really into 
                        cheese. Imagine nine or ten extra 
                        pounds, mostly up here.

           She motions to her chest. April turns to her, realizing.

                                 APRIL
                        It’s true, he does have little man-
                        boobs.

                                 WREN
                        No seriously, they’re at least B-cups.

                                 APRIL
                        Is your mom concerned?

                                 WREN
                        She says we shouldn’t shame him. But 
                        then he saw this movie on Cinemax 
                        and started trying to lick them.

                                 APRIL
                             (like it’s common)
                        Mmm.

           BANG. The door slams shut. They stand there staring at it in 
           silence a while.

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        So can he?

                                 WREN
                        What?

                                 APRIL
                        Lick them?

           The porch light goes out.

           BUZZ. Now they wait at the front door of a familiar house. No 
           one’s answering.

                                 APRIL
                        I think we should split up, cover 
                        more houses.

                                 WREN
                        Let me guess — so you can go to the 
                        party?

                                 APRIL
                        It’s at a house.

           She massages the arches of her calf-high boots, groaning.

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        These fuck-mes are fucking killing me.

                                 WREN
                        I need your help, April. We need to 
                        find my brother.

                                 APRIL
                        Then we need a car.

           Wren hits the buzzer one more time. Nothing. She sighs.

                                 WREN
                        Alright. Who do we know with a car?

           They turn and head down the stairs.

           INT. FUZZY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The familiar house is Fuzzy’s. He and Albert are sprawled out 
           in beanbags in front of the giant TV playing Aggravated Assault 
           — a game that makes Grand Theft Auto look like Mario Kart.

           Under ear-splitting gunfire and screeching tires, we hear the 
           faint DOOR BUZZER, then the girls’ footsteps disappearing down 
           the stairs.

           Fuzzy pulls off his World War I GAS MASK, the kind with two 
           glass eyeholes. Where the filter should be is a giant BONG.

                                 FUZZY
                        Did you hear something?

           Albert ignores him, finishing off Fuzzy’s character in a hail 
           of bullets. Fuzzy convulses with the action, then falls limp.
           He considers his tiny companion. Albert’s got his Spider-mask 
           pushed up over his forehead now.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        There’s a lot of anger in those 
                        little thumbs. Anything you want to 
                        talk about?

           Albert just stares at the TV, starts another game. His ON-
           SCREEN CHARACTER, a thick-necked black guy, announces himself.

                                 ON-SCREEN CHARACTER
                        Motherfuckin’ Ray-Ray. Let’s roll.

           Albert concentrates on the game, putting Ray-Ray behind the 
           wheel of a big gold Lincoln.

                                 FUZZY
                        I know how it is. I cage my rage, 
                        too. That’s what Philip says. I lock 
                        it up where it can’t be seen, but 
                        also where it can’t fly away.
                             (beat)
                        Philip is my therapist.

           Albert rolls down a wide boulevard, scanning for victims.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        I had this girlfriend. Lara. Like 
                        Lara Croft. She was blonde, though. 
                        We used to have a lot of fun 
                        together. Not like that. I mean, 
                        also like that, but not because of 
                        that, or also because of that, but 
                        not only because of that. You know? 
                        It was special.

           Albert turns down a dark alley. Thugs huddle around a trash 
           can fire.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        I guess she didn’t see it that way, 
                        because she started banging the 
                        lead singer of this death-ska band. 
                        Guy named Barf. His entire left arm 
                        is a tattoo of Joey Ramone made out 
                        of flames. I couldn’t compete with 
                        that, so I let her go.

           He hangs his shoulders, glum.
           In the game, Albert steers right into the front window of a 
           barber shop, impaling the barber on his hood ornament and 
           splattering his face across the windshield like a melon.

                                 RAY-RAY (O.S.)
                        Yeah, ain’t nothin’ sweeter than 
                        motherfuckin’ payback, ‘cept sweet-
                        ass pussy.

           Fuzzy looks up, a light in his eye.

                                 FUZZY
                        I hear what you’re saying, Ray-Ray. 
                        You’re saying, grief is like an old 
                        blanket, familiar and safe, but also 
                        the reason you spend Saturday nights 
                        on the couch watching Animal Planet. 
                        You can hide under it, or you can 
                        fold it up, put it back in the linen 
                        closet and face down your sadness.

           Albert hits a button on his controller.

                                 RAY-RAY (O.S.)
                        Whatchoo waitin’ on, then? Make a 
                        move, cracker!

           Fuzzy struggles out of the beanbag as dramatically as he can. 
           He puffs up his chest and ties his too-small bathrobe like a 
           samurai.

                                 FUZZY
                        Yes. The time has come to uncage 
                        the rage.

           ...immediately following one more hit off the gas mask bong.

           EXT. MODEST HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mr. Jake opens the door to find Wren on his doorstep. He 
           seems preoccupied, stressed, but smiles to see her.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Wren? What are you doing here?

           He tempers his voice and comes outside, closing the door 
           behind him. When he sees April, he double-takes.

                                 MR. JAKE (CONT’D)
                        April, hey...

                                 APRIL
                        Hi, Mr. Jake. Do you like my costume?
           She bats her eyes and gives a vampish twirl. Mr. Jake looks her 
           up and down. His eyes linger just a little too long.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Sure, you’re a cat?

                                 APRIL
                        A cat in heat.

           For a moment, Wren feels invisible. They’re interrupted by a 
           haggard WOMAN’S VOICE calling from inside.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Jake?

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Just a second, babe.
                             (then to girls, grim)
                        Sorry, we’re passing the talking stick.

           He’s actually holding a STICK. It’s apparently not going well.

                                 WREN
                        I’m sorry to barge in, Mr. Jake, but 
                        I didn’t know who else to turn to. 
                        We kind of... misplaced my brother.

                                 APRIL
                        He might have run away, but we 
                        can’t start celebrating just yet.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        So you need to find him before your 
                        mom finds out.

                                 WREN
                             (relieved he gets it)
                        Yes! This would be the nail in my 
                        coffin. Just when I’m almost free.

                                 APRIL
                        It’s like getting caught with a 
                        shiv up your butt the day before 
                        you’re up for parole.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        What can I do?

                                 WREN
                        Drive us around? He’s probably just 
                        up on 3rd, or maybe Elmwood. I don’t 
                        know. He’s quick for a fat dwarf.
                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Jake? Who’s out there?

                                 MR. JAKE
                             (calling back)
                        That’s a lot of talking for someone 
                        not holding the talking stick!

           He sighs and takes Wren aside, giving April an imploring look.

                                 MR. JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry April, could we...?

           April backs away, offended.

                                 APRIL
                        Oh sure, just talk about me while 
                        I’m right here.

           Mr. Jake stands close to Wren and talks under his breath.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Charlene found your note.

                                 WREN
                        What note?

                                 MR. JAKE
                        You know, “Racehorse Names I Could 
                        Have Sworn Were Sex Moves”? Spanish 
                        Chestnut, Seabiscuit... I guess that 
                        would be like a Hot Lunch on a boat.

                                 WREN
                        That wasn’t a note, that was a 
                        list. And it wasn’t intended for 
                        public consumption.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        In any case, Char wasn’t amused. 
                        It’s not just the sex stuff. She 
                        really loves horses.

           Right then CHARLENE (34) flings open the door. She’s thin and 
           blonde, with pretty but harsh features. Dark bags circle her 
           eyes. She takes in the scene in disapproving silence.

           She maintains that silence until she’s marched up to Jake and 
           YANKED the stick out of his hand.
                                 CHARLENE
                        If you’re not back inside by the time 
                        my cocoa’s finished microwaving, you 
                        can make up the cot in the garage.

           She stomps back inside, calling out a moment later.

                                 CHARLENE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        56 seconds!

           Mr. Jake gives Wren a resigned look.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        I’m sorry, family bullshit of my own. 
                        Call me if you really get stuck.

           He heads inside, but stops in the doorway.

                                 MR. JAKE (CONT’D)
                        By the way, Wren, awesome Carrie 
                        costume.

           Wren smiles. Someone finally got it.

           Mr. Jake goes inside and shuts the door. They’re on their own.

           EXT. FUZZY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Albert waits on the passenger side of a big blue SUBURBAN as 
           Fuzzy struggles to steer his key into the driver-side door. 
           He shuts one eye to focus and circles the keyhole.

           Finally he gets it and jams it in, but the key sticks halfway. 
           Fuzzy looks up at the giant blue truck, blinks.

                                 FUZZY
                        Oops.

           He yanks the key out.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        Wrong car.

           INT. FUZZY’S DATSUN - MOMENTS LATER

           Now Fuzzy is folded into the driver’s seat of his TINY WHITE 
           DATSUN, Albert at his side. Marshalling all his 
           concentration, Fuzzy pulls slowly out of his parking space.

           Suddenly, he SLAMS on the brakes and leans on his horn. He 
           YELLS out the window.
                                 FUZZY
                        Slow down, asshole!
                             (then, to Albert)
                        Can you believe that guy?

           The street is empty.

           EXT. MARIPOSA STREET - NIGHT

           Wren and April trudge back to Mariposa. It’s deserted now — 
           the magical glow from before is gone. All but a couple houses 
           are dark, their jack-o-lanterns snuffed out, their motion-
           sensor skeletons turned off. Candy wrappers litter the grass.

                                 APRIL
                        I saw chub, Wren. Mr. Jake had a 
                        full-on pajama gopher.

                                 WREN
                        You are so full of yourself. Mr. 
                        Jake isn’t like that.

                                 APRIL
                        Hey, I know wang when I see it. 
                        It’s one of my talents.

                                 WREN
                        Whatever, I have more to worry about.

           Wren hurries on, clearly bothered. April stops altogether.

                                 APRIL
                        Alright, I wasn’t gonna bring this 
                        up, but it’s reached crisis stage: 
                        I Naired my butt this afternoon and 
                        now it’s chafing something fierce. 
                        Time to call the police.

                                 WREN
                        No way. The first thing they’ll do 
                        is call my mom.
                             (then)
                        Hey maybe could your mom drive us? 
                        I mean, if she’s...

                                 APRIL
                        Upright? She was six tallboys deep 
                        when I left the house. Has your mom 
                        ever burped your curfew? It’s not 
                        as awesome as you might think.

           Across the street, two people walk along in heated discussion. 
           It’s Roosevelt and Peng.
                                 ROOSEVELT
                        It wasn’t just NAFTA, but a WTO 
                        resolution that endorsed a 
                        transcontinental corridor. We can’t 
                        forget that in our cross-ex. 

                                 PENG
                        Chill, Ro. It’s Westlake. Remember 
                        last year when that fool Jared Koch 
                        was all, “State guardianship statutes 
                        supersede a minor’s right to self-
                        determination”? Honky please!

           By the time April realizes what’s happening, it’s too late. 
           Wren darts across the street, a smile plastered on her face.

                                 WREN
                        Roosevelt! Peng! Hey guys, what’s 
                        going on?

           They freeze. Is she talking to a different Roosevelt and Peng?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        We were just... going over our 
                        strategy for tomorrow’s match.

                                 WREN
                        Fencing?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Debate.

                                 PENG
                        First junior co-captains in school 
                        history.

           They share a completely serious high-five.

                                 WREN
                        Wow. I mean. Wow.

                                 APRIL
                        Um, Wren?

                                 WREN
                        So how do you get to the big match? 
                        Is there like a team bus?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I drive my car. Well not my, car, 
                        but, mine, when I... have permission.
                                 WREN
                        I thought I saw you rolling a 
                        vintage wagon last week at school.

                                 PENG
                        Roosevelt was actually born in the 
                        back seat of that Volvo because his 
                        mom has an abnormally spacious pelvis.

           Roosevelt shoots him a “what the fuck?”

                                 APRIL
                        Hey Wren, I just remembered, we 
                        have bikes --

                                 WREN
                        So could you get permission tonight?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Tonight? What’s... You want me to 
                        drive, the car, that I drive, with 
                        you... in it?

                                 PENG
                        Yo, Ro, we gotta be on the road by 7:20. 
                        7:10 if you want to stop for bagels.

           Roosevelt is torn. Peng is right, but Wren... Wren is Wren.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        The thing is, I haven’t completed 
                        my trust window.

                                 APRIL
                        Your “trust window”?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        It’s like a second learner’s 
                        permit, but between me and my moms. 
                        For six months I can’t drive with 
                        anyone outside my immediate 
                        academic and/or social circles.

           Wren takes a step closer, looks at him with puppy-dog eyes.

                                 WREN
                        But... we’re friends.

           She reaches out and very simply, very gently, TOUCHES HIS ARM.

           Roosevelt stares at her hand in awe — like a bald eagle just 
           swooped out of the sky and perched there.
           April catches Wren’s eye and shoots laser beams of disgust.

           Peng catches Roosevelt’s eye and mimes an exploding crotch.

           And Roosevelt just keeps staring at that hand.

           INT. ROOSEVELT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wren, April, Roosevelt and Peng enter the stained-glass foyer 
           of Roosevelt’s dark craftsman house. They follow his lead and 
           remove their shoes, trading them for Japanese slippers.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Is anyone here wearing perfume? 
                        Scented lotion? Deodorant?

           April raises her hand, confused.

                                 APRIL
                        Spring Rain Speed Stick?

           This seems to cause Roosevelt a degree of stress.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        OK. Just try to keep your arms down. 
                        Fragrances set off Tolstoy’s asthma.

                                 PENG
                             (off April’s baffled look)
                        The cat.

                                 WREN
                        So what’s the plan? We’re debate 
                        team cheerleaders or something?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        It’s OK. You’re my friend and you lost 
                        your brother. I never lie to my moms.

           They follow him down a hallway lined with Georgia O’Keefe 
           paintings and antique pioneer quilts.

           Prominently displayed over a Thomas Moser bureau is a large 
           framed photograph of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.

                                 WREN
                        Wow, you’re really named after 
                        Franklin Roosevelt?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Eleanor, actually.
           They round the corner and enter a dark, wood-paneled den lined 
           with floor-to-ceiling books. Seated by the fire, their backs 
           to the group, are TWO WOMEN engrossed in a lively BAROQUE 
           DUET, which they play expertly on bizarre ANTIQUE INSTRUMENTS.

           The plumper of the two, BARB (late 40s), is dressed in 
           corduroy overalls and wears her hair in a Ringo Starr bob. 

           JACKIE (50) is tall and wiry, in a calf-length denim dress 
           and clogs. Chunky wooden beads hang around her neck.

           Roosevelt waits for them to come to the piece’s end, which 
           they celebrate with an affectionate KISS.

                                 ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Moms.

           Wren and April share a look.

                                 WREN
                             (sotto)
                        I thought he was just talking like 
                        Ludacris.

           Roosevelt’s moms beam at the sight of him. Both speak in mild, 
           restrained tones, as if they lived in a library.

                                 BARB
                        Roosevelt. I didn’t expect you home 
                        until the Lehrer Report.

                                 PENG
                        Hi, Mrs. Thibodeaux.

           He says it once for both of them. Jackie admires his costume.

                                 JACKIE
                        Peng, I see you’ve inherited your 
                        father’s passion for early American 
                        iconography.

                                 PENG
                        I wanted to go as Ray Lewis, but my 
                        mom started crying. She said Ray 
                        Lewis never gave his life so we 
                        could come here from Korea.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Moms, this is Wren DeSantis and April...

           He doesn’t know her last name.
                                 APRIL
                        Martin-Danzinger-Ross. The only thing 
                        my mom loves more than men is hyphens.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Wren wants to go to NYU.

                                 JACKIE
                        How wonderful. That’s where Barb 
                        earned her third doctorate, in pre-
                        natal psychology.

                                 BARB
                        I’m still in touch with the dean 
                        through my heirloom bean club. If 
                        you like, I could put in a word.

                                 WREN
                        You would do that?

                                 BARB
                        Anything for a friend of Roosevelt’s.

           Wren smiles guiltily.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Speaking of. I’m not sure where I am 
                        on chits, but could I borrow the --

                                 JACKIE
                             (stopping him, finger in the air)
                        Tut tut. Sethn ellhnikni gloessa.

           Roosevelt smiles at the others, bashful.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Ancient Greek. It’s just this... 
                        fun thing we...
                             (launching into it with moms)
                        Tha nthela na daneistu to aytokinhto.

                                 BARB
                        Giati?

           They carry on in fluent Ancient Greek, at one point laughing 
           together at some remark. But gradually, the conversation 
           turns sour, and it’s clear Barb and Jackie disapprove.

                                 JACKIE
                        Ochi.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Parakalu?
                                 BARB/JACKIE
                        Ochi!

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        As prochwrusoyme!

           He turns and stomps out of the room. Wren, April and Peng 
           look at each other: what the hell is going on? After a 
           moment, Roosevelt reappears at the door.

                                 ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
                        I said let’s go!

           EXT. ROOSEVELT’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Roosevelt stalks out of the house, trailed by the others.

                                 WREN
                        What happened?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        It’s my fault. I completely blanked 
                        on the Ancient Greek for seat belt.

                                 WREN
                        Well now what do we do?!

           She plunks down on the curb, distressed. Roosevelt hangs his 
           head; he let her down. After a long, apprehensive beat, he 
           swallows hard — and pulls a set of CAR KEYS from his pocket.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        We drive really, really carefully.

           INT. FUZZY’S DATSUN - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Fuzzy pulls the car to a bumpy stop in front of an apartment 
           building. He nods to a light on the second floor.

                                 FUZZY
                        That’s Lara’s place up there. I 
                        know, because I used to have sex 
                        with her in it.

           Albert wipes a booger on the window.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe Barf is up there having sex 
                        with her right now. I bet he has 
                        really huge balls.

           Fuzzy shudders, his imagination getting the best of him.
                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        Well I’ll show them that even a guy 
                        with average-to-smallish-sized 
                        balls is capable of doing things 
                        which any objective observer would 
                        agree takes figuratively if not 
                        literally large balls.

           He reaches into the back and grabs a bulk pack of toilet paper. 
           Albert opens his door, but Fuzzy stops him.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        No, Ray-Ray. This is my war.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Fuzzy gets out. We now see the Datsun is parked in the MIDDLE 
           OF THE LAWN. A good-sized rose bush is pinned under one wheel.

           Fuzzy goes around to the back of the building, where he can’t 
           be seen from the street. One window is lit on the second floor. 
           He starts hucking toilet rolls up at the roof, but it’s a few 
           stories high, and the rolls fall harmlessly back to earth.

           INT. FUZZY’S DATSUN - CONTINUOUS

           Albert waits patiently. He’s added a few boogers to his 
           collection on the window.

           A SQUAD CAR stops outside on the street. The cop gets out and 
           approaches the Datsun, stopping to radio in the license plate. 
           When he turns, we get a better look at him.

           It’s the VERY SAME COP who chased Albert earlier.

           Albert’s eyes go wide. He ducks and scrambles into the back 
           seat. Just as the cop comes around to the window, Albert 
           squeezes through the armrest hole and INTO THE TRUNK.

           EXT. BACK OF THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The rest of Fuzzy’s rolls lie soggy and useless on the grass. 
           With one last dry roll, he rears back and heaves it with all 
           his might.

           The roll SMASHES through the lit window.

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The roll comes to rest on a coffee table set with wine and 
           candles. The trail of paper catches on FIRE.
           EXT. BACK OF THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The unmistakable dance of firelight flickers in the window 
           above. Fuzzy freezes. He chants to himself.

                                 FUZZY
                        Big balls, big balls, big balls...

           He looks frantically around. What now?! Over by the wall is a 
           garden hose. He turns on the water and tries to shoot it up 
           at the window, but it’s too high.

           Beside the apartment is a large oak tree. Grasping the 
           running hose between his teeth, Fuzzy starts climbing.

           This is likely Fuzzy’s first physical exertion in years, and 
           under the best circumstances the climb would be a challenge. 
           With the water splashing, his feet slipping, a pissed-off bird 
           squawking, it’s all but impossible. Halfway up, Fuzzy drops 
           the hose, then skids painfully down the length of the trunk.

           The window glows with the spreading fire. Fuzzy goes at it 
           once more, clawing his way desperately up the tree. Finally, 
           he makes it level with the window and points the hose. Still 
           too far. With a gulp, he shimmies out onto a thin branch.

           EXT. FRONT OF THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The cop greets an arriving TOW TRUCK.

           EXT. BACK OF THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Dangling from the scrawny branch, Fuzzy aims the hose inside 
           the apartment, soaking the crap out of a stereo, the couch, 
           the rug, a cat. And finally, the fire.

           Suddenly, a door inside the apartment opens. A MAN and WOMAN 
           are giggling. Fuzzy readies the hose: he’ll get them yet.

           The couple prances out in bathrobes, and immediately Fuzzy 
           knows something’s wrong. They’re both no less than 300 pounds, 
           broad, meaty, long-haired — and SAMOAN.

                                 SAMOAN MAN
                        What the fuck?

           Right then, a BLONDE WOMAN leans out the window NEXT DOOR.

                                 BLONDE WOMAN
                        Fuzzy?

                                 FUZZY
                        Lara?
           Just as Fuzzy realizes, he’s YANKED inside the building by 
           the giant Samoan.

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The Samoan body-slams Fuzzy on the floor, then raises a 
           massive foot to stomp his face. Fuzzy’s still got the hose, 
           and he sprays the Samoan in the eyes just before rolling away.

           The big Pacific Islander goes after him, up and over the 
           couch, smashing lamps, throwing picture frames and speakers. 
           Fuzzy has six near-death experiences in under a minute.

                                 LADY SAMOAN
                        Kill him, Pula’alei, kill him!

           There’s a pounding at the door.

                                 LARA (O.S.)
                        Let me at him, Mr. Mahani!

           The Samoan’s got Fuzzy cornered by the kitchen. He charges, 
           his crazy Haka eyes bulging. Fuzzy sees the hose is wrapped 
           around the table. At the last second, he pulls it taut and 
           the big man trips, going down at his feet.

           Fuzzy doesn’t wait around. He runs to the front door, flings 
           it open and runs right past Lara. She lands a few blows.

           All three chase Fuzzy down the hallway, down the stairs, 
           slapping him, throwing shoes, screaming filthy insults.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Fuzzy bursts out of the apartment, the blood-thirsty trio close 
           on his heals. He rounds the corner to the front. And stops.

           The Datsun is being TOWED AWAY. Fuzzy takes off after it. The 
           Samoans are soon out of breath, but Lara is only more enraged.

                                 LARA
                        That’s my car, you fucking prick!

           INT. FUZZY’S TRUNK - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the Datsun’s dark trunk, the voices fade into the 
           distance... as Albert is towed away.

           INT. BRUEDER’S BASEMENT REC ROOM - NIGHT

           The party’s picking up. The twentysomethings are slowly 
           abandoning their martini and stock-talk pretensions for the 
           whooping and beer sloshing of their bygone college years.
           Joy’s got a whorish NURSE trapped by the bathroom.

                                 JOY
                        People tend to forget, before she 
                        ever became Murphy Brown, Candice 
                        Bergen was considered one hot mama. 
                        Carnal Knowledge? Starting Over? Even 
                        as that reporter in Gandhi she was 
                        pretty smoking. I bet Ben Kingsley 
                        was fighting back a woody inside 
                        those diaper pants the whole time.

           The nurse sneers at her like her breath stinks.

                                 NURSE
                        What’s “Gandhi”?

           Joy just pounds the rest of her drink.

           INT. THIBODEAUX FAMILY VOLVO - DRIVING - NIGHT

           It’s a not-so-classic, powder blue ‘92 wagon. Roosevelt 
           drives exactly 25 mph down a quiet road, hands at 2 and 10. 
           He checks his mirrors obsessively and signals a block before 
           easing slowly through empty intersections.

           Wren rides beside him, Peng and April in back. They sit in 
           silence as Roosevelt lays down the law.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Rule three, part B: only one 
                        passenger may speak at a time, and 
                        then at the volume of voice you might 
                        use at a dinner party.

                                 PENG
                        Come on, Ro. Your moms don’t even 
                        know we got the car, why do we got 
                        to follow their rules?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Because one betrayal doesn’t excuse 
                        another. And I didn’t call on you 
                        to talk.

                                 WREN
                        Can we put on music?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Yeah, OK. Just no louder than 14.

           Wren beeps through the CD changer.
                                 WREN
                        These are all books on tape.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        That recording of An Inconvenient 
                        Truth is really good. It’s actually 
                        Al Gore reading.

           Wren keeps beeping. In the back seat, Peng sidles up to April.

                                 PENG
                        Check it: in addition to an IQ over 
                        140, you might be interested to know 
                        my hips and knees are hypermobile, 
                        AKA double-jointed. I don’t have to 
                        tell you what that means.

           His ankle’s already UP BY HIS EAR when April bolts forward.

                                 APRIL
                        I got about 10 minutes left in me. 
                        What’s the plan?

           Right then Wren’s phone CHIRPS with a new TEXT MESSAGE. It’s 
           from her MOM:

           “Bed time for Albert. NO MORE COFFEE! ;-p”

           Wren gulps. She sits up with new resolve.

                                 WREN
                        Let’s go to Captain Chicken. He 
                        lives for that stuff.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Despite all the trans fat?

                                 APRIL
                        I know a place we can ask 200 
                        people if they’ve seen him.

                                 WREN
                        We’re not going to the party, April.

                                 PENG
                        Pump it up, Ro, I can’t hear shit.

           Joni Mitchell sings softly in the background. Peng reaches to 
           turn it up, but Roosevelt swats his hand. The tension rises.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Only the pilot touches the controls.
                                 PENG
                        You let Wren touch it.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        She’s the co-pilot. She can operate 
                        the stereo and the dome light.

           Peng isn’t buying it. He tries again and a little nerd struggle 
           breaks out. Roosevelt pins one hand, Peng goes in with another. 
           He gets the volume way up, Roosevelt turns it way back down.

                                 ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
                        Stop messing, Peng!

                                 PENG
                        Stop being a little bitch!

           The stereo beeps and shuffles wildly. Peng latches onto the 
           volume knob and Roosevelt tries to pry him off. Finally, with 
           an elbow to his neck, he sends Peng flailing to the back seat.

           Roosevelt turns back to the stereo. The volume knob is gone. 
           And it’s stuck on EXTREMELY LOUD. They SCREAM over it.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Fantastic! You broke the stereo!

                                 PENG
                        You collapsed my windpipe!

                                 WREN
                        It’s no big deal! Just put the knob 
                        back on.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Give me the knob, Peng.

                                 PENG
                        I don’t have the knob, Roosevelt.

           He gets down on his knees to search the floor.

                                 APRIL
                        Do not touch my leg.

                                 PENG
                        Could you please turn on the dome 
                        light, Miss Co-pilot?

           A new CD starts. A booming ORCHESTRA. Tension in the car 
           mounts with the ominous music.
                                 WREN
                        Just turn it off!

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I can’t without the knob!

                                 APRIL
                        Find the knob!

                                 PENG
                        Stop saying knob!

           Outside, traffic converges into a crowded downtown area.

                                 WREN
                             (with deep dread)

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        You said Captain Chicken.

                                 WREN
                        From a side street, not the strip!

                                 APRIL
                             (tugging frantically at her door)
                        I want out! Let me out of this 
                        fucking nerd ship!

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Where?!

           They’re in bumper-to-bumper traffic funneling into a narrow 
           artery. Right then the deafening orchestra dies down, only to 
           give way to the towering vibrato of ANDREA BOCELLI, just as...

           EXT. 3RD STREET STRIP - CONTINUOUS

           ...the powder-blue Volvo enters the big downtown CRUISING 
           SCENE: a 1 mph parade of pimped out Impalas, F-150s and Civics 
           blasting Kanye, T.I. — all surrounded by hundreds of teens on 
           foot, checking each other out, peeping rides, saying whattup.

           Every single one of them stops and turns as Andrea Bocelli cuts 
           through the night on a soaring HIGH NOTE. The Volvo has reached 
           the point of no return — doomed to cruise the entire strip.
           Wren, April and Peng all sink down mortified in their seats, 
           leaving Roosevelt to bear the brunt of a thousand dumbstruck 
           stares and snarky grins.

           He tries to play it off, nodding his head to the “beat” of 
           the opera and waving to some SNEERING GIRLS.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        You should hear him live.

           INT. FUZZY’S TRUNK - NIGHT

           Albert bounces around in the dark as the car rolls over 
           something metal. Then brakes squeak and the motion stops. 
           After a beat, he peeks cautiously through the armrest hole.

           Through the dirty windshield, he can just make out the fat, 
           grease-covered TOW TRUCK DRIVER as he hops out of his cab, 
           finishes off a hip flask and tosses it aside with a crash.

           The driver stumbles off and Albert emerges from the armrest 
           hole. He’s in some kind of junkyard IMPOUND LOT. Smashed cars 
           are piled ten high beside old water heaters and rusting oil 
           drums. Beyond the rotting machines is a bleak industrial zone.

           A heavy gate SLAMS home. Albert peers through the window to see 
           the driver slap a thick padlock on the high, barbed-wire fence.

           Albert is trapped inside the impound lot.

           INT. THIBODEAUX FAMILY VOLVO - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Bocelli has mercifully moved on, only to be replaced by window-
           rattling PERUVIAN PAN FLUTES. Teens come right up to the car to 
           stare at the freaks. Cowering on the floor, April prays.

                                 APRIL
                        Please, God, if I ever make it out 
                        of here, I swear I will never talk 
                        to another nerd again.

           Right then, the Volvo STALLS. Everyone catches their breath. 
           At least the MUSIC HAS STOPPED.

                                 WREN
                        What’s happening?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                             (realizing)
                        Enallikth spasmena!

                        What?
                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Broken alternator! They tried 
                        telling me, but sometimes I mix up 
                        my declensions --

           HONK. Behind them, an enormous truck on raised shocks leans on 
           its horn. Two MEATHEADS lean out the window.

                                 MEATHEAD 1
                        Move your fucking shit, shitfuck!

                                 WREN
                        They must be late for Mensa.

           It’s all more than April can take. She breaks down SOBBING.

                                 APRIL
                        I just made it out of the lunch 
                        arbor. I was halfway across the 
                        quad. All I needed was one lesbian 
                        kiss at a party and I was on those 
                        bleachers, I was on them!

           Peng sees his opening. He sticks his head out the window and 
           screams at the truck.

                                 PENG
                        What’s up, bitches? Why don’t you 
                        get out your honky-ass truck and 
                        have nibble on this fat yellow dick!

           For a moment, there’s perfect silence. No music. No horn. Not 
           a breath from the crowd.

           Then the truck doors open.

                                 PENG (CONT’D)
                        Start the car, Roosevelt. Start it. 
                        Start the car!

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I’m trying! Maybe you’d like to get 
                        out and push, Mandingo.

                                 WREN
                        Crap, it’s Mike Puglio. Didn’t he 
                        graduate?
                                 PENG
                        Mike Puglio?! I heard he ruptured 
                        this guy’s spleen during a wresting 
                        match and the kid had to go to prom 
                        with his mom so she could drain his 
                        colostomy bag.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I heard he started taking steroids 
                        shaped like Flintstones vitamins in 
                        second grade and one day he killed 
                        the class bunny in a roid rage.

                                 PENG
                        I heard the reason he’s so screwed 
                        up is his mom is genetically a man 
                        like Jamie Lee Curtis and has a 
                        blind vagina.

           Wren and Roosevelt stop.

                                 WREN
                        What is a blind vagina?

                                 PENG
                        You know, it like... just ends.

           TAP TAP TAP. Mike Puglio, the meatier of the meatheads, raps 
           Peng’s window with his hairy knuckles. He’s dressed as an 
           American Gladiator and has veins where no human should.

           Peng lowers his window a quarter inch.

                                 PENG (CONT’D)
                        Yes?

                                 MIKE PUGLIO
                        Out of the car, pimpledick.

                                 PENG
                        Sorry, child safety locks.
                             (to Roosevelt)
                        Hey, here’s an idea. How about you 
                        start the car?

                                 WREN
                        Seriously, Roosevelt. Start the car.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Wow. Thank you for the suggestion.

           He’s been turning the engine over and over, but it won’t take.
           Right then the other meathead, dressed as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, 
           SLAMS his fists Hulk-style on the hood. The entire car shakes... 
           then suddenly the stereo speakers ERUPT in PERUVIAN PAN FLUTES.

           The car has started again.

                                 WREN/PENG/APRIL
                        Holy shit, go! Go go go!

           Roosevelt peels out, almost running the Hulk over in a cloud 
           of smoke. The parade of cars has left them behind, and the 
           street ahead is clear. The meatheads race back to their truck.

           Roosevelt speeds down the street, Rule 2G be damned. They’ve 
           only got a couple blocks before they hit the cruisers again. 
           Just when they’re running out of room, Roosevelt screeches 
           onto a side street — and immediately SLAMS on his brakes.

           The road is blocked by a GARBAGE TRUCK.

                                 PENG
                        Jump it! Jump it!

           Roosevelt looks frantically around. What now? Looming overhead 
           is the giant, motorized CAPTAIN CHICKEN mascot, with its eye 
           patch, ruffled shirt and wing-hands raising and lowering a 
           tray of drumsticks (one wing is actually a hook).

                                 ROOSEVELT
                             (nervously to himself)
                        Three-point turn, three-point turn. 
                        One, check for oncoming --

                                 WREN
                        Come on, Roosevelt!

           He stomps on the gas and sends the Volvo lurching into the 
           Captain Chicken drive-thru. Then he quickly turns off the car, 
           SILENCING the pan flutes.

           Everyone holds their breath as the meathead truck appears in 
           the intersection, then passes right by, never seeing them 
           behind the giant menu shaped like a ship.

           The intercom CLUCKS and a thoroughly lifeless GIRL comes on.

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        Welcome to Captain Chicken. What be 
                        your...
                             (sigh, then half-assed pirate accent)
                        ...arr-der?
                                 WREN
                        Have any fat, one-armed Spider-Men 
                        been through here?

           EXT. IMPOUND LOT - NIGHT

           A chubby Spider-leg steps out of the Datsun. Albert eases the 
           door open, peers out. No one there. He darts for the shadows, 
           following the sound of a TV to a small booth in the middle of 
           the lot. He stands on tip-toes to peek through the window.

           Inside the dingy shack, the tow truck driver hangs Fuzzy’s 
           keys from a peg board, digs a lint ball out of his ample 
           crack, then mixes himself a Mountain Dew and Wild Turkey in a 
           greasy mug. He kicks his work boots up in front of the TV.

           On the small black-and-white screen is a Halloween classic: 
           “CHRISTINE.” A terrified man is being chased down an alley by 
           a driverless car. The tow truck driver finds this hysterical.

           Albert creeps away, weaving through mountains of junk to find 
           the fence. It’s 12 feet high, set in concrete and topped with 
           razor wire. A bullet-riddled sign warns of 12,000 volts.

           Albert works his way along the fence, looking for an opening. 
           He TRIPS over a paint can.

           INT. BOOTH - SAME

           The tow truck driver wakes out of a drunken nap.

                                 TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                        Fucking rats.

           He grabs a crowbar and kicks the door open.

           EXT. IMPOUND LOT - CONTINUOUS

           The tow truck driver staggers around, listening for sounds.

                                 TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                        Here, ratty ratty. Got you some 
                        nice cheese.

           Something creaks and he swings wildly in the dark, SHATTERING 
           a windshield. We see little Spider-feet under the car. Albert 
           darts away.

           The tow truck driver pursues the sounds, creaming the shit 
           out of everything in his path. A fridge, a scooter, a Buick.

           Suddenly, he stops. The sounds are gone. It’s deathly quiet. 
           Then, CREAK. He swivels in time to see the BOOTH DOOR MOVE.
           The tow truck driver charges back to the booth, crowbar ready. 
           He flings open the door.

           INT. BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Nothing. The booth is empty.

           Then he sees it: a KEY MISSING from the peg board. The tow 
           truck driver grins wickedly, reaches behind the desk... and 
           pulls out a very large SHOTGUN.

           EXT. IMPOUND LOT - CONTINUOUS

           CHK-CHK. The driver cocks his big gun and scans the lot. It’s 
           silent. He works his way along the fence, looking for breaches. 
           He passes under a vapor lamp and stops. There’s something at 
           his feet. He bends to pick it up. It’s a box of RAISINS.

           Suddenly, he’s bathed in the glare of TWO HEADLIGHTS. A big 
           CADILLAC across the lot roars to life, lays down a patch and 
           launches forward. It’s headed right at him.

           The tow truck driver raises his shotgun. His finger squeezes 
           the trigger. But then, squinting into the glare, he sees it:

           The Cadillac has no driver.

                                 TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                             (utterly quaking)
                        C-C-Christine.

           Urine trickles down his pant leg, filling his shoe. He 
           trembles, unable to move.

           At the last second, just as he’s about to be mowed down, the 
           Cadillac swerves and CRASHES THROUGH THE GATE.

           As it passes, we see a small, Spider-gloved MIDDLE-FINGER held 
           high in the window.

           The big Cadillac carves a smoking arc in the street, side-
           swipes a couple cars, then races out of sight.

           INT. THIBODEAUX FAMILY VOLVO - NIGHT

           The drive-thru girl, wearing glasses over an eye patch, looks 
           on in dull bewilderment as Roosevelt and friends roll past 
           the window blasting BOBBY MCFERRIN.

                                 APRIL
                        That’s it, I’m done. Dad? Unlock me.

           Roosevelt reaches for the switch.
                                 WREN
                        No!

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        You’re right, we should park first.

                                 WREN
                        I need your help, April! You’re my 
                        best friend!

                                 APRIL
                        Which is why it’s my duty to tell you 
                        you’re one more world-music jam from 
                        total social suicide. Roosevelt?

                                 WREN
                        Do not let her out!

           The car behind them HONKS. April starts to climb out the 
           window. Wren grabs at her ankles.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        Stop her, Peng!

           Peng reaches for her feet.

                                 APRIL
                        Let me go and I’ll let you touch my 
                        boob for ten seconds.

                                 PENG
                        Twenty.

                                 APRIL
                        Done.

           Peng kicks back, pleased.

                                 WREN
                        Help me, Roosevelt!

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I’d really prefer if this could 
                        wait till we’re in park!

           April’s halfway out of the window. Wren’s got her by the cat 
           tail. A chorus of HONKS blares from behind. Roosevelt pulls 
           forward while simultaneously trying to calm everyone. He’s 
           turned all the way around when Peng suddenly screams.

                                 PENG
                        Watch out!
           Roosevelt SLAMS on the brakes just in time.

           Right in their path, blocking the exit, is the MEATHEAD TRUCK.

                                 MIKE PUGLIO
                        Thought you ditched us, didn’t you, 
                        asstits?

           Roosevelt honks politely. Little toots. He tries to go around 
           them, but they pull forward, revving their massive engine. He 
           backs up and goes the other way, but they block him there, too.

           A large CROWD gathers in the street.

           Inside the Volvo, Bobby McFerrin’s gone falsetto and everyone 
           is yelling at once.

                                 WREN/APRIL/PENG/ROOSEVELT
                        Just back up! / Go around, over 
                        there! / Fuck this, just ram ‘em! / 
                        Dinner party! Dinner party!

           They’re off the pavement now and on the lawn in front of the 
           restaurant. Inside, customers are pressed against the window. 
           The Volvo’s wheels spin out, pelting the building with turf.

           Mike and the Hulk are having the time of their lives.

                                 HULK
                        Fuck yeah! Suck it, doucheturds!

           Finally, Wren spots an opening between two parked cars.

                                 WREN
                        Right there! Go go go!

           Roosevelt stomps on the gas. But in the confusion, he never 
           got out of reverse...

           EXT. CAPTAIN CHICKEN - CONTINUOUS

           The Volvo shoots backward and SLAMS into the big metal pole 
           supporting Captain Chicken. The back of the car crumples. 
           Broken glass rains to the ground.

           Then, silence. The crowd of hundreds stares in shock. Mike and 
           the Hulk gape in delighted disbelief. Roosevelt slowly wilts.

           The only sound in the still night is an eerie CREAK — like 
           metal bending, growing higher and louder, until suddenly...

           CRASH! Captain Chicken comes smashing down onto the Volvo.
           INT. THIBODEAUX FAMILY VOLVO - CONTINUOUS

           The Captain’s hook PIERCES the roof between Roosevelt and 
           Wren and the whole back CAVES IN. They react as you only 
           could if a two-ton pirate bird landed on top of your car.

           EXT. CAPTAIN CHICKEN - CONTINUOUS

           The Captain comes to rest face down on the car, feet dangling 
           off the back. His motorized wings, stuck in the roof, pull his 
           whole torso up and back, up and back, up and back.

           In other words, it looks like Captain Chicken is doing the 
           Volvo from behind.

           Creak, creak, creak. He keeps going at it, rocking the Volvo’s 
           shocks. Even his plastered grin seems a little wider.

           The crowd’s silence finally breaks — into UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. 
           People double over, losing it. Mike and the Hulk are out of the 
           truck, pointing, beside themselves. They can hardly breathe. 

                                 MIKE PUGLIO
                        Oh God...! I’m gonna...! I’m gonna 
                        crap my pants!

           INT. THIBODEAUX FAMILY VOLVO - CONTINUOUS

           The four stare out at the merciless crowd as the car continues 
           to BUCK with each thrust. Fear and shock turn to shame. Hot, 
           bitter shame. April WEEPS uncontrollably. Roosevelt stares at 
           the wheel, his hands still at 2 and 10. His lip quivers.

                                 WREN
                        I am so, so sorry. I never meant --

           Roosevelt waves her off: don’t.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell your moms it was all my 
                        fault. I made you do it.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        You didn’t make me do anything. I 
                        wanted to.

                                 APRIL
                             (cry-talking, hysterical)
                        Oh really?! You wanted to spend 
                        Halloween driving all over town in 
                        a rolling kick-me sign?
                                 WREN
                        Come on, April.

                                 APRIL
                        You wanted to destroy whatever 
                        pathetic excuse for a social life 
                        you ever had?

                                 WREN
                        That’s enough!

                                 APRIL
                        You wanted to get fucked up the ass 
                        by a giant fucking pirate bird?!

           Finally she’s silenced by a SLAMMING DOOR.

           It’s a moment before they realize: Peng is out of the car.

           EXT. CAPTAIN CHICKEN - CONTINUOUS

           Mike Puglio looks up from his laughing fit to see a defiant 
           Peng standing over him in his Little League pants and wig. 
           Peng locks his knees to keep them from trembling.

                                 MIKE PUGLIO
                        What the...? Look, everybody! It’s...
                             (Charlie Chan accent)
                        ...Reorge Rashington.

           The crowd titters. Roosevelt and Wren jump out of the car.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Peng? Get back in the car.

                                 MIKE PUGLIO
                        Listen to ‘em, Reorge, before you 
                        get yourself hurt.

           Peng says nothing, just reaches into his coat and pulls out the 
           FLINTLOCK PISTOL.

                                 MIKE PUGLIO (CONT’D)
                        Uh oh, he’s packing heat. Now hang on, 
                        you gotta give me a fighting chance. 
                        Let’s settle this like gentlemen.

           He reaches into someone’s chicken bucket and pulls out a 
           THIGH, gripping it in two hands like a pistol. He stands with 
           his back to Peng.

                                 MIKE PUGLIO (CONT’D)
                        Count us off!
           The Hulk leaps up on the truck’s hood.

                                 HULK
                        One! Two! Three!...

           The crowd COUNTS in unison. Mike paces stiffly away from Peng.

                                 WREN
                        Ignore him, Peng. Just walk away.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Losers talk, winners walk, buddy.

           Peng doesn’t budge. He strains to hold the big flintlock 
           steady as the crowd shouts the final count.

                                 CROWD
                        ...Eight, nine, ten!

           Mike spins around. The crowd holds its breath. For just a 
           moment, there’s a glint of wonder in Mike’s eye: will he?

           No, he won’t. The pistol sags in Peng’s hand and a TEAR 
           streaks down his cheek.

           Mike smirks. He raises the chicken thigh, takes careful aim 
           and pulls the imaginary trigger...

           CRACK! A real shot cuts through the night. The crowd gasps. 
           Mike sees the smoke rising from Peng’s gun before he realizes:

                                 HULK
                        Oh, shit! You’re fucking hit! He 
                        fucking shot you, you’re hit!

           Mike touches the side of his head and his hand comes back 
           covered in BLOOD. He gags.

           We get a quick, gruesome look: his ear is ripped in two and 
           dangles by a wisp of skin. Blood pulsates from the ragged tear.

           Peng’s determination quickly crumbles. His body quakes and he 
           drops the gun. No sooner has it hit the ground, when...

           Mike SLAMS into him like a speeding train — 250 lbs of angry 
           muscle. Peng wilts under the force and Mike is instantly on 
           top of him, stuffing his face into the dirt.

                                 MIKE PUGLIO
                        Play time’s over, asshole.

           The crowd shifts into fight mode, swarming around them and 
           chanting. Wren tries to pull Mike off.
                                 WREN
                        Leave him alone!

                                 MIKE PUGLIO
                        No way, it’s an eye for an eye, an 
                        ear for an ear.

           He’s got Peng’s ear gripped in his meaty fist and looks ready 
           to pluck it right off. Peng is in desperate tears.

                                 WREN
                        Stop it, Mike! He didn’t mean to!

                                 MIKE PUGLIO
                        Back off, bitch.

           He swats her with his free arm and sends her stumbling back. 
           She falls hard on her ass and hits her head against the Volvo. 
           But that’s not the worst of it.

           Her jacket is smeared with blood.

           Wren’s face hardens with a cold, steely rage.

           Mike never sees her coming. She’s horizontal like a 
           linebacker, and knocks him clean off Peng, pinning him to the 
           ground and tearing into him like a woman possessed — punching 
           clawing, pulling hair. Mike is helpless against the onslaught.

                                 WREN
                        It’s hard enough! It’s hard enough 
                        without dicks like you!

           She’s relentless, driven by an anger way beyond the offense. 
           The crowd turns, cheering this wild woman on, until the Hulk 
           finally pulls her kicking and screaming off his friend.

           Mike picks himself up off the ground, bloodied and embarrassed. 
           He ignores Wren, sneering instead at Peng.

                                 MIKE PUGLIO
                        Fucking pussy. Better watch your 
                        back — next time your girlfriend 
                        won’t be there to save you.

           He climbs back in the truck. With a whoop and a blast of the 
           engine, they’re gone.

           The crowd dissipates. Wren goes to help Peng up, but he shakes 
           her off.

                                 PENG
                        Leave me alone.
           Avoiding their eyes, he gathers the flintlock off the ground. 
           The hammer is broken off. Awesome. He stuffs both pieces in 
           his pocket.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Come on, we should go by Wren’s 
                        house just in case.

           They go to get in the car, but Peng hangs back.

                                 PENG
                        I’m out.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        What do you mean you’re out? We 
                        still have to find him.

           Finally Peng looks up. His eyes are full of pain.

                                 PENG
                        We? Which we? You and me, or you 
                        and her?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        You and she.

                                 PENG
                        What?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        You and she. It’s a subject 
                        pronoun, because --

                                 PENG
                        Whatever man! Until tonight there 
                        was no she. Now it’s all there is.

           Roosevelt is embarrassed to be called out. He laughs nervously.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        That’s... that’s outlandish. I 
                        don’t even... What..? Just absurd.

                                 WREN
                        We’re a team, Peng. All four of us.

           She motions to the Volvo. Only then do they realize: it’s EMPTY.

           April is gone.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        Whore!
           She pounds the roof. The Captain responds with another THRUST. 
           Peng approaches Roosevelt one on one, pleading.

                                 PENG
                        We don’t belong out here, Ro. We 
                        build homemade telescopes. We write 
                        letters to our Congressmen. We have 
                        a Final Four debate in eight hours.

           Roosevelt stops. He’d forgotten all about the debate.

                                 PENG (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go home, man. We gave it a 
                        shot, but... we’re out of our league.

           Roosevelt studies his shoes. Wren can see he’s wavering.

                                 WREN
                        I need your help, Roosevelt.

           For a long beat, they stare at Roosevelt from either side, 
           waiting. He can hardly look at Peng when he finally says:

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I’m sorry.

           Roosevelt gets in and starts the car. Immediately the chipper 
           intro to Paul Simon’s “YOU CAN CALL ME AL” blasts forth. 
           Roosevelt pulls out and Peng follows at his window, in TEARS.

                                 PENG
                             (through sobs)
                        Bros before hos, dog. Bros before hos.

           He’s still repeating it as Roosevelt turns up the street and 
           the Captain’s thrusting ass disappears into the night.

           INT. THIBODEAUX FAMILY VOLVO - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER

           Roosevelt and Wren drive in silence — apart from a THUNDERING 
           Paul Simon. Wren lays a thankful hand on Roosevelt’s arm. He 
           looks down at it with a kind of detached curiosity.

                                 WREN (V.O.)
                        Early Clues That I Couldn’t Count 
                        on April Martin-Danzinger-Ross.

            Wren stares out the window at the passing street lights.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Once shoved an entire pack of gummy 
                        worms in her mouth in order not to 
                        share. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        When she barfed it all up five 
                        minutes later it smelled exactly 
                        like peach yogurt.

           Paul Simon’s bushmen click and warble in the background.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Missed my 12th birthday party at the 
                        go kart track to see Sugar Ray play 
                        at the mall. I’m not saying go karts 
                        are all that, but Mark McGrath in 
                        front of a Sunglass Hut?

           Outside, a lowered, grape-purple CADILLAC DE VILLE pulls up 
           opposite them at an intersection. Wren stares past right it.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Has no nails on her pinky toes. None. 
                        It’s like how Whoopi Goldberg has no 
                        eyebrows. You’re looking at her and 
                        you’re thinking, I don’t know what it 
                        is, but something is terribly, 
                        terribly wrong. I’m not sure what that 
                        has to do with April laming out, but I 
                        thought it was worth mentioning.

           Wren is woken from her reverie by the Cadillac’s pounding 
           Mexican OOM-PA-PA MUSIC, which shakes the entire Volvo as it 
           rolls past. She glances at the car just in time to notice a 
           CANDY WRAPPER tossed out the window by the UNSEEN DRIVER. 
           Roosevelt shakes his head.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Litterbug.

           They drive on. Meanwhile, inside the Cadillac...

           INT. CADILLAC DE VILLE - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

           ...Albert strains to see over the chain link steering wheel of 
           his bitchin’ ride. A foot-long Jesus dangles from the rearview. 
           The dash is draped in purple shag.

           Soon Albert reaches the same CRUISING STRIP the others were 
           on. He flips a switch and the car BOUNCES. The crowd approves.

           Outside, a couple THICK BUTTS with four-inch whale-tails pass 
           in front of his hood. Albert watches, transfixed, as they 
           join other AMPLE HOOCHIES filing into a nearby club.
           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS

           The De Ville swerves across two lanes of honking traffic and 
           screeches to a halt in front of the club.

           The VALET looks on, perplexed, as a waist-high Spider-Man hops 
           out, hands him the keys and tips him a roll of SMARTIES.

           Albert ignores the line snaking around the block and slips 
           right under the BOUNCER’S nose as he’s checking an ID.

           The people in line PROTEST and the bouncer spots Albert just 
           as he disappears into the dark club. He goes after him.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS

           It’s a Halloween rave. Sweaty, costumed revelers pulse 
           against one another in a swirl of fog and flashing lights. 

           For a horny little eight-year-old, it’s a wonderland. Shrek 
           freaks Christina Aguilera. Yoda is the meat in a Hermione 
           Granger sandwich. Hannah Montana makes out with her alter-ego.

           The bouncer catches then loses sight of the tiny Spider-Man in 
           the teeming mass. Soon Spidey disappears completely.

           OVER AT THE BAR, a bartender pours FOUR SHOTS for a chick 
           dressed as Sarah Palin. Sarah digs in her purse, pulls out 
           the money, turns back to the bar, and stops.

           Now there are only THREE shots.

           AT A NEARBY TABLE, a little Spider-hand plunks down an empty 
           shot glass.

           A MOMENT AND THREE TABLES LATER, Wonder Woman turns back from 
           a conversation to find her martini drained.

           THROUGHOUT THE CLUB, beers vanish and mojitos turn up empty 
           as the phantom boozer strikes at will.

                                                               MELT TO:

           ALBERT’S POV: Light bends, music echoes. A jiggling gauntlet 
           of ass and titties passes inches before Albert’s bleary eyes 
           as he weaves through the forest of flesh. Forget Mariposa; 
           this is Albert’s Halloween dream.
           INT. VIP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A mangy dude covered in tats and dressed as DOG THE BOUNTY 
           HUNTER is getting friendly with a METER MAID on the vinyl 
           couch. Suddenly, he realizes they’re not alone. He’s got a 
           VOICE LIKE A BELCH.

                                 DOG
                        Get lost, bro!

           Lurking in the corner is a four-foot Spider-Man. He turns to go.

                                 METER MAID
                        Wait, let him stay.

           She gives Dog a randy grin.

                                 METER MAID (CONT’D)
                        Midgets are hot.

           It. Is. On.

           INT. BRUEDER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Joy picks tentatively through the quiet upstairs of Brueder’s 
           house. It’s an elegant, Spanish-style house: dark wood, tile, 
           wrought iron. Muffled party sounds continue in the distance.

           Joy finds herself snooping. Down a dark hallway she finds a 
           bedroom, flips on the light. It’s a boy’s room. Penant flags, 
           trophies, a poster of Kelly LeBrock from Weird Science.

           On the dresser is a picture of two boys, about 10, in those 
           reversible mesh soccer uniforms. It’s unmistakably Brueder and 
           Keevin. Other pictures chart Brueder’s evolution into teenage 
           beefcake. The tassel from a mortar board hangs from a lamp.

           Joy looks around the room, confused. A stuffed gorilla in the 
           corner wears a beer helmet, while the bed is shaped like a 
           Ferrari. She opens the top drawer of the dresser. Condoms.

           That’s when it hits her: he still lives here.

                                 VOICE
                        Can I help you?

           Joy slams the drawer and turns. It’s Mr. Brueder.

                                 JOY
                        Bathroom?

           He points back into the hall, waits for her to pass, then 
           turns off the light and shuts the door.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           The Brueders are talking in hushed tones when Joy enters.

                                 JOY
                        May I?

           She takes a seat on the couch before they can respond.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, that music!

           She makes a crazed face and a knowing laugh. The Brueders 
           share a private, uncomfortable look. Joy fills the silence.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        You have a beautiful home. I love 
                        these old Spanish places. They feel 
                        so... old.

           Finally, Mrs. Brueder paints on a polite smile.

                                 MRS. BRUEDER
                             (over husband’s obvious objection)
                        Would you care for some tea?

                                 JOY
                        Something that isn’t beer? Please!

           Again her knowing laughter goes unshared. Mrs. Brueder exits 
           and Joy sits in awkward silence with Mr. Brueder, who doesn’t 
           bother with the polite smile. He lets her squirm a while.

                                 MR. BRUEDER
                        So how do you know Keevin?

                                 JOY
                        Keevin teaches at my daughter’s school.

                                 MR. BRUEDER
                        You have kids?

                                 JOY
                        Two. Albert is in third grade, 
                        Karen is a senior.
                             (quickly)
                        But she’s young for her grade.

                                 MR. BRUEDER
                        Where’s your husband?

                                 MRS. BRUEDER
                        Larry!
           She’s back with the tea and a plate of cookies. Mr. Brueder 
           stares at these like an unforgivable act of betrayal.

                                 MRS. BRUEDER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. You don’t have to...

                                 JOY
                        No, it’s alright.
                             (a gulp of tea, then)
                        My husband passed away.

                                 MRS. BRUEDER
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 JOY
                        It’s OK, it was a while ago. We’ve -- 
                        I’ve, moved on. Like Keevin says, the 
                        waves’ll still be breaking tomorrow.

                                 MRS. BRUEDER
                        He always has had a sunny 
                        disposition. Even as a baby.

                                 JOY
                        You’ve known him a long time, then.

                                 MRS. BRUEDER
                        Keevin’s mother and I were freshman 
                        roommates at Vassar.

                                 JOY
                        No kidding, my sister went to 
                        Vassar! Sarah Weaver, class of ‘82?

                                 MR. BRUEDER
                        You have a sister who graduated 
                        college in 1982?

                                 JOY
                        Older sister. Oldest. I was the baby 
                        of the family. The young... baby.

                                 MRS. BRUEDER
                        How many sisters do you have?

                                 JOY
                        Just the one.

           No one speaks for half a minute. Mr. Brueder abruptly stands.

                                 MR. BRUEDER
                        I’ve got a six o’clock tee time.
                                 JOY
                        Yes, I’d better be getting home 
                        myself. If Albert doesn’t have his 
                        warm milk, he’ll never get to sleep.

           They leave the room before she does.

           INT. VIP ROOM - NIGHT

           The bouncer parts the bead entrance to the VIP room and stops. 
           Arranged before him is a bizarre TABLEAU: Dog the Bounty Hunter, 
           reclined on the couch, with a Meter Maid kneeling in front of 
           him and little Spider-Man spanking her ass with a riding crop.

                                 DOG
                        Scram, dude. Three cock’s a crowd.

                                 BOUNCER
                        I need to see some ID.

                                 DOG
                             (side of his mouth, man to man)
                        Come on, brother. Freaky booty-train 
                        don’t fall in your lap every day.

           The bouncer approaches Albert.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Let’s see it. Mask off, Webster.

                                 METER MAID
                        How dare you. As if his people 
                        don’t already have it hard enough.

                                 BOUNCER
                        I don’t remember you, either. Let’s 
                        go, IDs all around.

           Dog bolts up, pants around his ankles. It’s ALL hanging out.

                                 DOG
                        Dude! What! The! Fuck!

                                 BOUNCER
                        Five seconds, then you’re all 86’d.

           The Meter Maid pulls her ID from her bra.

                                 METER MAID
                        So this is what it feels like to be 
                        persecuted.
           Dog bends over and fishes his wallet out of his pants, not 
           bothering to pull them up.

                                 DOG
                        This ain’t right, hoss. VIP stands for 
                        one thing, and that is Vagina In Private.

           The bouncer grins as he reads the IDs.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Might wanna work that out with your 
                        friend, then.

           He hands Dog the Meter Maid’s license.

                                 DOG
                        “Lyle Burgis...” That French or 
                        something?

           A beat, then the Meter Maid finally relents, in a DEEP BARITONE.

                                 METER MAID
                        Irish, actually. Sorry, pal.

           Dog looks down at his still-bare crotch, horrified.

                                 DOG
                             (to his dick)
                        This one’s for you, Tarzan.

           He comes up SWINGING — and drops the Meter Maid with a big 
           hook to the jaw. The place immediately erupts in CHAOS.

                                 BOUNCER
                             (calling off)
                        Nick! Bo! VIP room --

           He’s DECKED by the Meter Maid, whose sleeves are now pushed 
           up to reveal a couple hairy pythons.

           The IDs scatter on the ground. Dog’s license lands right in 
           front of Albert, who huddles under the couch. He picks it up.

           The license reads: “BARF RUNNELL.”

           Albert gives Dog a second look. His entire left arm is a 
           tattoo of Joey Ramone made out of flames. As the bouncers 
           finally overpower Dog/Barf and drag him off, Albert follows.
           INT. NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS

           It’s one giant BRAWL. Albert ducks and weaves through the 
           melee, recoiling in horror as Frodo catches a beatdown from 
           Zorro and Papa Smurf wails on Tony the Tiger.

           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS

           The bouncers toss Barf into the gutter.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Tell your little band you can 
                        forget ever playing here, too.

           They head back into the fray. Barf takes it all in stride. He 
           staggers to his feet, kicks the mirror off a BMW just because, 
           and stumbles off down the street.

           From the shadow of a doorway emerges a pint-sized Spider-Man. 
           He FOLLOWS.

           INT. WREN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wren and Roosevelt enter the dark house.

                                 WREN
                        Buttmunch?

           It’s dead quiet.

           INT. ALBERT’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           They flip on the light. Albert’s big, black-sheeted bed lays 
           empty. Wren slumps down onto it.

                                 WREN
                        I give up. Evil wins.

           Roosevelt timidly sits on the edge of the bed a good four 
           feet from Wren. He nearly falls as it sags beneath him.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Your brother has a waterbed?

                                 WREN
                        He’s really excited for puberty... 
                        a terrifying metamorphosis I’ll 
                        have the pleasure to witness, now 
                        that I’m stuck here for good.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Come on, your family can’t be that bad.
           She looks at him like, are you fucking kidding me?

                                 WREN
                        A few months after my dad died, I 
                        walked in on my mom in bed with 
                        another man. It was my dad’s 
                        oncologist. Believe me, it is that bad 
                        and much, much worse. You wouldn’t 
                        understand; your family’s perfect.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Perfect? What’s perfect about 
                        having to celebrate Mother’s and 
                        Father’s Day for both your parents 
                        because they reject traditional 
                        gender roles? Or boycotting Amtrak 
                        because they still use track laid 
                        by indentured Chinese servants in 
                        the 19th century? I’ve never even 
                        met one whole side my family, who 
                        disowned my mom when they found out 
                        she was, to quote my grandmother, a 
                        “bush pilot.” And at least you knew 
                        your dad. All I know about Sperm 
                        Donor #522 is he’s a biochemistry 
                        professor at a college that 
                        consistently ranks in the US News 
                        top 20, and he plays the lute. Do 
                        you have any idea how many of those 
                        there are?

                                 WREN
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t know.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Even Peng, who’s like his family’s 
                        Jesus, can’t talk to his own 
                        grandparents on the phone because 
                        his mom and dad refused to teach 
                        him Korean. They purposely timed 
                        his conception so he’d be born on 
                        the 4th of July, then his mom drank 
                        some weird herbal potion the night 
                        before to induce labor but all it 
                        did was turn her eyes yellow. He 
                        was born on the 5th, and I’m not 
                        kidding I think they love him a 
                        little bit less for it.

                                 WREN
                        I guess every family’s fucked up in 
                        its own special way.
                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Exactly, but they’re the only family 
                        you’ve got, and like it or not, 
                        you’re hard-wired to be together. 
                        It’s like ants.

                                 WREN
                        How on earth is it like ants?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                             (nodding to his costume)
                        E.O. Wilson, he hypothesized that 
                        since ants are haplodiploid --

                                 WREN
                        Whoa, whoa. Science and I are sworn 
                        enemies. Dumb it down a notch.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Haplodiploid. It means one of their 
                        parents only supplies half a 
                        chromosome, so siblings share three 
                        quarters of each other’s genes, 
                        instead of half, like us. So ants 
                        have a huge genetic self-interest 
                        in helping each other out. They’re 
                        also helping themselves.

           Wren’s eyes are glazed over.

                                 WREN
                        One more notch.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        You are your family. Your family is 
                        you. Friends... they come and go.

                                 WREN
                        You’re still here.

           Slowly, their eyes meet. Roosevelt swallows hard. So hard you 
           can hear it. He starts coughing. There goes that moment. Wren 
           stands and paces the room.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        It’s different. We live together, but 
                        we’re not a real family. My dad was 
                        the glue, you know? When he died, we 
                        all just kind of fell apart. My 
                        brother was still a baby; I don’t 
                        think he even remembers him. And my 
                        mom... my mom just checked out. She 
                        also became a giant slut.

                        My family only takes pictures on 
                        birthdays, and I swear you can go back 
                        eight years and find a different guy 
                        in each one. Albert’s basically grown 
                        up without parents. No wonder he’s 
                        such a psycho.

           Roosevelt nods to the bookshelf.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I was kind of wondering, is that...

                                 WREN
                        A booger jar? Why yes, it is. This is 
                        just this year. The others are buried 
                        in the yard, don’t ask me why.

                        set from the daytime series Small 
                        Wonder. Remember, he’s too young to 
                        understand irony. And I hope you 
                        haven’t failed to appreciate the fact 
                        that everything is in precise 
                        alphabetical order. The crazy ones are 
                        always anal. Didn’t Jeffrey Dahmer 
                        have impeccable dental hygiene?

           Something on the shelf catches her eye.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        That little shit! I’ve been looking 
                        all over for this.

           It’s a Thin Lizzy album. She yanks it off the shelf and a PIECE 
           OF PAPER falls out. Roosevelt picks it up. There’s writing.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                             (reading)
                        “Possible Explanations for the Male 
                        Nipple...”

           Wren snatches the paper away.

                                 ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
                        What is that?

                                 WREN
                        It’s a list. It’s just something I 
                        do to make sense of things.

                        Have you lost a lot of sleep over 
                        nipples?

           Wren ignores him and drops the paper face-down on the bed. 
           Then stops.

           On the other side of the paper is a PHOTO — of Wren’s DAD. 
           About seven years ago, just before he died. He’s in a sound 
           studio, smiling wide with NINE-YEAR-OLD WREN on one knee and a 
           BABY on the other. Baby Albert.

           Despite his pallid skin and sunken eyes, Pete DeSantis is a 
           groovy-looking guy, with a short beard, earring, bandana 
           covering his hairless head, and...

                                 ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
                        Your jacket.

           It’s the same old army jacket Wren wears at all times, and at 
           this very moment.

                                 WREN
                        Actually, it was Phil Lynott’s, first.
                             (off Roosevelt’s blank stare)
                        Lead singer of Thin Lizzy? My dad was 
                        a sound engineer. He worked on an 
                        album of theirs way back. Lynott left 
                        it in the studio the last day and 
                        never came back, so my dad just kept 
                        it. Kind of the same way I ended up 
                        with it, come to think of it.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        How did he die?

                                 WREN
                        Heroine overdose.
                             (off Roosevelt’s shock)
                        Oh, my dad. Adenocarcinoma of the 
                        colon, AKA ass cancer. Found out in 
                        August, was dead by...
                             (quietly)
                        ...well, by Halloween.

           Roosevelt is startled. He had no idea.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        I guess it’s fitting, like a 
                        Catholic dying on Christmas. My dad 
                        loved candy. He had stashes all over 
                        the house.

                        Sometimes we still find Necco wafers 
                        in dresser drawers. Albert eats 
                        them.

           They’re silent a while. Roosevelt studies the picture.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        You look just like him.

           Wren flashes a rare smile.

                                 WREN
                        Yeah. Just, you know, minus the beard.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        No. I mean your brother.

           Wren sees the photo as if for the first time. It’s true. She’s 
           about Albert’s age, with the same big cheeks and bright eyes. 
           Apart from her darker hair, they could almost pass for twins.

           She’s jarred out of her reverie by her PHONE. The Caller I.D. 
           says “April.” Wren almost ignores it, but finally picks up.

                                 WREN
                        What do you want?

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - SAME

           April is in the middle of a jam-packed Halloween party.

                                 APRIL
                        He’s here!

                                 WREN
                        What?! Here?! Where?!

                                 APRIL
                        At the party! I just saw him a 
                        second ago. 54 Adeline. Hurry!

           END INTERCUT.

           EXT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           The party spills outside. People stop and stare as the Volvo-
           humped-by-a-giant-chicken rattles up blasting GREGORIAN CHANT.
           INT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS

           A hoard of drunk teens in party-worn costumes pack every inch 
           of the house. April rises from an ice luge shot as Wren and 
           Roosevelt enter. She slurs her words.

                                 APRIL
                        At fucking last! Come on, I just 
                        saw him outside.

           She drags Wren off by the wrist, leaving Roosevelt at the door.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Good idea. Split up, cover more ground.

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           April tugs Wren outside, where more teens are gathered around 
           the yard and by the POOL. She stops and beams.

                                 APRIL
                        So?

                                 WREN
                        So...

           She scans the yard, not seeing him.

                                 APRIL
                        Are you blind? On the diving board.

           She grabs her and points. Teetering back and forth on the board 
           like a plank, dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow, is not Albert, 
           but AARON RILEY.

           Wren wilts. She should have known.

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t I tell you? I’m like one of those 
                        dogs that sniffs out prized truffles, 
                        except I sniff out prized cock.

                                 WREN
                        I can’t believe I actually thought 
                        you found my brother.

           She turns to go, but April blocks her path. She sways drunkenly 
           and her eyelids sag half-shut.

                                 APRIL
                        Now you listen to me. We’ve been 
                        friends, what, 20 years?
                                 WREN
                        We’re 17.

                                 APRIL
                        And this is our last Halloween 
                        together. Our last! Hal! O! ...een! 
                        Now, did I complain when you turned 
                        our night into your own personal 
                        scavenger hunt?

                                 WREN
                        Yes. A lot.

                                 APRIL
                        Did I say a word when you stuck us 
                        with the Tri-Lams?

                                 WREN
                        Many words. Most of them obscene.

                                 APRIL
                        You’ve wasted all night searching 
                        for that ungrateful troll, now it’s 
                        time you thought about us.
                             (deep breath, big news)
                        Earlier tonight, Aaron’s best friend 
                        Jonathan brushed my boob, and I’m 
                        99% sure from the hangtime that 
                        there was willful intent. Just 
                        imagine, Wren. We could be like the 
                        Cruises and the Beckhams. Hell, one 
                        of us could even get knocked up and 
                        throw a Suri in the mix.

                                 WREN
                        You make it hard to say no. But 
                        here goes: N--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                             (singing)
                        No, no, no, don’t leave me hanging 
                        like a washcloth in a shower, daka-
                        dow bow.

           Wren turns. It’s Aaron, floating up with his “bass” in hand. 
           Somehow he manages to make Jack Sparrow even gayer.

                                 AARON
                        Or maybe, like a windsock on a pole. 
                        You know, like at the airport.

                                 WREN
                        What... I don’t...
                                 AARON
                        It’s your song, Mystery Meat. 
                        Although, I was thinking of changing 
                        it to The Girl with the Hair. Did 
                        you forget?

                        I... I guess I did.

           She blushes, suddenly in no hurry. April quietly tip-toes away.

           EXT. SCRUFFY STREET - NIGHT

           Barf PISSES into an open convertible. Two YOUNG WOMEN scoot 
           cautiously by.

                                 BARF
                        Hey hey, ladythings, how’s about a 
                        game of hide the cocktail weenie?

           They pick up the pace. Barf calls after them.

                                 BARF (CONT’D)
                        Just managing expectations!

           He rips a big FART and chuckles to himself. Then he shakes it 
           off and stumbles toward the dingy house right behind him.

           As he enters and slams the door, a little SPIDER-HEAD pops up 
           behind a car down the street.

           Albert works his way toward the house, slips through the 
           rusty gate and eases slowly onto the rotten porch.

           He peeks through the dirty window. Barf lies face down on the 
           couch, his pants halfway down, all the lights on.

           An enraged ROTTWEILER suddenly explodes into Albert’s view, 
           snapping its jaws and soaking the glass with saliva. Albert 
           stumbles backwards, TRIPPING off the porch. Barf stirs.

                                 BARF (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit, Ozzy! I’m fucking napping!

           He stumbles toward the window. Any second, he’ll see Albert 
           sprawled out in his yard.

           Suddenly, someone GRABS Albert by the collar and drags him 
           into the bushes. Albert struggles wildly, kicking the unseen 
           stranger in the shins, jabbing at the air with his fists.

                                 UNSEEN STRANGER
                        Easy, easy! It’s me, Ray-Ray, it’s me!
           His face comes into the light. It’s Fuzzy.

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Roosevelt, carrying a picture of Albert, interrogates a group 
           of sneering teens. He responds to one of the girls, droll.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Yes, I’m a cop. I’m a 16-year-old cop 
                        with no facial hair and a safari hat.

           The girl make a capital “L” on her forehead — backwards.

                                 ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
                        I’ll assume that stands for Leader.

           He turns to continue his search, and that’s when he sees it: 

           Wren, across the pool, standing close to Aaron. She touches 
           his stomach and he leans in, cooing in her ear.

           Roosevelt promptly drops to his knees and VOMITS into the pool.

           The entire party grinds to a halt — then ERUPTS in pandemonium. 
           There’s just something about vomit. People scream and run 
           aimlessly around, as if a bomb went off.

           Wren sees Roosevelt run into the house. She chases after him.

           EXT. BARF’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Fuzzy and Albert crouch in the bushes. Fuzzy hugs him.

                                 FUZZY
                        You’re a sight for sore eyes, Ray-
                        Ray. I’ve been here all night trying 
                        to work up my nerve. Check it out.

           He presents a brown paper bag. It sags.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        He shat on my life, I’m gonna shit 
                        on his.

           Albert cups the bag, weighing it. He shrugs, unimpressed.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, it’s the best I could do on 
                        short notice. Everyone has such 
                        tiny dogs these days.

           Albert reaches into his pumpkin and pulls out the black 
           plastic bag the tennis coach bought him earlier. 
           He empties the fireworks on the ground. There are SMOKEBOMBS, 
           FIRECRACKERS and big fat M-80s. Fuzzy slowly smiles.

           They tip-toe up to the porch and unfurl the bag, revealing a 
           mound of sticky shit. Using a twig, they sink an M-80 with a 
           long wick right into the middle of it.

           Fuzzy readies the lighter and Albert stands by the doorbell. 
           On three. One, two, three! The bell DINGS, the wick SIZZLES, 
           Ozzy BARKS, Barf YELLS, Fuzzy and Albert sprint for the gate.

           They’re hardly off the porch when Ozzy comes barreling out of 
           the dog door like a rabid wolf. Fuzzy and Albert run like 
           hell. The giant dog snaps at them, almost getting a piece.

           Then, suddenly, he stops. Fuzzy is halfway up the block 
           already, but Albert stops outside the gate to see.

           Ozzy is sniffing at the bag of poo. The wick burns his nose and 
           he jumps back, but a second later he’s right back in there.

           And then... he starts EATING. Just full-on mowing — ravenous, 
           greedy, like he’s gone weeks without food and the shit’s a 
           bowl of Alpo.

           Albert just watches, transfixed. It’s like a car wreck. He 
           can’t look away. Up the street, Fuzzy is whisper-yelling.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Ray-Ray! Let’s go!

           The screen door snaps open and Barf comes lumbering out. His 
           shirt is off and his big, distended gut sports an elaborate 
           Iron Maiden mural. He spots the bag, picks it up. It’s licked 
           clean. No shit, no bomb. He sniffs it. What the fuck?

           Barf peers into the darkness. Just beyond the gate, he spies 
           a familiar shape, looming like a specter. Little Spider-Man.

                                 BARF
                        You.
                             (then, menacing)
                        Ozzy? Sick. Balls.

           The  maniacal canine takes off like a bolt. Every muscle in its 
           body bulges. Rivulets of slobber whip from razor teeth flecked 
           with shit bits. Its lips quiver with hungry anticipation.

           Albert stands frozen, unable to move. The big dog bears down. 
           It’s nearly his height and twice his weight. In less than two 
           seconds, he’ll be devoured.
           Ozzy LUNGES. He soars through the air, jaws open wide. Three 
           feet from Albert, two feet, six inches, one... when suddenly:

           POP. It’s like the sound of a champagne cork released under a 
           towel, muffled but distinct. It’s followed by the dull THUD 
           of flesh on concrete.

           The dog collapses at Albert’s feet. Dead.

           Albert stares down at it, stunned. It takes a moment for Barf 
           to realize what’s happened. He stumbles off the porch, walking 
           then running. He reaches his dead pet and crouches over it. 
           SMOKE rises from the dog’s nostrils. He meets Albert’s eyes. 
           They’re a foot apart.

           In the same instant, Barf LUNGES and Albert turns to RUN. 
           But it’s too late. Barf has him firmly by the Spider-collar.

           UP THE STREET, Fuzzy watches it all go down from behind a 
           hedge, but he can’t muster the courage to help.

           EXT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           Wren runs out of the house in time to see Captain Chicken’s 
           raised ass disappear up the street. AL GORE’S VOICE echoes 
           back through the trees. Wren’s shoulder’s slump.

                                 WREN
                        I’m sorry.

           Aaron appears behind her, obliviously serene.

                                 AARON
                        That dude’s mom was my scout leader.

           Wren’s phone RINGS. The number is unfamiliar. She picks up.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. BARF’S HOUSE - SAME

           Barf prowls his scary lair, a grungy riot of death metal art, 
           chains and amps stacked to the ceiling. A giant BATTLE AXE 
           dominates one wall. Barf barks into the phone.

                                 BARF
                        Who the hell is this?

                                 WREN
                        What? You called me. Who’s this?

                                 BARF
                        This is Barf. I got Spidey.
           The closet door rattles wildly.

                                 WREN
                        Albert? Oh my God! You’re a lifesaver! 
                        Where are you? Wait, it doesn’t 
                        matter, I don’t have a car. Do you 
                        think maybe you could drop him off?

                                 BARF
                        Maybe you don’t understand. See, 
                        Spidey thought it’d be a good idea 
                        to feed my dog a shit bomb. Know 
                        what that is? It’s a shit with a 
                        bomb in it. Now, Ozzy liked to eat 
                        shit. If he was a man, you might 
                        call it his hobby. So you can 
                        forgive him for not pausing to 
                        realize this particular shit had a 
                        bomb in it. Now he’s dead.

                                 WREN
                        I am so, so sorry. My brother, he 
                        doesn’t have many good role models.

                                 BARF
                        Well they got ‘em down at juvey, 
                        that’s for sure. Ever seen the movie 
                        where Kevin Bacon plays a juvey 
                        guard and makes young Brad Pitt give 
                        him a BJ? It’s good, you should rent 
                        it. Anyway I was about to call your 
                        punk brother a ride down there with 
                        Westbrae’s finest, but thought his 
                        folks might see another way. Yours’s 
                        the only number he’d give, though, 
                        so it’s on you, sister.

                                 WREN
                        What do you want?

                                 BARF
                        Cash. Dumb bastard cost me 200 new. 
                        Plus he pissed all over my original 
                        Sticky Fingers. That’s another hundo, 
                        easy. Call it 400 for my grief.

           He hawks a loogie on the floor.

                                 WREN
                        I don’t have that kind of money. I 
                        get 20 dollars a week.
                                 BARF
                        Then go sell your poon down at the 
                        Arco, I don’t care. 26 Grove Street. 
                        You got an hour.

           He hangs up. Wren stares at her phone in disbelief. Right 
           then it CHIRPS with a new TEXT MESSAGE. Wren’s heart leaps. 
           Maybe Barf had a change of heart? Nope, it’s from her MOM:

           “Heading home. Hope you’re awake — forgot my keys! 8-]”

           Wren looks helplessly around. What now?

           INT. BRUEDER’S BASEMENT REC ROOM - NIGHT

           Phone in hand, Joy returns to find the party in full frat mode 
           — any pretense of sophistication long drowned in a puddle of 
           keg spray. She finds Keevin in an emotional round of quarters.

                                 JOY
                        You ready to get out of here?

                                 KEEVIN
                        Leave? We’re just getting going! 
                        Come on, dance with me.

           He gyrates drunkenly. There is no music.

                                 JOY
                        I have this weird feeling. I need 
                        to go home.

                                 KEEVIN
                        You just need to catch up. Come on!

           He drags her by the wrist to the keg.

                                 JOY
                        No, Keevin. I don’t... no!

           She’s serious, but he’s not listening. He holds up the tap, 
           urging her on. The crowd cheers. Joy seals her lips, shakes 
           her head. But before she knows it, Brueder and the Blues 
           Brother HOIST her ankles over her head. She instinctively 
           grabs the rim of the keg and Keevin jams the tap in her mouth.

                                 KEEVIN
                        One! Two! Three!...

           The beer flows forth in a deluge. Joy has no choice but to 
           chug. The crowd joins in Keevin’s CHANT, cheering her on.

           But then slowly, one at a time... they fall SILENT.
                                 BLUES BROTHER
                        What is that?

           Joy’s skirt, turned upside down, is hiked up around her 
           ribs... exposing a very sturdy-looking GIRDLE.

                                 BRUEDER
                        It’s some kind of mechanical underwear.

           Other guests join the discussion.

                                 GUEST 1
                        I think it’s a back brace.

                                 GUEST 2
                        It’s not on her back, it’s on her 
                        ass. It’s an ass brace.

                                 BLUES BROTHER
                        Why would you need your ass braced?

           Joy squirms, helpless, her ass on full display, her mouth 
           plugged. Keevin is focused on his stopwatch, increasingly 
           thrilled. The whorish nurse from before joins the group.

                                 NURSE
                        It’s a girdle, idiots. My nanna had one.

                                 BLUES BROTHER
                        What’s it do?

                                 NURSE
                        It squashes down your fat, like if 
                        you have a Front Butt.

                                 BRUEDER
                        Is that the same as a Muffin Top?

                                 NURSE
                        No, a Muffin Top is when the fat 
                        oozes out over your belt, like 
                        fatty batter.

           They motion to Joy to illustrate.

                                 BRUEDER
                        I see, whereas a Front Butt is 
                        lower and more, well, butt-like.

                                 BLUES BROTHER
                        What? No, that’s a Baby Joey --
                                 JOY
                        Put me down!

           She spits out the tap in an explosion of foam. The guys 
           quickly lower her to the ground, scolded like children. Joy 
           yanks down her skirt, beet-red. The crowd is silent.

           Only Keevin is oblivious. He jumps up with his hand 
           outstretched for a high-five.

                                 KEEVIN
                        Twenty-nine!

           Joy ignores him, grabs her coat and stomps out.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Wren sits alone in the passenger seat of a car parked in front 
           of an ATM. Her breath fogs. After a moment, someone gets in 
           beside her and hands her a wad of CASH. It’s Mr. Jake. He 
           wears a coat over pajama pants and his hair sticks up.

                                 WREN
                        Thank you so much. I’ll pay you 
                        back, I promise.

           Mr. Jake waves her off, glum.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        It’s just nice to feel useful.

           The elephant in the room. Wren proceeds gently.

                                 WREN
                        I saw you were on the couch.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Yeah, you know, sometimes that big 
                        king bed is way too restful. I need 
                        two or three remotes in my back to 
                        know I’m alive.

           He laughs weakly and Wren returns the favor. They’re silent a 
           while. He stares off through the fogged-up windshield.

                                 MR. JAKE (CONT’D)
                        You ever feel like you’re living 
                        someone else’s life? Like, we’re 
                        all stuck inside a giant dollhouse, 
                        and one day someone just plucked 
                        you out of one room, changed your 
                        shirt and your hat, and put you 
                        back down in another.
                                 WREN
                        I think that was an episode of The 
                        Twilight Zone.

           Mr. Jake smiles. Sadly.

                                 WREN (CONT’D)
                        But yeah. I mean, from what I 
                        remember, the first half of my life 
                        was awesome. I know there were always 
                        Peanut M&M’s. Then it all went to 
                        shit. If this is someone else’s life, 
                        I feel pretty sorry for them.

           Mr. Jake smiles at her, this time warmly. Fatherly.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        You’re golden, Karen DeSantis. You 
                        know that?

                                 WREN
                        I...’m not sure what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Brilliant. Rare. Not like these 
                        other kids. Hell, you’re hardly a 
                        kid anymore. That scrawny freshman, 
                        could hardly turn the potting wheel.

                                 WREN
                             (laughing)
                        I sprained my knee and had to go to 
                        the nurse’s.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        You milked those crutches for six 
                        weeks, till I caught you on your 
                        skateboard.
                             (beat)
                        Now look at you.

           Wren studies her hands.

                                 MR. JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Young woman, going off to school, 
                        whole new life ahead of her.

                                 WREN
                        School, right. That’s not looking 
                        so good.
                                 MR. JAKE
                        It doesn’t matter. Wherever you go, 
                        whatever you do, it’s gonna be 
                        spectacular. Because you’re Wren... 
                        ready to take flight.

           He punctuates this little bon mot with a soaring hand gesture 
           and a stroke of his flavor-saver. Wren looks up, bashful, not 
           accustomed to praise.

                                 WREN
                        Thanks, Mr. Jake.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Please, you’re about to graduate. 
                        Make it Jake.

           He slowly leans in. Wren freezes.

                                 WREN
                        What are you...?

                                 MR. JAKE
                             (nothing but breath)
                        Don’t worry. No one will know.

           He kisses her, his two-day beard pricking her trembling lips. 
           Wren’s knuckles go white around the wad of cash. It’s just a 
           thin, girl’s hand, not a woman’s.

           Until it tightens... into a fist.

           CRUNCH! Wren nails Mr. Jake in the face. His nose EXPLODES in 
           a spray of blood as cash flies everywhere.

                                 MR. JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Agh! You fucking bitch!

                                 WREN
                        Get away from me!

           He stanches the blood with one hand and grabs at her with the 
           other. She jumps out of the car and he falls face down on the 
           seat, so he’s looking up through the open door. He sneers, his 
           words thick with blood and snot.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Oh come on, like you haven’t been 
                        waving it in my face for four 
                        years. Like it’s not the reason you 
                        came to me tonight.
                                 WREN
                        I came because I needed your help!

                                 MR. JAKE
                        And you got it. Now what about me?

           Wren looks down at him, sad, angry. But mostly, disappointed.

                                 WREN
                        I can’t help you.

           She throws the REST OF THE MONEY in his face and runs off. He 
           calls after her into the night.

                                 MR. JAKE
                        Come back here, Wren. Do you hear 
                        me, Miss DeSantis?!

           EXT. EMPTY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           MUSIC: Thin Lizzy’s “Whiskey in the Jar”

           Wren runs and runs, desperate, distraught. The town is asleep. 
           It’s just her out there, all alone.

           INT. THIBODEAUX FAMILY VOLVO - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Roosevelt drives along, morose. He stops at a stop sign. AL 
           GORE’S VOICE rattles the car with a thundering lisp.

                                 AL GORE (FROM STEREO) 
                        ...it may not be convenient, but it 
                        is true...

           In a sudden fit of rage, Roosevelt rears back and KICKS IN 
           the stereo. Bits of metal and plastic fly everywhere, until 
           it finally shuts the hell up. Peace at last.

           Outside, a VOICE reaches his ears. A man and woman are arguing. 
           She’s trying to get into her car and he’s trying to stop her.

           Roosevelt realizes: it’s KEEVIN AND JOY.

           EXT. BARF’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wren arrives on Barf’s rotting patio, panting and distressed. 
           She stops. What now? No clue, but she rings the bell anyway.

           Barf opens the door immediately. He eyes her up and down, 
           saying nothing, then stands aside to let her pass. He checks 
           up and down the street before closing the door.
           INT. BARF’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Wren enters and stops. The room is offensive in its clutter and 
           filth. Half-eaten fast food sits in various states of decay. 
           The couch’s stains have stains. The entire wall beside Wren 
           sags toward her under the weight of thousands of vinyl records.

                                 BARF
                        You got the cash?

                                 WREN
                        Let me see him.

           The closet door rattles. Wren moves toward it, but Barf blocks 
           the way.

                                 BARF
                        You know, Ted Bundy got his start 
                        shoving firecrackers up cats’ butts. 
                        Kinda can’t blame him. Fuckin’ hate 
                        cats, ‘specially the prissy ones 
                        with the flat faces. But dogs... a 
                        kid kills a dog, maybe he deserves 
                        to give Kevin Bacon a BJ.

                                 WREN
                        I am so sorry about your dog. I’m 
                        sure he didn’t mean to hurt him.

           Barf fights back a tear. Or pretends to.

                                 BARF
                        Little guy was just doing his job. 
                        How was he supposed to know the 
                        balls he was getting ready to sick 
                        belonged to a monster?

           He nods to the corner and Wren jumps back. Ozzy is PROPPED UP 
           in a recliner like a human. His tongue hangs out grotesquely.

           Wren takes a deep breath. There’s just no way around it.

                                 WREN
                        I don’t have the money.

           Barf’s demeanor immediately changes.

                                 BARF
                        Then kindly get the fuck out my house.

           He picks up the PHONE, but stops. Did he hear something? Like 
           a sniffing, distant and muffled. Wren knows exactly what it 
           is. It’s the first sound Albert’s made all night.
           He’s crying.

                                 WREN
                        Please. There must be another way.

           Barf leers at her body.

                                 BARF
                        Believe me, if I hadn’t already 
                        popped two Oxys, I’da gladly hit 
                        that cooz in trade.

           Wren blinks — not what she meant. Barf starts DIALING. Wren 
           looks desperately around, wracking her brain. Then the wall of 
           albums catches her eye. And it hits her.

                                 WREN
                        Do you have Vagabonds of the 
                        Western World?

                                 BARF
                        Lizzy? Sister, I was rockin’ Mama 
                        Nature when you was a tadpole in 
                        your daddy’s sack.

                                 WREN
                        Look at the liner notes, top right.

           The police dispatcher picks up.

                                 DISPATCHER (FROM PHONE)

           Barf eyes Wren, suspicious but intrigued.

                                 DISPATCHER (FROM PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Do you have an emergency?

                                 BARF
                        Please hold.

           He puts the phone down without hanging up and goes to his 
           wall of vinyl. He pulls down a weathered old Thin Lizzy album 
           and flips it open. Inside is a picture of Phil Lynott 
           pointing at the camera.

           He’s wearing Wren’s jacket.

           Wren closes her eyes and takes hold of her zipper. For what 
           seems like an eternity, she doesn’t move. Then, with tremendous 
           effort, she slowly unzips the jacket, each link like a dagger to 
           her heart. The jacket sags off her shoulders. She seems naked.
                                 BARF (CONT’D)
                        You don’t expect me to believe...

                                 WREN
                        Look at the pocket.

           She throws him the jacket. Stitched to the inside pocket is a 
           threadbare label from a Dublin surplus shop. Barf compares the 
           jacket to the photo. It’s unmistakable. They’re identical.

           The closet door RATTLES like mad. Barf grins greedily, tucks 
           the jacket under his arm, and puts a meaty paw on Wren.

                                 BARF
                        I appreciate the donation, but some 
                        kids just belong in prison.

           He steers her forcefully toward the door. Wren struggles, but 
           he’s too strong. The closet door goes CRAZY. Wren CRIES OUT for 
           Albert as the closet gets farther and farther away. She failed. 
           She finally found him and she failed.

           Suddenly, just as Barf is shoving Wren through the door, a 
           WINDOW SHATTERS somewhere in the house. TWO MORE follow. And 
           now the house is filling with SMOKE. An alarm SQUEALS.

           We get a CLOSE UP: little spherical SMOKE BOMBS are flying in 
           one after another, spewing forth their noxious fog.

           Right then, someone KICKS IN the back door. Actually, it takes 
           a few kicks, and eventually the use of the handle.

           Through the haze, a FIGURE appears. He wears a short bathrobe 
           and two belts over his shoulders like bandoliers. Strapped to 
           his face is a World War I GAS MASK... BONG. He strides into 
           the house distributing smoke bombs.

                                 FUZZY
                        Yeah, ain’t nothin’ sweeter than 
                        motherfuckin’ payback!

           Chaos, to the tune of Thin Lizzy’s “Jailbreak,” ERUPTS.

           Barf charges blindly into the smoke, releasing Wren. She 
           feels her way to the closet and frees Albert. He hugs her 
           hard around the waist. Through the smoke, we spot Barf’s 
           phone, still OFF THE HOOK. Fuzzy continues on his warpath.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        How you like these tiny balls?
           He scatters another handful of smoke bombs. Wren and Albert 
           stumble toward the door. They’re almost outside when Albert 
           stops. And turns back.

                                 WREN
                        No, Albert!

           From his unique elevation, Albert navigates easily beneath the 
           worst of the smoke. He finds Barf groping blindly along the 
           wall. With sudden, impressive force, Albert rears back a little 
           Spider-fist and DRILLS Barf hard in the crotch. Barf drops to 
           his knees. And drops the JACKET into Albert’s waiting arms.

                                 FUZZY
                        I got you covered, Ray-Ray!

           Fuzzy lays down a string of firecrackers as Albert sprints for 
           the door. Barf is close on his heels, but the deafening CRACKS 
           send him cowering back. Fuzzy leaves the rest of his supply 
           BURNING inside the entryway and shuts the door on his way out.

           EXT. BARF’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           It sounds like a munitions plant going up in flames as Fuzzy, 
           Wren and Albert run from the house. Reaching the gate, they 
           suddenly stop.

           Speeding toward them from either end of the street, sirens 
           wailing, are two POLICE CARS. There’s nowhere to run.

                                 FUZZY
                             (stoic)
                        I got this.

                                 WREN
                        Got what? We’re trapped.

                                 FUZZY
                        Could be. Or it could just be one 
                        last gut check for a man tired of 
                        living his life on mute.

           Inexplicably, and with the steely resolve of a soldier 
           preparing for battle, Fuzzy begins REMOVING HIS CLOTHES. 
           First his robe, then his sweatpants, shoes and socks... then 
           his briefs. Soon, Fuzzy is BUTT NAKED. It isn’t pretty.

                                 FUZZY (CONT’D)
                        They can lock me up, but they can 
                        never re-cage the rage. Owwwwww!

           He darts into the street in front of the squad cars, HOWLING. 
           Both the cops’ faces register utter bewilderment. 
           Whatever they were called for, this is clearly more pressing. 
           They fall in behind the pasty, raving manatee.

           Fuzzy leads them across the neighbor’s lawn and onto a cross 
           street. He’s still howling as they DISAPPEAR UP THE BLOCK.

           SECONDS LATER, Barf barrels out of the house, screaming and 
           wielding the battle axe from his wall.

           He trails off. The street is deserted.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SOME KIND OF PARK - NIGHT

           Wren and Albert squeeze through a tall, wrought iron fence. 
           It’s not exactly clear where they are. They’re both somber.

                                 WREN (V.O.)
                        Things I Would Say to My Dad, If I 
                        Could Just See Him Again.

           She kneels and pulls a handful of daisies out of the ground.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Why didn’t you eat more fucking 
                        oats? Red Vines for breakfast? What 
                        the hell is that? No wonder your 
                        colon disintegrated.

           They cross a wide expanse of grass. Cold wind kicks up leaves.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m thinking of becoming a 
                        stenographer. Regular hours, 
                        recession-proof. You down with that?

           They arrive at their destination and stare solemnly down. Wren 
           bends and places the daisies on top of a granite plaque. Etched 
           in the stone are the words: “PETER DESANTIS, 1961-2001.” Albert 
           places his pumpkin full of candy beside Wren’s flowers.

                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Did you drop Albert? Or blow pot in 
                        his face? Because the kid is wrong. 
                        Did you see him kill that guy’s 
                        dog? Can you see that stuff up 
                        there, or is it all cloud recliners 
                        and harp concerts?

           Wren’s lip trembles. She’s been fighting it all night, but 
           now her guard finally crumbles. Tears spill down her cheeks.
                                 WREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I miss you. I miss you, Dad. No one 
                        gets it, no one knows. I’m all 
                        alone down here, going through the 
                        motions, trying to act like it’s 
                        all OK. But it’s not OK! It’s not!

           Right then, in the still of the night, a VOICE cuts through 
           Wren’s thoughts. It’s high and clear, and it’s been so long 
           since Wren has heard it, she hardly recognizes the voice as 
           Albert’s.

                                 ALBERT
                        Wren?

           Wren stops. She looks down, startled, and wipes at her tears.

                                 WREN
                        Yes, Albert?

           His eyes rise slowly to meet hers. 

                                 ALBERT
                        Thanks.

           A faint smile creeps onto Wren’s lips. She takes Albert’s 
           little Spider-hand in hers and they stand there together a 
           while over their father’s grave.

           DISSOLVE TO LATER:

           Wren and Albert squeeze back through the fence. And stop. 
           A CAR idles at the curb.

           It’s Joy. Alone.

           Without a word, she reaches over and opens the door. There’s 
           no blame in her eyes, just sadness, sympathy, remorse.

           Wren and Albert climb in, Albert in the middle. Joy puts an 
           arm around her two kids, drawing them close as she drives off 
           in silence.

           INT. JOY’S CAR - DRIVING - A LITTLE LATER

           As they near their house, a figure suddenly FLASHES in the 
           headlights. There’s a THUNK and Joy SLAMS on the brakes. The 
           car comes to a violent halt.

           They all hold their breath. Outside, it’s silent.
           EXT. JOY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Joy jumps out to see what happened. A YOUNG MAN is moaning.

                                 YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
                        Ohhh! Ohhh! Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

                                 JOY
                        Oh my God, are you alright?!

           She nearly GAGS at the sight of him. Wren gets out to see.

           The young man is on his back in front of the car, writhing in 
           agony. His ankle is tucked up at an INHUMAN ANGLE behind his 
           head. Wren double-takes. Is that...?

                                 VOICE
                        Wren?

           She turns. The young man’s COMPANION hovers nearby on the curb. 

           It’s Roosevelt, looking guilty.

                                 WREN
                        Wait, you and Peng were... going 
                        to...?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        ...buy you a little more time.

           Wren smiles as it hits her. Down on the ground, Joy tends to 
           Peng, who continues his virtuoso performance.

                                 PENG
                        I can’t feel my asshole. Sweet mother 
                        of Jesus I can’t feel my own asshole!

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           DING-DONG.

           INT. ROOSEVELT’S HOUSE - A FEW WEEKS LATER - DUSK

           Roosevelt opens the front door to find Wren fidgeting 
           uncomfortably in a frilly dress and high-ish heels. Her hair is 
           pinned up and there’s even a hint of mascara around her eyes. 
           Strangest of all is her jacket — which is nowhere to be seen.

           Roosevelt stares at her, perplexed. He wears baggy sweats and 
           thick wool socks with leather soles.

                                 WREN
                        Is that what you’re wearing?
           Roosevelt is puzzled, as if it were an existential question.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I am wearing it.

                                 WREN
                        Hello! Tonight’s the Fall Ball.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Fall Ball? I thought you said you’d 
                        rather floss with my taint hair.

                                 WREN
                        I was just showing off, alright? 
                        For my date.

           Roosevelt stares back blankly. He’s still not getting it.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Your...?

                                 WREN
                        You! Christ! Will you go to the 
                        Fall Ball with me, Roosevelt? 
                        There, now go put on some non-
                        elastic pants.

           Roosevelt snaps to and runs upstairs. Wren follows him inside 
           and finds Barb and Jackie in the living room. They’re seated 12 
           feet apart, at either end of a gigantic LOOM, on which they’ve 
           nearly finished a photo-realistic tapestry of Barack Obama.

           Seeing Wren, Jackie GROWLS like a tiger.

                                 BARB
                        My gosh, Karen, you look like Miss 
                        Marianne Dashwood herself.

                                 WREN
                        Thanks, Mrs. T. Was she a tranny?

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh, Karen, I wanted to speak with you 
                        about the upstairs tub. Your bead 
                        work is beautiful, but I’m afraid the 
                        caulk’s already begun to split.

                                 WREN
                        Sorry about that. I’ll come by 
                        tomorrow with the silicone stuff. 
                                 BARB
                        Great. I’m sure Roosevelt wouldn’t 
                        mind a hand cleaning the koi pond.

           Roosevelt appears beside Wren in a corduroy coat and a blue 
           tie tied too short. He’s adorable.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        We’re already up to a fender and two 
                        taillights. At the current rate, we 
                        should be paid off by September.

                                 BARB
                        Just in time for fall semester at 
                        NYU. I forgot to mention, Wren, I 
                        saw the dean last week at LentilFest 
                        and she’s looking forward to reading 
                        your application personally.

                                 WREN
                        Thanks, Mrs. T, but I’ve actually 
                        been thinking... Reed has a great 
                        writing program, and it’s not so 
                        far from home. Someone’s gotta keep 
                        my brother from killing again.

           Roosevelt perks up. This is welcome news.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Reed College in Portland? That’s 
                        like, driving distance.

           Wren smiles at him. Right then, the DOORBELL rings.

           CUT TO THE ENTRYWAY: Roosevelt opens the door to find Albert 
           standing there in a little coat and tie. He holds a giant CAT 
           the way that kids do, with its legs and arms dangling awkwardly. 
           It’s almost as tall as he is. He hands the cat to Roosevelt.

                                 ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Albert.
                             (for Wren’s benefit)
                        I didn’t realize you were joining.

                                 WREN
                        Is that alright? My mom had a date.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Yeah, whatever. I’m a... family man.
           EXT. ROOSEVELT’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The camera STAYS PUT as Wren and Roosevelt stroll up the 
           street, talking casually. Albert trails behind, opening 
           mailboxes, karate-kicking bushes.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        So who’s the date?

                                 WREN
                        I don’t know, but he had a bald 
                        spot and didn’t grope my mom in the 
                        foyer, so... so far so good.

           They’re quiet a while, already comfortable enough together 
           not to mind the silence.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        We don’t really have to go to the 
                        Fall Ball.

                                 WREN
                        Thank you! When you called my bluff 
                        with the tie I about yacked.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        How about bowling?

                                 WREN
                        I’d prefer to get through the night 
                        without a fungal infection, thanks.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Movie?

                                 WREN
                        Are you fucking kidding me? If you want 
                        to hold hands with someone, call Peng.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        OK, what would you like to do?

                                 WREN
                        We’re all dressed up. How about 
                        mini golf?

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        That makes no sense. And I’m afraid 
                        of windmills.

                                 WREN
                        Come on, I’ll buy you a churro.
                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Sure, OK. But only if the fry oil’s 
                        non-hydrogenated.

                                 WREN
                        What do you say, Albert?
                             (beat)
                        Albert?

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 WREN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I gotta get that kid some kind of 
                        bell.
