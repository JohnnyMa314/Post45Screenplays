           EXT. CAPE COD - NIGHT - AERIAL

           A blinding rain storm on a cold winter night.  We track the 
           headlights of a black limousine barely cutting through the 
           downpour as it races down a curving, treacherous road.  

           We slowly push in on the limousine’s backseat where...

           INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

           ...THEODORE WHITE, rumpled, bald, with round spectacles, 
           scribbles furiously in a reporter’s notebook.  He’s 
           interrupted -- again -- by the driver...

                                 DRIVER
                        I’m sorry sir -- is it up here?

           WHITE looks up and rubs the fogged window with the patched 
           elbow of his tweed jacket.  Peering into the haze...

                                 WHITE
                        Yes! There! The driveway on the 
                        right.

           EXT. CAPE COD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           The limousine turns suddenly off the road and up a long 
           winding drive.  A barely illuminated flag is flying at HALF-
           MAST.  The limousine stops in front of a large, white-frame 
           clapboard house.  

           INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

           WHITE braces himself and steps out into the tempest, racing 
           for cover on the porch...   

           EXT. CAPE COD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           ...and knocks urgently.  PATRICIA LAWFORD, 39, a familiar 
           square jaw. 

                                 PAT
                        You must be Mr. White.  Please come 
                        in.

           As the door closes behind them both, we PULL WIDE for the 
           first time to see the KENNEDY COMPOUND, HYANNIS PORT.  It is 
           DECEMBER 6, 1963.
           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - ENTRANCE HALLWAY

           WHITE follows PAT, the late president’s sister, into a house 
           of mourning.  Only the rhythmic pounding of the rain 
           accompanies their quick march down a darkened servants hall 
           toward the kitchen...

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - KITCHEN

           ...where DAVE POWERS, a close aide to PRESIDENT KENNEDY, and 
           CHUCK SPALDING and FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT JR, personal friends 
           are seated around the table, conferring in soft whispers.  
           All show signs of exhaustion. POWERS rises to greet WHITE.

                                 POWERS
                        Thank you for coming on such short 
                        notice.  

                                 PAT
                        And on such a terrible night.

                                 POWERS
                        We know the circumstance are 
                        unusual, but she trusts you.  She’s 
                        very vulnerable right now. 

                                 SPALDING
                        Obviously.

                                 POWERS
                        And, well, she just insisted it be 
                        tonight. And that it be you.

                                 WHITE
                        Of course.

           Noticing WHITE’S disheveled state...

                                 SPALDING
                        Can we get you a coffee?  A towel?

                                 WHITE
                        I don’t mean to be abrupt, but we 
                        haven’t much time. The magazine 
                        goes to press tonight and I’ve 
                        already blown the usual deadline.

                                 POWERS
                        Yes. I’m terribly sorry.  Let’s get 
                        to it then.

           POWERS gestures down another HALLWAY... 
                                 POWERS (CONT’D)
                        She’s waiting in the living room.
                             (off WHITE’S hesitation)
                        Alone.  She wants to speak with you 
                        alone.

           We follow WHITE as he walks toward the dimly lit LIVING ROOM, 
           making a feeble attempt to mat down his soaked hair and 
           straighten his tie. 

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM

           WHITE’S POV as we come up from behind on the unmistakable 
           silhouette -- jet black bob curled up, regal bearing. She is 
           seated on the couch, staring out the picture windows at the 
           gray swelling seas.  WHITE pauses in the room’s threshold, 
           unsure of how to proceed.  He awkwardly clears his throat, 
           and her repose is broken.

           JACQUELINE KENNEDY rises and turns to greet him.  She is only 
           34 years-old, at the very height of her legendary beauty, and 
           fully composed.  Attired in "black trim slacks, a beige 
           pullover sweater, her eyes wider than pools," she displays no 
           outward signs of the extraordinary ordeal she is yet still 
           enduring.   

                                 JACKIE
                        Mr. White. I can’t tell you how 
                        grateful I am.  That you’d come all 
                        this way.

                                 WHITE
                        Mrs. Kennedy... I - I’m so sorry 
                        for your loss.

                                 JACKIE
                        Thank you.  I’ve been deeply 
                        touched by the outpouring of 
                        sympathy.  At a time like this you 
                        hope -- Well, it helps to know how 
                        much the country loved him.

           JACKIE gestures to the chair across from her.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to sit down?

           WHITE takes a seat as JACKIE settles back onto the sofa. She 
           draws a cigarette from a pack resting beside her. (Throughout 
           the interview, JACKIE will smoke.  It was a habit she kept 
           secret during her term as First Lady, but there's no longer 
           any need for that .)  She takes a drag and leans forward...   
                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Well, What shall I say?  What can I 
                        do for you?  

           WHITE is perplexed but strains to be gentle...

                                 WHITE
                        Mrs. Kennedy, you called me.  I’m 
                        here to record whatever you’d like 
                        to say to the American people.

           JACKIE takes a long drag...

                                 JACKIE
                        Have you read what they’ve been 
                        writing?  Krock and Merriman and 
                        all the rest?  Merriman is such a 
                        bitter man.  It’s been just one 
                        week and they’re already treating 
                        him like an artifact.  Like some 
                        sum of achievements to be weighed 
                        on a scale.  That’s not how I’ll 
                        have him remembered.

                                 WHITE
                        How do you want him remembered?  
                        Perhaps we can talk about that...

           JACKIE stares past WHITE out that window again.  But she 
           doesn’t answer his question.  Instead...

                                 JACKIE
                        There’d been the biggest crowd at  
                        the airport.  Hot, wild -- like 
                        Mexico or Vienna...

           PRELAP... the roaring crescendo of a crowd catching sight 
           of...

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           EXT. DALLAS - LOVE FIELD - DAY

           PRESIDENT JOHN KENNEDY and JACKIE walking off AIR FORCE ONE 
           onto the tarmac at LOVE FIELD.   It is NOVEMBER 22, 1963. She 
           is wearing that pink wool Chanel suit, with navy lapels, and 
           a pillbox hat, an outfit that will soon be notorious but 
           right now, in the morning light, is cheery and elegant, 
           another fashion pronouncement by the most stylish woman in 
           America. 
           GOVERNOR JOHN CONNALLY and his wife NELLIE wait at the bottom 
           of the short staircase, which is flanked by a saluting honor 
           guard. As JACKIE reaches the bottom of the stairs, NELLIE 
           hands her a bouquet of RED ROSES.

           Shouting over the screaming crowd...

                                 JACKIE
                        My! What a welcome!

                                 NELLIE
                        You look extraordinary!

           The GOVERNOR places a conspiratorial arm around the PRESIDENT 
           and holds him for a whispered conference as more aides pour 
           off the plane.  Amidst the chaos, JACKIE turns around to face 
           the CROWD, which erupts in even louder cheers.  JACKIE 
           appears almost embarrassed and responds with a demure smile.

           And suddenly the PRESIDENT is on the move again, leaving 
           JACKIE to trail behind him as he marches toward the waiting 
           limo, working the rope line.  JACKIE never stops grinning as 
           she methodically makes eye contact, all the while... 

                                 JACKIE
                        Thank you.  Thank you so much for 
                        coming...

           CHARLES ROBERTS, a reporter in the crowd, pushes his way 
           forward...

                                 ROBERTS
                        Mrs. Kennedy, how do you like 
                        campaigning?

                                 JACKIE
                        It’s wonderful.

           Just before the car, the PRESIDENT pauses for JACKIE to catch 
           up, and the GOVERNOR, now wearing a 10-gallon hat, opens the 
           door to the limo.

           The PRESIDENT holds out his hand to help JACKIE into the 
           car...

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                             (playful)
                        Thank you, Mr. President.

           POWERS, the PRESIDENT’S aide, rushes up to the car as JACKIE 
           settles into her seat...
                                 POWERS
                        Be sure to look to your left, away 
                        from the President.  Wave to the 
                        people on your side.  If you both 
                        wave to the same voter, it’s a 
                        waste... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DALLAS - PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE - DAY

           The PRESIDENT and JACKIE are seated behind the GOVERNOR and 
           NELLIE as the MOTORCADE races down LEMMON AVENUE toward 
           downtown Dallas.  There are pockets of people along the route 
           standing in front of office buildings and at intersections...

           The GOVERNOR turns around in his seat...

                                 GOVERNOR CONNALLY
                        Mrs. Kennedy, what language don’t 
                        you speak?

           JACKIE laughs humbly...

                                 PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                        I’m really starting to worry... I 
                        said I was the man who accompanied 
                        Jackie Kennedy to Paris.  I’m 
                        beginning to get that same feeling 
                        here in Texas.  She was brilliant 
                        in Houston, wasn’t she?  Just 
                        brilliant...

                                 GOVERNOR CONNALLY
                             (to JACKIE)
                        If I had a Spanish teacher like you 
                        maybe I’d habla espanol too!

           GOVERNOR CONNALLY turns back around to wave at the passing 
           crowds, and JACKIE reaches into her purse for her 
           sunglasses...

           The PRESIDENT gently takes her hand...

                                 PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                        Don’t Jackie.  Leave them off.

                                 JACKIE
                        But this sun --

                                 PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                        Do you hear them?
           The crowds are chanting “JACK-EE! JACK-EE!”

                                 PRESIDENT KENNEDY (CONT’D)
                        They’re standing out here to see 
                        you.

           JACKIE places the sunglasses into her lap.

                                 PRESIDENT KENNEDY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for coming.  I --

           A deafening BANG rings out, shattering the moment.  JACKIE 
           jumps in her seat tightening her grip on the PRESIDENT’S 
           hand.  The GOVERNOR leans back...

                                 GOVERNOR CONNALLY
                        These god-darn motorcycles backfire 
                        all the time... 

           The MOTORCADE turns onto MAIN STREET and here the CROWDS are 
           dense, lining both sides of the street.  In fact, when they 
           see the presidential limo they actually surge off the 
           sidewalk, leaving the POLICE and SECRET SERVICE struggling to 
           push them back from the car... 

           JACKIE waves her white gloved hand, eliciting shrieks of 
           delight, but under her breath to the PRESIDENT...

                                 JACKIE
                        My god Jack... They’re out of 
                        control.

           NELLIE, sensing JACKIE’S tension... 

                                 NELLIE
                        We’re almost there...

           The MOTORCADE is quickly through the melee, turning right 
           onto HOUSTON STREET and then another quick left onto ELM, 
           beneath the shadow of the TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY... 

           Ahead is DEALEY PLAZA and the shady freeway underpass...

                                 NELLIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s just beyond that...

           And, then to the PRESIDENT

                                 NELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. President, you certainly cannot 
                        say that Dallas doesn’t love you... 
           PRELAP the drumming of rain against a window...

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM

           ... as JACKIE has trailed off, silent, while WHITE is writing 
           furiously in his notebook.  She is lost in the horrible 
           memory, but also purposefully waiting for WHITE to capture 
           everything she’s said. And then...

                                 JACKIE
                        I thought it was another backfire.

           WHITE has caught up and now waits expectantly, practically 
           salivating, for her to continue.  This is the first time 
           she’s spoken to anyone about her husband’s murder.  And, she 
           still won’t, yet... 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what I think of 
                        history, Mr. White?

                                 WHITE
                        Of history?

                                 JACKIE
                        I’ve read a great deal.  More than 
                        people think.  And the more I read, 
                        the more I wonder: When something 
                        is written down, does that make it 
                        true?  Is that how a person must be 
                        remembered?

                                 WHITE
                        Well - it’s all we have.

           Ignoring his reply...

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m not going around accepting 
                        plaques Mr. White. I don’t want 
                        medals for Jack and I’m not going 
                        to be the Widow Kennedy, giving 
                        speeches about my family.  

           JACKIE pauses to light another cigarette.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        When this is over I’m going to 
                        crawl into the deepest retirement 
                        there is.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to live here on the Cape 
                        with the Kennedys so Bobby can 
                        teach Johnny.  He’s a little boy 
                        without a father and he’ll need a 
                        man.

           JACKIE seems to realize she’s been rambling.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        You know.. That first night Bob 
                        MacNamara, he said he’d buy back 
                        our old house in Georgetown.  That 
                        was the first thing I thought of 
                        that night...  Where will I go?

           PRELAP jet engines as we... 

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - PRESIDENTIAL QUARTERS

           ...a TIGHT CLOSE-UP of JACKIE.  Her wide-set, deep brown eyes 
           are blank, exhausted.  As we PULL BACK we see her mascara is 
           streaked, and her cheeks are scarred with red-brown smudges.  
           The dried blood of her dead husband.  She just stares at 
           herself in the mirror.  Perhaps most jarring... the pillbox 
           hat is gone -- cast on the floor -- and her usually perfect 
           hair is tousled.  We have never seen her this dazed.  This 
           vulnerable.   

           JACKIE bows over the sink and splashes her face with bracing, 
           ice-cold water.  As she scrubs at the dry blood with Kleenex, 
           we see the rest of the sparsely furnished cabin...

           Behind JACKIE there is only a BED, made with military 
           precision, bearing pillows with the PRESIDENTIAL SEAL, and a 
           new BLACK DRESS which has been laid out for her to change 
           into.

           In this small, empty room JACKIE pats her face dry with a 
           hanging towel.  Then, seeming to notice her hair, she wets a 
           comb and begins to flatten out the strays.  Her hand quivers 
           and as she struggles, she grows frustrated, until she lets 
           out a wrenching SOB...  

           Interrupted by a KNOCK...

                                 O’BRIEN (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Kennedy?  Are you alright?  
                        It’s Larry...

           JACKIE instantly regains her composure.
                                 JACKIE
                        I’ll be ready in a moment. You can 
                        come in if you like.

           LARRY O’BRIEN, the PRESIDENT’S Congressional Liaison and old 
           family friend, enters the room, closing the door behind him.  
           JACKIE is still combing her hair in the mirror.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        Why did I wash the blood off?

           O’BRIEN stands in stunned silence.  As JACKIE turns to face 
           him, we take in more of the horror.  The pink wool of her 
           dress is streaked black and her stockings are nearly 
           saturated with blood and brain matter.       

                                 O’BRIEN
                        My god.

           JACKIE is almost in a trance. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Are they waiting?

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Take all the time you need.

           JACKIE turns back to the mirror.  She picks up her hat off 
           the floor and places it back on her head, trying to restore 
           the picture from Love Field that morning.  But it is only a 
           macabre distortion. She tosses the hat aside.

           O’BRIEN notices the dress laid out...

                                 O’BRIEN (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Kennedy, would you like me to 
                        step outside so you can change?

           JACKIE ignores him and moves toward the door.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m ready.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           JACKIE emerges, O’BRIEN trailing.  The assembled crowd all 
           turns at once.  The cabin is cramped, crowded.  
           PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON, his wife LADY BIRD, his aide JACK 
           VALENTI, and CONGRESSMEN ALBERT THOMAS and JACK BROOKS, stand 
           with JUDGE SARAH HUGHES, who is waiting with a small bible in 
           her hand.

           PRESIDENT JOHNSON steps toward JACKIE.  His deep Texas drawl 
           is uncharacteristically soft, subdued...

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Mrs. Kennedy.  Are you sure you’re 
                        up for this?

                                 JACKIE
                             (to the group)
                        Please, let’s proceed.

           With that, PRESIDENT JOHNSON stands before JUDGE HUGHES and 
           places his hand on the bible.  JACKIE stands directly to his 
           left and purposefully holds herself erect.

                                 JUDGE HUGHES
                        Do you, Lyndon Baines Johnson, 
                        solemnly swear?

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        I, Lyndon Baines Johnson, do 
                        solemnly swear...

           But JACKIE’S eyes drift downward, blank....

                                 JUDGE HUGHES
                        That you will faithfully execute 
                        the office of -- 

           A FLASHBULB erupts capturing the moment as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - REAR PASSENGER CABIN

           ...JACKIE, staring out the window of AIR FORCE ONE at the 
           country below.  She is seated in the back of the plane, where 
           just beside her, several rows of seats have been torn out to 
           make room for the BRONZE CASKET that holds the PRESIDENT’S 
           body.  JACKIE’S hand rests atop it.

           The few other remaining seats are occupied by the KENNEDY’S 
           closest confidantes and oldest friends -- KENNY O’DONNELL, 
           O’BRIEN, and POWERS.  

           POWERS simply holds his head in his hands.  O’DONNELL and 
           O’BRIEN, whisper, in between sips of whiskey...
                                 O’BRIEN
                        If the Soviets are making a move, 
                        now’s the time to do it.  Rusk and 
                        half the cabinet are on their way 
                        to Tokyo.

                                 O’DONNELL
                        It could be retaliation.  For Diem.  
                        Or Castro.

           JACKIE has been listening.

                                 JACKIE
                        Have they caught anyone?

                                 O’DONNELL
                        In Dallas?

                                 JACKIE
                        The men responsible.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        We don’t know.  We don’t know 
                        anything for sure.  

           POWERS, steering the conversation away from such matters...

                                 POWERS
                        Mrs. Kennedy, are you sure we can’t 
                        get you anything? A drink? 

           A beat.

                                 JACKIE
                        You boys were like brothers to him.  
                        You know that.  His Irish Mafia.

                                 O’DONNELL
                        Thank you for saying that.  
                             (raw)
                        He was our hero.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I’m just glad he saw Boston one 
                        last time.

           They chuckle.

                                 POWERS
                        You know... He almost seemed to 
                        know it.  That he wouldn’t be going 
                        back.
                                 JACKIE
                        How’s that Dave?

                                 POWERS
                        That morning at Hyannis Port.  The 
                        old man had come out to the porch 
                        to say goodbye.  The President -- 
                        Jack -- put his arm around him, 
                        kissed him goodbye.  He started to 
                        walk away, and then went back 
                        again.  Kissed him a second time.

           They take in the story.  It triggers another reminiscence...

                                 O’DONNELL
                        He was so sad in Brookline, the day 
                        before.  At Patrick’s grave.

                                 JACKIE
                        Well, now they’ll be together.

           There’s a KNOCK at the door.  

                                 HILL (O.S.)
                        It’s Clint.  And Admiral Burkley.

                                 JACKIE
                        Come in.

           CLINT HILL, the head of JACKIE’S Secret Service detail, along 
           with ADMIRAL GEORGE BURKLEY, the PRESIDENTS’S personal 
           physician, enter. 

                                 HILL
                        Mrs. Kennedy, we’re an hour out of 
                        Washington.  I’m afraid we need to 
                        deal with some business matters.  

                                 JACKIE
                        Go ahead then.

                                 HILL
                        Given the continued threat, we’ll 
                        be exiting out the rear of the 
                        plane.  You, the President -- 
                        President Johnson that is, Mrs. 
                        Johnson --

                                 JACKIE
                        Absolutely not.

                                 HILL
                        I’m sorry?
                                 JACKIE
                        I will not sneak out the back door.  

                                 HILL
                        But--

                                 JACKIE
                        We’ll go out the usual way.  

                                 POWERS
                        Clint, just see what you can do.

           HILL takes the measure of JACKIE and realizes it’s a lost 
           cause.

                                 HILL
                        Ok.

                                 BURKLEY
                        When we land, Mrs. Kennedy, we’ll 
                        need to proceed directly to the 
                        hospital for the autopsy.

                                 JACKIE
                             (aghast)
                        The autopsy?

           She looks to POWERS again.

                                 POWERS
                        Admiral, is that necessary tonight?

                                 BURKLEY
                        I’m afraid it’s required.

                                 JACKIE
                        Required by who?

                                 BURKLEY
                        By the law, Mrs. Kennedy.

           JACKIE considers this.

                                 BURKLEY (CONT’D)
                        We can do it at any hospital you 
                        like.  The Army Hospital at Walter 
                        Reed, Bethesda --

                                 JACKIE
                        Yes. Bethesda. Jack was a Navy man 
                        and we should do it there.

           The matter is settled.
                                 POWERS
                        Is that all?

                                 HILL

                        Yes.  Thank you, Mrs. Kennedy. 

           JACKIE does not reply, and HILL and BURKLEY exit.  Once the 
           door closes behind them...

                                 JACKIE
                        We must have the Irish Cadets.

                                 POWERS
                        I’m sorry?

                                 JACKIE
                        The Irish Cadets.  Jack loved them.  
                        He saw them perform in Dublin last 
                        summer.  That trip was the happiest 
                        of his life.

           POWERS nods to O’DONNELL and O’BRIEN and the latter takes out 
           a note pad to record the request.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Of course, Mrs. Kennedy.  We’ll 
                        make sure of it.

                                 JACKIE
                        And, those bagpipers from Scotland.  
                        Do you remember Kenny?

                                 O’DONNELL
                        Yeah.  The Black Watch.

                                 JACKIE
                        That’s right.  The Black Watch 
                        Pipers.

           O’BRIEN looks to POWERS, who again nods his ascent, and 
           O’BRIEN writes it down.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I’ve got it, Mrs. Kennedy. 

           JACKIE is another place.

                                 JACKIE
                        He was so happy there.  

           And, then, another KNOCK.
                                 LADY BIRD (O.S.)
                        Honey... It’s just me.  Lady Bird.

           The IRISH MAFIA exchange glances.  JACKIE ignores it.

                                 JACKIE
                        Of course, Mrs. Johnson.  Come 
                        in...

           LADY BIRD JOHNSON enters.  Nearly 20 years JACKIE’S senior, 
           she is a warm, maternal presence.

           LADY BIRD moves toward JACKIE as if she might give her a hug, 
           but stops short, awkwardly, when she notices the gore that 
           still clings to JACKIE’S dress.

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Oh, Darling.

           She takes JACKIE’S hand, instead.

                                 LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
                        The whole country mourns your 
                        husband.

           JACKIE nods.  LADY BIRD turns to the others.

                                 LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry for your loss, 
                        gentlemen.

                                 POWERS
                        Thank you Mrs. Johnson.

           LADY BIRD now turns back to JACKIE.  Gently...

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Darling, can I send someone back to 
                        help you change?  Before we land?

           JACKIE glances down at her dress and seems to take in the 
           horror again, for the first time.

                                 JACKIE
                        No.  I want them to see what 
                        they’ve done.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT

           AIR FORCE ONE taxis to a waiting crowd of television news 
           crews, members of Congress, military escorts, Secret Service -
           - many of whom are openly carrying rifles -- and White House 
           officials, including ATTORNEY GENERAL BOBBY KENNEDY.  It is 
           just after 6pm.

           The plane comes to a halt, and two GROUND CREW MEN drag a 
           moving staircase to the front door.

           As soon as it’s in place, BOBBY bolts from the crowd and up 
           the stairs.

           As BOBBY disappears inside the plane, a FORKLIFT is driven to 
           the rear of the plane as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - REAR PASSENGER CABIN

           ...JACKIE standing with POWERS, O’BRIEN, and O’DONNELL as AIR 
           FORCE ONE CREWMEN open the door behind them...

           From the front of the plane they hear, muffled...

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        Where’s Jackie?

           A beat, and then BOBBY comes through the door toward JACKIE.

                                 JACKIE
                        Bobby!

           JACKIE collapses into his arms.  BOBBY’S face is streaked 
           with tears and JACKIE buries herself into his shoulder.  
           Amidst the noisy chaos of the now-crowded cabin, they are 
           quiet.

           The rear door now swings open, letting in a gust of cold 
           November air.  The FORKLIFT is positioned directly outside, 
           and several CREW MEN now step onto the plane and take hold of 
           the CASKET. 

           BOBBY, his arm still around JACKIE, takes command...

                                 BOBBY
                        Now, where are we going?

           An AIR FORCE OFFICER, in charge of the CREW, answers...
                                 AF OFFICER
                        Sir, there’s a car waiting on the 
                        tarmac to take you and Mrs. Kennedy 
                        to Bethesda.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m not leaving Jack.

                                 AF OFFICER
                             (to BOBBY)
                        There’s an ambulance for the 
                        casket...

                                 JACKIE
                             (pleading)
                        Bobby--

                                 BOBBY
                             (to AF OFFICER)
                        Mrs. Kennedy and I will ride with 
                        the casket.  In the ambulance.
                             (to JACKIE)
                        It’s okay.

           POWERS pulls BOBBY aside, but still in earshot of JACKIE.

                                 POWERS
                        Valenti wants to know how we want 
                        to handle the exit.   

                                 BOBBY
                        The exit?

                                 POWERS
                        Is Lyndon going to escort the 
                        casket?

           JACKIE takes BOBBY’S arm... 

                                 JACKIE
                        Can we go now?  I’d like to get off 
                        this plane.

                                 BOBBY
                             (to POWERS)
                        We’re leaving.  He can exit however 
                        he wants.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

           JACKIE and BOBBY stand on the raised FORKLIFT platform behind 
           the CASKET, which is flanked by KENNEDY AIDES.  

           It is an eerie, static portrait as they stand still and 
           silent, the platform slowly lowering to the ground. JET 
           ENGINES and a HELICOPTER landing nearby provide the deafening 
           backdrop.

           Then, the platform is at ground level and the CASKET is 
           handed off to the waiting HONOR GUARD.  

           As the CASKET is slid off the back of the AMBULANCE, BOBBY 
           hops off the platorm, leaving JACKIE alone. 

           JACKIE’S POV as she stares out at the assembled crowd, now 
           getting their first real look at her battered state.  

           A loud MURMUR and some GASPS as they stare, stunned -- some 
           beginning to weep.

           Then BOBBY reaches up...

                                 BOBBY
                        C’mon Jackie --

           And she hops down into a melee, which sweeps her into the 
           car... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMBULANCE 

           JACKIE and BOBBY sit on either side of the CASKET.  A moment 
           of calm after the frenzy at ANDREWS.

           BOBBY turns to her...

                                 BOBBY
                        They think they’ve caught him.

                                 JACKIE
                        The man who shot Jack?

                                 BOBBY
                        His name’s Oswald. He may have 
                        spent time in the Soviet Union.

                                 JACKIE
                        So, the Russians are behind it?
                                 BOBBY
                        It’s too soon to tell.

                                 JACKIE
                        It was horrible.  The blood.  The 
                        blood was everywhere.

           BOBBY reaches across the CASKET to comfort her.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        I tried to hold his head together.  
                        His head!

                                 BOBBY
                        Stop.  Don’t think about it 
                        Jackie...

           We pull back to see the long MOTORCADE winding it’s way along 
           I-495 as we hear PRESIDENT JOHNSON’S brief remarks from 
           ANDREWS to the nation... 

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON (V.O.)
                        This is a sad time for all people.  
                        We have suffered a loss that cannot 
                        be weighed.  For me, it is a deep 
                        personal tragedy.  I know the world 
                        shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy 
                        and her family will bear.  I will 
                        do my best.  That is all I can do.  
                        I ask for your help -- and God’s.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

           JACKIE’S POV as she enters, accompanied by BOBBY, to find... 
           BENJAMIN and TONI BRADLEE, close friends.  JANET LEE and HUGH 
           AUCHINCLOSS, JACKIE’S mother and step-father.  PAM TURNURE, 
           JACKIE’S press secretary, NANCY TUCKERMAN, her social 
           secretary, MARY GALLAGHER, her private secretary, and DOCTOR 
           JOHN WALSH, her personal doctor.  O’BRIEN and O’DONNELL are 
           also present, along with DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT MACNAMARA.

           JANET steps forward first to embrace her daughter.  

                                 JANET 
                        Oh darling...

                                 JACKIE
                        Mother...

           BOBBY addresses the room...
                                 BOBBY
                        Thank you all for being here.  We 
                        don’t know how long we’ll need to 
                        stay but Jackie and I appreciate 
                        it.

           There is a table with coffee and sandwiches.  JANET ushers 
           her daughter to a seat...

                                 JANET  
                        Come, have something to eat...

           The room divides into smaller groups as PAM, NANCY, MARY, and 
           TONI join JACKIE and her mother.  DR. WALSH, BEN BRADLEE, 
           O’BRIEN, and MACNAMARA break off.  BOBBY confers with 
           O’DONNELL.

           As she sits, JACKIE notices...

                                 JACKIE
                        Where are the children?

                                 JANET
                        They’re with Maud.  She’s taken 
                        them to the house in Georgetown.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’d rather them home.  Their 
                        routine shouldn’t be disrupted more 
                        than necessary.

                                 MARY
                        I’ll see to it.

                                 JACKIE
                        What do they know?

                                 JANET
                        Caroline suspects something, but 
                        they haven’t been told.

                                 JACKIE
                        I should tell them.  Or Maud.  I 
                        mean we can’t just lie to them.

                                 MARY
                        Don’t worry, we’ll--

           DR. WALSH approaches.  JACKIE begins to rise to greet him...

                                 JACKIE
                        Dr. Walsh -- thank you so much for 
                        being here.
                                 DR. WALSH
                        Please.  Sit.  

           Handing her something...

                                 DR. WALSH (CONT’D)
                        For your nerves.  You’ve been 
                        through an unimaginable ordeal.

           JACKIE accepts the pill and delicately swallows it as she 
           sinks back into her seat.

                                 TONI
                        How are you?  We’re all so, so
                        sorry. 

                                 JACKIE
                        I just - I just can’t believe it 
                        actually happened.

                                 JANET
                        This Oswald -- is that his name?

                                 PAM
                        Yes.  “Lee Harvey Oswald” is what 
                        everyone was calling him back at 
                        the office. 

                                 JANET
                        He says he’s some kind of 
                        Communist!

                                 JACKIE
                        A Communist...
                             (beat)
                        It’s just all so absurd.  If he’d 
                        been killed for civil rights... At 
                        least then it would have meant
                        something.  

           No one knows what to say. 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        It was all going so well.  Houston.  
                        Fort Worth.  All the problems Adlai
                        had -- Jack won them all over.  
                             (beat)
                        They kept handing me these yellow 
                        roses.  At every stop.

           JACKIE trails off...
                                 NANCY
                        The Yellow Rose of Texas.

                                 PAM
                        Like the song?

           But JACKIE is lost in her own reverie...

                                 JACKIE
                        Then, in Dallas, they handed me red 
                        roses.  And, I thought, how funny -- 
                        why red roses now?
                             (beat)
                        Then, after... the seat...  It was 
                        just covered in blood and red 
                        roses.

           JANET places an arm around her daughter to comfort her.

           BOBBY and O’DONNELL confer quietly in a small kitchen 
           vestibule off the main room...

                        The sonofabitch wasted no time 
                        taking the plane.  And the oath.  
                        Told me you said it had to be done 
                        immediately.

                                 BOBBY
                        I said no such thing.  Told him he 
                        could do whatever he wanted.  That 
                        he could have one of his Texas 
                        judges do it if he wanted.

                                 O’DONNELL
                        Well we’re done now.  We’ll just 
                        pack up and go back to Boston.    

                                 BOBBY
                        Kenny, we need to watch out for 
                        Jackie and the kids.  She’ll stay 
                        in that house as long as she needs 
                        to.  You understand?

           JACKIE continues to hold court, occasionally glancing at the 
           television where CRONKITE reports on the days events.  

           BOBBY, O’BRIEN, and O’DONNELL approach.

                                 BOBBY
                        Jackie, I’m going to go downstairs 
                        to check on Jack.

                                 JACKIE
                        Yes, thank you Bobby.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Mrs. Kennedy?  Kenny and I are 
                        going back to the White House.  The 
                        press... They’re already asking... 
                        about the funeral.

                                 JACKIE
                        Of course.  What can I do?  

           O’BRIEN is not sure how to respond.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Nothing.  Just be with your family.

                        We’ll call you when we need you.

           She reflects, while O’BRIEN and O’DONNELL begin to exit... 

                                 O’BRIEN/O’DONNELL
                        Goodnight. See you back at the 
                        house...  

           Then...

                                 JACKIE
                        I keep thinking of those picture 
                        books.  Of Lincoln.  

           O’BRIEN and O’DONNELL stop, confused.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Abraham Lincoln’s funeral.  Bill 
                        Walton showed me photos and 
                        drawings.  When we were renovating 
                        the house.  Have Mr. West call 
                        Bill.  It’s in the books.  The 
                        decorations.  The procession.  
                                 O’BRIEN
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 JANET
                        Oh Jackie -- don’t worry about all 
                        that.  These people here will 
                        handle --

           JACKIE ignores her mother and now stands up, walking toward 
           O’BRIEN, until she’s holding onto his elbow, as if for 
           support...

                                 JACKIE
                             (to O’BRIEN)
                        This must be exactly as Jack would 
                        have wanted it.  We owe him that.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Of course, Mrs. Kennedy.

                                 JACKIE
                        And tell them I’ll walk behind the 
                        casket. The black bunting, the 
                        catafalque, the horse and carriage.  
                        Jack deserves those things, don’t 
                        you think?

           SECRETARIES and ASSISTANTS also watching KRONKITE and 
           awaiting word on their fallen leader. 

           WEST’S phone rings.  His secretary JANICE HILL, answers.

                             (to WEST)
                        Mr. West, it’s Bethesda.
           WEST picks up immediately and the whole room quiets down.

                        Right away.

           WEST hangs up.

                             (to HILL)
                        Get Bill Walton on the phone.  And 
                        have someone drive to the Library 
                        of Congress and begin pulling 
                        everything they have on Abraham 
                        Lincoln’s funeral.

           Some raised eyebrows from the assembled group.

                                 HILL
                        Yes, sir. 

           One of the ASSISTANTS speaks up...

                                 ASSISTANT
                        This coming from the Attorney

                                 WEST
                        No.  From the First Lady herself.

                        It will be closed won’t it?  At the

                                 BOBBY
                        We can sort that all out later.

                        I want it closed so badly.

                        I’m just not sure it can be.  For a 
                        Head of State... everyone will want 
                        to see him.

                        But, it’s so morbid.  

           BOBBY feels he must take control...

                                 BOBBY
                        Jackie, no one understands better 
                        than I do what you’re going 
                        through.  We all want what’s right 
                        for Jack.  But this is a 
                        President’s funeral.  We have to 
                        consider what the public will want.  
                        We just have to...

           JACKIE takes this in but doesn’t directly reply.
                                 JACKIE
                        Let’s go then.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM 

           An army of aides, family, and friends, are working to 
           transform the EAST ROOM into an appropriate setting for the 
           PRESIDENT to lie in repose.  WEST, SARGENT SHRIVER, DICK 
           GOODWIN, presidential speech-writer, and a dozen young 
           secretaries toil under the direction of BILL WALTON, painter, 
           author, and JACKIE’S arbiter of taste.  This is the man who 
           led her famous renovation of the White House.

           The room is a large ballroom, with five enormous windows, 
           white enameled walls, and three decorative chandeliers.  
           WALTON’s crew is hanging BLACK CURTAINS over all the windows, 
           looping BLACK CREPE along the molding, and erecting a 
           catafalque from pieces out of a crate.

           WALTON assesses the frantic progress with SHRIVER.  WEST 
           presents him with several ORNATE CANDLESTICKS..

                                 WALTON
                        No. Absolutely not.
                             (to SHRIVER)
                        They’re just hideous, aren’t they?

                                 SHRIVER
                        They’re pretty bad.

           WEST now lifts up a CRUCIFIX, with a silver Jesus figurine 
           affixed to a gold cross.

                        Doesn’t anyone have something that 
                        would fit?

                        get mine from home. 

                                 WALTON
                        How about the arrival?
                                 SHRIVER
                        There’s nobody to meet them.  We 
                        need soldiers or sailors.  Some 
                        kind of escort.

                        post. 

                                 WALTON
                        Well someone wake them up!

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - MOTORCADE

           The MOTORCADE carrying the PRESIDENT’S CASKET winding past 
           the glowing monuments of the Capitol, passing rows of 
           AMERICAN FLAGS outside government offices, all flying at half-
           mast.  It pulls up to the NORTHWEST GATE of the WHITE 
           HOUSE...

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTHWEST PORTICO 

           ...and comes to a stop.  A MARINE HONOR GUARD has taken up 
           position and SHRIVER waits outside.  JACKIE and BOBBY step 
           out of the AMBULANCE. As the MARINES move to unload the 
           coffin, SHRIVER takes JACKIE by the hand and leads her 
           inside...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM 

           ...where WEST, WALTON, PAM, NANCY, MARY, MACNAMARA, and the 
           all the volunteers wait silently.  The room is complete, 
           transformed into a somber chamber of mourning.  They stand 
           more erect and the last murmurs die out as JACKIE enters.

           JACKIE steps inside the doorway, and then aside, as the 
           MARINES carry the casket to the catafalque.  

           A priest, FATHER JOHN KUHN, steps forward and begins a brief 
           mass.

                                 FATHER KUHN
                        Out of the depths I cry to you, O
                        LORD...O Lord, hear my voice.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FATHER KUHN (CONT'D)
                        Let your ears be attentive to my 
                        cry for mercy...

           As KUHN continues his prayer O.S... 

           JACKIE approaches the coffin, kneels, and buries her head on 
           the flag...

                                 FATHER KUHN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        If you, O LORD, kept a record of 
                        sins, O Lord, who could stand? But 
                        with you there is forgiveness; 
                        therefore you are feared.

           JACKIE walks past the gathered staff, making eye contact with 
           each...

                                 FATHER KUHN (CONT’D)
                        I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, 
                        and in his word I put my hope.
                        My soul waits for the Lord more 
                        than watchmen wait for the morning, 
                        more than watchmen wait for the 
                        morning.

           JACKIE exits the EAST ROOM, and we...

           ...JACKIE, alone, surveying her dark bedroom.  Her WEDDING 
           PHOTO sits on one night-stand, PHOTOS OF JOHN JR and CAROLINE 
           on the other.  She begins to finally unbutton the Chanel
           suit...

                                 FATHER KUHN (O.S.)
                        O Israel, put your hope in the 
                        LORD, for with the LORD is 
                        unfailing love... 

           ...and as we PAN DOWN...

                                 FATHER KUHN (CONT'D)
                        And with him is full redemption. He 
                        himself will redeem Israel from all 
                        their sins.

                ...let’s it fall to the floor in a bloody heap.
                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM 

           The black curtains have been pulled back, and the rising 
           sunlight streams into the room, glistening off the bronze 
           handles of the PRESIDENT’S CASKET.  It is quiet and still.  
           The day after.

           WALTON stands in the center of the room, surveying his rushed 
           handiwork from the night before.  He meticulously adjusts a 
           fresh vase of flowers that has been placed at the base of the 
           catafalque.   

           His concentration is interrupted by...

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Mr. Walton?

           NANCY stands in the doorway.  (She may be JACKIE’S social 
           secretary now, but they’ve been close friends since 
           childhood.  In many ways, NANCY is JACKIE’S less stylish, 
           less attractive sister.)  She’s changed into fresh clothes -- 
           a formal black skirt suit -- and her hair is spayed into the 
           formal style of the previous decade.  

           WALTON finishes adjusting the flowers, not bothering to turn 
           around.

                                 WALTON
                        Yes?

                                 NANCY
                        The First Lady is awake and I 
                        expect she’ll be down momentarily.  
                        She would like to see the 
                        arrangements before the guests 
                        arrive for this morning’s mass.

           WALTON turns to face her.

                                 WALTON
                        How is she?

                                 NANCY
                        We’ve not spoken yet this morning.  
                        I was on my way to see her.
                                 WALTON
                        Well, we’re ready in here.  And the 
                        chairs have been set up for the 
                        service itself in the family dining 
                        room.

                                 NANCY
                        Did you get any sleep?

                                 WALTON
                        Not yet.  I’ve been pouring over 
                        these Lincoln photos all night.
                             (beat)
                        Does she really intend to walk?  In 
                        an outdoor procession?

                                 NANCY
                        It’s what she said last night. But 
                        I hardly think she can be held to 
                        anything she said, under the 
                        circumstances.

                                 WALTON
                        They’ll never let her, you know.

                                 NANCY
                        Let her?

                                 WALTON
                        The world’s gone mad.  She should 
                        take the children and disappear.  
                        Build a fortress in Boston and 
                        never look back.

           He is exhausted.

                                 WALTON (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  I guess I should lie 
                        down for a bit.

                                 NANCY
                        Well, thank you Mr. Walton.  I’ll 
                        let her know everything is in order 
                        for the mass.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - JACKIE’S BEDROOM

           A pair of BARE LEGS swing over the side of the bed.  We PAN 
           UP to see JACKIE wearing a long silk nightgown, in the now-
           bright bedroom.  Still sitting, JACKIE glances at the floor, 
           where last night she dropped her bloody dress.  It’s gone.
           The next thing we notice is that this is clearly JACKIE’S 
           bedroom.  And her’s alone.  There are no signs of a man’s 
           influence on the decor.

           She steels herself, and stands up, launching us into a 
           sequence of ordinary domestic tasks.  The only sound we hear 
           is from doors creaking, faucets turning, and water gushing 
           as... 

           JACKIE steps into the shower and the frosted glass door shuts 
           behind her...

           JACKIE turns on the water... 

           CLOSEUP on JACKIE as water pounds her face...

           JACKIE leans over the sink, brushing her teeth.  JACKIE 
           spits.

           JACKIE’S POV as she steps into her perfectly organized 
           closet.  She scans row after row of vibrant colors -- pinks, 
           reds, greens, yellows, blues, violets -- and lands on a tiny 
           section of black, in the back corner.  She moves toward it as 
           we...

           CAROLINE KENNEDY, 5 years old, stands in the center of her 
           bedroom.  MAUD SHAW, her longtime nanny, kneels before her, 
           putting the finishing touches on the little girl’s somber 
           grey dress.

           skin will pop dramatically against the backdrop of her black

                        Oh, Nancy.  I’m so glad it’s you.

                        They’re both so little.  What can I 
                        tell them?

           NANCY takes JACKIE’S arm to comfort her.

                                 NANCY
                        Oh dear. It won’t matter what you 
                        say.  Just hug them and tell them 
                        it will be okay.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CAROLINE KENNEDY’S BEDROOM

           CAROLINE and JOHN JR. are playing on the floor, while MAUD 
           watches from the bed.  

           There’s a KNOCK at the door and MAUD jumps up to get it.  
           It’s NANCY and JACKIE.  

           While JACKIE enters the room to the delighted squeals of her 
           children...
           In hushed tones...

                                 NANCY
                        What do they know?

                                 MAUD
                        I tried to explain to Caroline last 
                        night.  She keeps asking for them.  
                        But she doesn’t understand. 

           JACKIE hugs and kisses CAROLINE and JOHN JR, leading them to 
           the bedside so she can sit at eye-level with them.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Mommy... Why are you dressed so 
                        funny?

                                 JACKIE
                        Something very sad has happened.  
                        And this is how we dress when 
                        something sad happens.

                                 JOHN JR.
                        Where’s Daddy?

                                 JACKIE
                        Daddy won’t be coming home.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Why not?

           JACKIE struggles.  She looks up to NANCY and MAUD who can 
           only offer empathetic glances.

                                 JACKIE
                        Daddy went to see your baby brother 
                        Patrick.  In heaven.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Why?

                                 JACKIE
                        Because I’m here with you.  And 
                        Daddy didn’t want Patrick to be 
                        lonely.

                                 CAROLINE
                        But what about us?

                                 JOHN JR.
                        Mommy - I want Daddy.

           JOHN JR, confused, runs back to his toys and resumes playing.  
           MAUD immediately goes to be with him.
                                 CAROLINE
                        What about us mommy?

           JACKIE pulls CAROLINE closer.

                                 JACKIE
                        Caroline, Mommy needs you to be a 
                        big girl.
                             (beat)
                        A very bad man hurt Daddy.  Daddy 
                        would come home if he could.  But 
                        he can’t.  He has to go to heaven.

           Some understanding is beginning to build.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Can I say goodbye?

                                 JACKIE
                        Yes, my love.  You can say goodbye.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           NANCY waits outside CAROLINE’S ROOM.  JACKIE emerges and 
           closes the door behind her.  

           JACKIE takes a deep sigh.

                                 NANCY
                        You did great.

           But JACKIE is on auto-pilot.

                                 JACKIE
                        What’s next?

                                 NANCY
                        The family mass starts in 20 
                        minutes in the Dining Room.

                                 JACKIE
                        The Dining Room?

                                 NANCY
                        It seemed like the best space.

                                 JACKIE
                        Let’s hold it in the East Room.  
                        With the casket.
                                 NANCY
                        But --

                                 JACKIE
                        They have 20 minutes.  Isn’t that 
                        plenty of time to move the chairs?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM 

           The same scene as the night before, but chairs are being 
           hastily relocated and arranged around the catafalque for the 
           30 family members who have assembled for the MASS.

           Present are once again JACKIE’S parents, JANET LEE and HUGH 
           AUCHINCLOSS, and her half-brother JAMES AUCHINCLOSS. But the 
           KENNEDY CLAN is now also here in full.  BOBBY and ETHEL, 
           TEDDY and JOAN, PAT and her husband PETER, and their mother 
           ROSE.  Behind the family are close aides O’BRIEN, O’DONNELL, 
           and POWERS, along with their wives.  

           They are all milling about the room, waiting for the service 
           to start.

           BOBBY is consoling ROSE, when O’BRIEN catches his eye and 
           gestures for his attention.

                                 BOBBY
                        Excuse me mother...

           BOBBY and O’BRIEN huddle away from the other guests.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah?

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Lyndon’s boys are already measuring 
                        the drapes in the Oval.

                                 BOBBY
                        No surprise there.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I got a call this morning from 
                        Valenti.  Wants to meet this 
                        afternoon to go over the funeral.

                                 BOBBY
                        The funeral?  Tell him to show up, 
                        keep quiet, and sit in the back.
                                 O’BRIEN
                        They’re gonna want a say in the 
                        arrangements.

           BOBBY thinks.

                                 BOBBY
                        Take the meeting.  See what they 
                        want.

           NANCY steps into the EAST ROOM.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?  Everyone?

           The CROWD turns and quiets.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Kennedy and the children will 
                        be down in a moment.  Please take 
                        your seats.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           JACKIE’S POV... as she enters the EAST ROOM.  Everyone is 
           seated and they all turn to gaze at her and the children.  

           We see the compassionate and anguished faces of each guest as 
           JACKIE strides down the center aisle, CAROLINE and JOHN JR on 
           either side of her.  They take their seats in the front row 
           and JACKIE nods to the priest, FATHER KAVANAUGH.

                                 FATHER KAVANAUGH
                        Requiem æternam dona eis, Domine, 
                        et lux perpetua luceat eis. Te
                        decet hymnus Deus, in Sion, et tibi
                        reddetur votum in Ierusalem...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST SITTING ROOM  

           The immediate family has retired to the FAMILY ROOM in the 
           WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE.  JACKIE and BOBBY are seated with 
           ROSE, the matriarch of the Kennedy clan. 

                                 ROSE
                        That was a beautiful mass.
                                 BOBBY
                        Yes, mother.

                                 ROSE
                        Joe Jr., Kick, and now Jack. At his 
                        peak.  

           There is nothing to say.  

           ROSE looks to JACKIE, who appears drained and exhausted.  The 
           adrenaline of the previous day and night has long since worn 
           off.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        How are you dear?

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh, I don’t know.  Not well.

           ROSE merely nods.  

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        All these people.  The children.  
                        It’s all so much.

                                 ROSE
                        It is. I know.  Better than I’d 
                        like.

           ROSE turns to BOBBY...

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        What will we do about the funeral?  
                        How will we accommodate all these 
                        people in Brookline?

                                 JACKIE
                        Brookline? 

                                 BOBBY
                        The family plot is in Brookline. 

                                 ROSE
                        I assume Jack will be buried with 
                        the rest of us.  It’s only a matter 
                        of time for your father as well.

           JACKIE absorbs this.

                                 BOBBY
                        There’s been some talk of 
                        Arlington.  Bob McNamara seems to 
                        think Jack might have wanted that.
                                 ROSE
                             (displeased)
                        I see.

           JACKIE is staring off, blank. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Jackie?  How do you feel?

           She remains in her reverie, but slowly answers.

                                 JACKIE
                        It should be someplace grand. Where 
                        people can visit.  He belongs to 
                        the country now, I think. As much 
                        as to us.  

           ROSE looks to BOBBY.

                                 BOBBY
                        Yes, well, let’s have Bob take a 
                        look.  There’s still time to 
                        decide.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - VALENTI’S OFFICE

           VALENTI sits behind his desk in the OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE 
           BUILDING, calling members of Congress.  

                                 VALENTI
                             (into phone)
                        Yes... Yes... We understand.  The 
                        President agrees.  There mustn’t be 
                        any appearance of a gap in 
                        leadership.

           O’BRIEN appears in the door and waits.

                                 VALENTI (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Okay Congressman.  I’ll let him 
                        know.  Goodbye now.

           VALENTI hangs up.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        What’s the mood on the Hill?

                                 VALENTI
                        Concerned.  Distraught, of course.  
                        And concerned.
           O’BRIEN enters and sits.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I understand you wanted to talk 
                        about the funeral?

                                 VALENTI
                        Just looking to be kept in the 
                        loop.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Well, don’t know much yet.  Haven’t 
                        even picked a burial site.  
                        McNamara’s headed up to Arlington 
                        to loop for a spot.  But frankly, 
                        most of the family prefers 
                        Brookline.

                                 VALENTI
                        I see.  And this procession?

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Procession?

                                 VALENTI
                        We hear Mrs. Kennedy wants some 
                        kind of march?

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I don’t know about that.  She may 
                        have mentioned something on the 
                        plane, but given her state of mind-- 

                                 VALENTI
                        Of course.  Well, we all want to 
                        follow her lead.  But, there are 
                        other considerations.  We still 
                        don’t know much about this Oswald.  
                        There may be co-conspirators.  

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I’ll talk to her.  Find out what I 
                        can. But he was her husband.  
                        She’ll bury him how she damn well 
                        pleases.

           VALENTI decides to let it go for the moment.

                                 VALENTI
                        There’s another matter.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Yes?
                                 VALENTI
                        The Oval.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        What about it?

                                 VALENTI
                        There’s a feeling that the 
                        President should occupy it as soon 
                        as possible.  It’s important.  
                        Symbolically.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        What do you want me to do first -- 
                        plan the funeral or pack the 
                        furniture?

                                 VALENTI
                        I know this is delicate.  And 
                        that’s why I’m approaching you.  To 
                        help us work out the timing.  But 
                        we can’t wait indefinitely.  The 
                        country needs to see that there’s a 
                        skipper at the helm.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I’m not sure they’ll care where the 
                        skipper’s desk is.

                                 VALENTI
                        There’s also the matter of an 
                        address.  To the public and to 
                        Congress.  We’d like to send him up 
                        to the Hill sometime next week.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I’ll talk it over with Bobby.

                                 VALENTI
                        Thank you.

           O’BRIEN gets up to leave.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Anything else?

                                 VALENTI
                        Larry, just remember what I said 
                        about this procession idea.  A 
                        crowd full of people.  Given what’s 
                        happened, I just can’t have my 
                        president walking. 
                                 O’BRIEN
                        I understand, Jack.  Regardless of 
                        what happens, my president is going 
                        to be carried in a box.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST SITTING ROOM 

           Most of the immediate family is gone, but JACKIE is hardly 
           alone.  CAROLINE and JOHN JR play under the supervision of 
           MAUDE.  

           NANCY, MARY, and JACKIE’S mother, JANET, remain, carrying on 
           conversation which JACKIE seems not to notice.

                                 JANET
                        Bob doesn’t have to do that.  
                        Averell Harriman owns at least four 
                        properties in Georgetown.  I’m sure 
                        he could loan out one of them?

                                 NANCY
                        I’ll ask Sargent to look into it.  
                        I’m sure we have time.  They can’t 
                        expect us to move immediately, can 
                        they?

                                 JANET
                        Of course not.  Don’t be silly.

           NANCY picks up a phone.  While she dials...

                                 JACKIE
                        Mary?

                                 MARY
                        Yes?

                                 JACKIE
                        Will you bring me some stationary?

                                 MARY
                        Yes, right away.  Is there 
                        something I can do for you?

                                 JACKIE
                        That policeman in Dallas.  I must 
                        remember to write a note to his 
                        widow.
                                 MARY
                        Right away... 

           As MARY exits, SHRIVER enters the room.  NANCY rises to greet 
           him...

                                 NANCY
                        I just tried to reach you --

           And JACKIE notices his arrival.

                                 JACKIE
                        Sarge, you look harried!

                                 SHRIVER
                        Not at all, Mrs. Kennedy.  Just 
                        doing my best to keep track of all 
                        the details.

                                 JACKIE
                        And how is all the planning?

                                 SHRIVER
                        It’s going well.  It will be a full 
                        house here tonight.  I never 
                        thought this place could run out of 
                        bedrooms.

                                 JACKIE
                        And the funeral itself?

                                 SHRIVER
                        Mr. Walton is doing everything he 
                        can to cover all the details.

                                 JACKIE
                        I trust you, of course.  I couldn’t 
                        deal with all this myself.
                             (beat)
                        I’m not sure any of it really 
                        matters.  Last night I did.  But 
                        now...

           JACKIE glances over at the children.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Now... I realize it must seem 
                        silly.  
                             (to NANCY)
                        We could have held the Mass in the 
                        dining room.  I’m sorry I made them 
                        move those chairs. 
                                 NANCY
                        Don’t be sorry.  Everyone just 
                        wants you to be pleased with the 
                        arrangements.

                                 JACKIE
                        None of it will bring him back.  
                        And I’m probably the only one who 
                        notices.  But what do people expect 
                        you to do?  Just sit in a corner 
                        and weep?  

                                 SHRIVER
                        I’ll keep you informed of 
                        everything.  But do try not to 
                        worry.

                                 JANET
                        He’s right, dear.  Soon enough this 
                        will all be over.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY

           A sea of familiar WHITE CROSSES, bathed in a thick mist.  

           The 420 acres of ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY are shrouded in 
           rain and clouds, as MACNAMARA, O’DONNELL, and the cemetery’s 
           SUPERINTENDENT JOHN METZLER, trudge through the mud.

           As we find them among the endless graves...

                                 METZLER
                        The third option is right up here.  
                        At the base of the hill.

           Ahead is a sprawling green slope, atop of which is ROBERT E. 
           LEE’S MANSION, a massive Greek-Revival structure of white 
           marble, with 8 thick, imposing Athenian columns.

           METZLER stops at the base of the hill, and the others survey 
           the surroundings.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        What do you think Ken?

                                 O’DONNELL
                        I did like Dewey Circle.  If we 
                        could get rid of the leaves in 
                        time.
                                 METZLER
                        Problem there is not just the 
                        leaves.  It’s the access roads.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        Never mind.  This is the spot as 
                        far as I’m concerned.  Now, can we 
                        get it done?

                                 METZLER
                        I’ll have to call Interior.  This 
                        here is Park Service Land, not DOD.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        Well, make the call.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAROLINE KENNEDY’S BEDROOM

           CAROLINE and JOHN JR are on the floor of CAROLINE’S bedroom 
           writing with crayons.  JACKIE stands in the doorway with 
           MAUD.

                                 JACKIE
                        And you’ll make sure they get 
                        supper at 5?

                                 MAUD
                        Of course.

           JACKIE turns to leave.  MAUD hesitates, then...

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        Caroline asked if she could write a 
                        note to her father.  To say 
                        goodbye.

           JACKIE is heartbroken.  She turns back and takes another look 
           at them scribbling. They are carefully forming letters with 
           their crayons.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        I thought it would be okay.  But I 
                        didn’t want to upset you. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Not at all.  

           JACKIE steps into the room and kneels down with the children.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Caroline? John?
           They look up expectantly.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Make sure you tell Daddy how much 
                        you love him.  And when you’re 
                        through, I’ll be sure he gets your 
                        notes.  I promise.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Thanks, Mommy.

                                 JOHN JR.
                        Thank you, Mommy.

           JOHN JR crawls forward and embraces his mom, as we...

           A motorcade of BLACK LINCOLNS winds through the rows of 
           graves, pulling to a stop at the base of LEE MANSION.  

           The doors of the LINCOLNS swing open and the passengers 
           emerge amid a phalanx of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. JACKIE 
           strides forth under a canopy of umbrellas, accompanied by 
           BOBBY and WALTON.   

           O’DONNELL, MCNAMARA, and METZLER are waiting.  By now, they 
           are soaked to the bone.

                        Welcome to Arlington, Mrs. Kennedy.

           JACKIE shivers in the damp cold.

                                 JACKIE
                        Thank you.
                                 MCNAMARA
                        We thought somewhere on this slope.

           JACKIE glances around, unsure.

                                 MCNAMARA (CONT’D)
                        Take your time.

           JACKIE steps out from under the umbrellas to walk the hill.  
           BOBBY grabs one and quickly follows, trying to keep her under 
           cover.

           She walks to the top of the slope, slipping more than a few 
           times, until she’s at the front of LEE MANSION staring down.

           JACKIE’S POV... as she surveys the endless graves and mist 
           below.  She turns to BOBBY... 

                                 JACKIE
                        Caroline points out this Mansion 
                        every time we drive by. I think it 
                        was the first landmark in 
                        Washington she recognized. The 
                        light and the pillars.

           JACKIE makes eye contact with WALTON, who remains at the 
           bottom of the hill.  WALTON simply nods.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                             (to BOBBY)
                        This is it.

           WALTON turns to METZLER, who’s holding a wooden STAKE.

                                 WALTON
                        May I?

           METZLER hands him the stake, and WALTON walks directly to a 
           spot in the center of the hill, driving the STAKE into the 
           ground, as we...

                        Speculation continues over the 
                        precise sequence of events in 
                        Dallas.  Witness accounts abound, 
                        of questionable reliability, but no 
                        one from that fateful motorcade has 
                        yet to speak with reporters.

           The phone rings and we pull back to see VALENTI.  He 
           answers...

                             (into phone)
                        So, it’s Arlington?... Damnit.

           VALENTI hangs up, and shouts out his open door...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

           BOBBY is back at this desk, in his small office adjacent to 
           the OVAL.  His hair still wet, his tie loose, he holds court 
           with O’BRIEN, O’DONNELL, and SHRIVER.

                                 BOBBY
                        Where are we?

                                 SHRIVER
                        We’ve found beds for almost all the 
                        family.  Truman is at Blair House.  
                        There was a brief crisis about him 
                        not having a driver, but Ike 
                        offered his.

                        It’s been a mess today, but it’ll 
                        all get sorted out.

                                 O’DONNELL
                        We’re running a bed and breakfast.

                                 BOBBY
                             (to O’BRIEN)
                        What did Valenti say?
                                 O’BRIEN
                        They want to move into the Oval.  
                        And they want him to go to the 
                        Hill.

                                 BOBBY
                        I know what they want.  When do 
                        they want it?

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I think they’ll hold off til mid-
                        week.

                                 O’DONNELL
                        That’s generous.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        They’re in a bind, Kenny.  I think 
                        they know they need to tread 
                        lightly.

                                 BOBBY
                        That it?

                                 O’BRIEN
                        He also brought up the funeral.

                                 BOBBY
                        What about it?

                                 O’BRIEN
                        They know Mrs. Kennedy has Bill 
                        Walton working off the Lincoln 
                        books.  They’re worried about an 
                        outdoor procession.

                                 BOBBY
                        Lyndon too lazy to walk?

                                 O’BRIEN
                        They think it’s a security risk.  

                                 O’DONNELL
                        Everyone’s spooked.  Apparently 
                        they’ve even had State discouraging 
                        foreign dignitaries from attending.

                                 BOBBY
                        What?

                                 O’DONNELL
                        It ain’t working.  Even De Gaulle 
                        is insisting on coming.
                                 BOBBY
                        How far is it to Saint Matthews?  
                        Eight blocks?  That’s a long way to 
                        be strolling through crowds. It’s 
                        not unreasonable.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Jackie seems to want it.

                                 BOBBY
                        I’ll talk to her.  She’s still in a 
                        daze.  She may not be sure what she 
                        wants.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY

           JACKIE and NANCY are walking...

                                 JACKIE
                        What else is still to be decided?

                                 NANCY
                        The Attorney General is sorting out 
                        who from Congress will speak at 
                        tomorrow’s ceremony.  I believe 
                        they were discussing the Majority 
                        Leader, Senator Mansfield --

           But JACKIE has stopped and is no longer paying attention.  
           She stands at the door to a darkened room, THE LINCOLN 
           BEDROOM.

           JACKIE’S POV... The arched MAHOGANY BED, flanked on either 
           side by portraits of ABRAHAM and MARY TODD LINCOLN.  She 
           lingers on the widow...

                                 JACKIE (O.S.)
                        She was destitute.  After her 
                        husband’s murder.  She returned to 
                        Illinois, and had to sell her 
                        furniture.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 NANCY
                        Mrs. Kennedy, there’s no chance 
                        that will --
                                 JACKIE
                        She died with nothing, and yet for 
                        centuries to come, kings and queens 
                        will lie down in this bedroom.

           Back to..

           JACKIE’S POV... now lingering on the dead President.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING

           A KNOCK on VALENTI’S open door. It’s CLINT HILL, the head of 
           JACKIE’S Secret Service Detail.  Twenty four hours ago he 
           raced into the line of fire, leapt onto the back of the 
           Presidential Limo and quite possibly saved the First Lady’s 
           life.  He has been on duty nearly non-stop since.

           VALENTI looks up and notices HILL is sopping wet.

                                 VALENTI
                        Clint! C’mon in.  You’re soaked.

           HILL steps into the office tentatively.  

                                 VALENTI (CONT’D)
                        Sit down.  Close the door.  Relax.

           HILL obliges.

                                 HILL
                        Yes, sir.

                                 VALENTI
                        You take a swim?

                                 HILL
                        Just back from Arlington, sir. The 
                        rain hasn’t let up.

                                 VALENTI
                        That’s right.  I hear Mrs. Kennedy 
                        picked a lovely spot.

                                 HILL
                        Yes, sir.
                             (beat)
                        Mr. Valenti, no disrespect, but I 
                        haven’t been home since Dallas.  I 
                        have a few hours off right now and 
                        was on my way out when I got your 
                        message.
                                 VALENTI
                        Of course, I’m sorry.  This won’t 
                        take more than a moment.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - JACKIE’S BEDROOM

           JACKIE has changed out of her black dress and into more 
           casual attire.  She sits at her desk writing furiously when a 
           KNOCK interrupts her...  

                                 JACKIE
                        Come in!

           DR. WALSH enters.

                                 DR. WALSH
                        Am I interrupting?

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh, Dr. Walsh.  Not at all.  I 
                        didn’t know you were here.

           DR. WALSH gestures to the pile of stationary...

                                 DR. WALSH
                        You shouldn’t be straining with 
                        that.

                                 JACKIE
                        It’s not a strain.  Actually I’m 
                        finding it helps.  To think of 
                        others right now.

           DR. WALSH sits on the edge of the bed, nearest the desk. 

                                 DR. WALSH
                        Bobby thought you might like 
                        another shot tonight.  To help you 
                        sleep.

           JACKIE considers it.

                                 JACKIE
                        Thank you, Doctor.  But I think I 
                        may try to rest on my own.  I’ll 
                        have to eventually.

                                 DR. WALSH
                        There’s no shame it.  Anyone in 
                        your shoes would be wracked with 
                        grief and anxiety.
                                 JACKIE
                        I know.  And I know Bobby was only 
                        being thoughtful.

           She’s made up her mind.  DR. WALSH gets up.

                                 DR. WALSH
                        Well, tell Nancy if you change your 
                        mind.  She has my number.

           As he turns to leave...

                                 JACKIE
                        I think I might write a letter to 
                        Jack.

           He turns back.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s not some symptom of 
                        hysteria, is it?

           DR. WALSH is not sure how to respond to such an intimate 
           confession.

                        I wouldn’t call it hysteria.

                        It sounds like a fine thing to do.

                                 JACKIE
                        It was the children’s idea.  At 
                        first I thought, how grim! But, 
                        then... I just can’t help but feel 
                        there’s a window closing.  To say 
                        certain things.

                                 DR. WALSH
                        If I may, Mrs. Kennedy... The whole 
                        country feels like a window is 
                        closing.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING

           A hushed murmur as STAFFERS stop and stare at JACKIE, now 
           walking through the halls of residence...

           Past the FAMILY DINING ROOM... where ETHEL, ROSE, the 
           LAWFORDS, the MCNAMARAS, and the AUCHINCLOSS’S are sipping 
           coffee...
           Into the WEST WING... and past the office of JB WEST, who 
           looks up from his papers...

           Past the offices of O’DONNELL and O’BRIEN...both working the 
           phone furiously... 

           Past SHRIVER, who’s directing a group of YOUNG AIDES on their 
           responsibilities tomorrow...

           Past AIR FORCE GENERAL GODFREY MCHUGH, the President’s 
           military attache, putting the finishing touches on a 
           makeshift cot in his office...

           JACKIE makes eye contact with each, offering a comforting 
           glance, and seeming to take comfort herself from all these 
           friends’ presence.

           Until she arrives, alone, at the EAST ROOM, guarded by two 
           MARINES.

                                 JACKIE
                        Gentlemen, may I have a moment?

           The MARINES look to each other, and then notice that BOBBY is 
           behind her.  BOBBY nods his ascent.  The MARINES offer a 
           crisp salute and exit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM

           BOBBY’s POV... as JACKIE slowly approaches the CATAFALQUE, in 
           the empty, dimly lit room.

           JACKIE kneels and bows her head.  After a moment, she rises 
           and appears to struggle.  She’s trying to open the CASKET.

           BOBBY suddenly moves forward and JACKIE startles, noticing 
           his presence.

                                 JACKIE
                             (relieved)
                        It’s you.

                                 BOBBY
                        I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to scare 
                        you.  
                             (beat)
                        They told me you were heading this 
                        way.  Is there anything I can get 
                        you?

           JACKIE holds up three ENVELOPES and a SILVER ROSARY.
                                 JACKIE
                        I’d like to leave these with Jack.  
                        Will you help me with the coffin?

           BOBBY hesitates, but JACKIE has never looked more pained than 
           in this moment.  He steps to the CASKET, and first, gently 
           folds back the FLAG draped across it.  Then, with a heave, he 
           opens the lid, and stares transfixed by his dead brother.

           JACKIE steps beside him and now forces herself to look at the 
           corpse of her husband.  She lets out a barely audible gasp.

                                 BOBBY
                        Jackie--

                                 JACKIE
                        It doesn’t even look like him.  
                        It’s like something from a wax 
                        museum.

           BOBBY can’t help but agree.  He is sickened.

                                 BOBBY
                        I’ll make sure it stays closed 
                        tomorrow.

           JACKIE tucks the ENVELOPES, one by one, and the ROSARY into 
           the CASKET.  She then takes a small SCISSORS out of her 
           pocket, and gently cuts a LOCK of her husband’s hair.

           JACKIE leans forward as if she might kiss the body, but 
           instead collapses into a fit of weeping.  BOBBY grabs her, 
           holding her upright.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Help!  Can someone help in here?!

           The sun rises on a dry, but still frigid grey day.  All along 
           the sidewalks leading up to the CAPITOL, MOURNERS begin to 
           line up, huddling together, while inside the Capitol...

           in state, arranging velvet ropes to control the expected 
           crowds.  
           The cavernous chamber is empty, and only the bare catafalque 
           sits beneath the center of the dome, draped in black cloth, 
           waiting, as we...

           JACKIE also draped in black cloth -- in this case a silk slip 
           -- while NANCY arranges the rest of her outfit on the bed.  

           JACKIE holds a copy of that morning’s WASHINGTON POST, and 
           while she’s rebounded from the emotion of the night before, 
           her brow is furrowed in obvious distress.  

                                 NANCY
                        Where did you get that?  It’s only 
                        upsetting you.

                                 JACKIE
                        I asked Mary to bring it earlier.  
                        I wanted to see what they’re 
                        saying.

                                 NANCY
                        Everyone is anguished.  They must 
                        be writing about that.

                                 JACKIE
                        They are.  But not just that.

                        else.  A hundred years ago.

           JACKIE sits with her back to the door at her vanity, as NANCY 
           helps her affix a BLACK VEIL.  HILL waits patiently in the 
           threshold.  JACKIE sees him in her mirror...

                             (into the mirror)
                        Did you sleep last night?

                        turn.

           HILL is not sure how to reply.

                        I’m sorry, ma’am.

           NANCY makes her final adjustment.  JACKIE makes one of her 
           own, and then rises.

                        Of course.  Nancy, go see if the

                        Mrs. Kennedy.

           Still JACKIE reaches out and touches his arm -- an expression 
           of the deepest gratitude.  HILL is taken aback.  He can’t 
           look her in the eye.  But JACKIE seems to need this, and only 
           after a long moment does she release his arm.

                        November...

           PRESIDENT JOHNSON looks at his watch.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        They gonna do this thing already?

           On the TELEVISION... A MAN steps into the frame, blocking the 
           camera, and then rushes out of the way.  Suddenly a flurry of 
           activity as PHOTOGRAPHERS race into position, and DETECTIVES 
           in Stetson hats emerge from the corridor.    

           Suddenly the REPORTERS surge forward, blocking the camera 
           again...

                                 BRINKLEY
                             (on TV)
                        He appears to be coming --

           And then... out of the crowd, RUBY runs across the screen  
           and fires the fatal SHOT, as we... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - JACKIE’S BEDROOM

                                 HILL
                        I’m suggesting you consider the 
                        danger.

                                 JACKIE
                        And, if I have?
                                 HILL
                        Then, we’ll make sure you’re 
                        protected.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BLUE ROOM

           An eruption of mayhem... 

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON 
                        What the hell just happened?!

                                 BOBBY
                             (to O’BRIEN)

                        Oh dear god!

           To match the mayhem on television...

                        Oswald has been shot.  Oswald has 
                        been shot.  Lee Harvey Oswald has 
                        been shot.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - JACKIE’S BEDROOM

           A KNOCK puts an end to JACKIE and HILL’S conversation.  NANCY 
           pokes her head in the room...

                                 NANCY
                        Caroline and John are ready.

                                 JACKIE
                        Thank you, Nancy.

                                 NANCY
                        I’ll take them downstairs to ride 
                        with Maud.

           As NANCY turns to leave, JACKIE considers this, then...

                                 JACKIE
                        Nancy?
                                 NANCY
                        Yes?

                                 JACKIE
                        I’d like them to come with me.

                                 NANCY
                        There’s a mob of reporters out 
                        front.  I thought you’d prefer --

                                 JACKIE
                        Not today.  Their father is leaving 
                        this house for the last time.  They 
                        should be there to say goodbye.

                                 NANCY
                        But the cameras?  These pictures 
                        will be broadcast to every corner 
                        of the world.

                                 JACKIE
                        And those pictures should record 
                        the truth.  Two heartbroken little 
                        children are a part of that.

                                 NANCY
                        I’ll let everyone know.

                                 JACKIE
                             (to HILL)
                        Clint, are we done?

                                 HILL
                        Yes, Mrs. Kennedy.

                                 JACKIE
                        Let’s go then.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BLUE ROOM

           BOBBY is on the phone in the corner, while the others remain 
           huddled around the TV.  PRESIDENT JOHNSON moves over to BOBBY 
           as he finishes his call.

                                 BOBBY
                             (into phone)
                        I want to know right away... Well 
                        get someone over to Parkland!  
                        Damnit!

           BOBBY slams down the phone.
                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Dead or alive?

                                 BOBBY
                        They’re not sure.  Hoover’s still 
                        trying to reach the Field Office.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                             (increasingly enraged)
                        This is a world-class shit-show.  
                        We need to get a handle on this 
                        thing.  We’ve got to get involved.  
                        It’s making us look like a bunch of 
                        goddamn barbarians!

           MARY is back at the door...

                                 MARY
                        Mrs. Kennedy is on her way down.  
                        With the children.

           BOBBY ignores JOHNSON’S outburst and addresses the room...

                                 BOBBY
                        Turn off the television!  And not a 
                        word of this.  I’ll tell Jackie 
                        when the time is right.  
                        Understood?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PORTICO

           JACKIE, CAROLINE, and JOHN JR step out onto the PORTICO, at 
           first squinting in the mid-day sun.  They take in the 
           extraordinary scene. 

           The horse-drawn CAISSON carrying the President’s flag-draped 
           CASKET is parked just before them, followed by a RIDERLESS 
           HORSE, and then a train of LIMOUSINES to carry the mourners.  
           In the lead is a DRUM CORPS.

           The WHITE HOUSE DRIVE is lined by parallel rows of SOLDIERS 
           carrying the flags of the 50 states. 

           The WHITE HOUSE LAWN is crowded with CAMERA CREWS, REPORTERS, 
           and STAFF.  All are reverent, silent. 

           FLASHBULBS erupt, capturing the indelible image...  The widow 
           in black.  The two innocent children in powder blue.  They 
           are still, and now frozen in time. 
           Then, the DRUM CORPS’ MUFFLED ROLL, which continues as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UNITED STATES CAPITOL - EAST STEPS

           ... the CAISSON coming to a stop at the base of the SENATE 
           STEPS, the trail of LIMOUSINES just behind.  An HONOR GUARD 
           and a NAVY BAND wait to receive them.

           The doors of the LIMOUSINES open, and JACKIE steps out, along 
           with CAROLINE, JOHN JR. and BOBBY.  PRESIDENT JOHNSON and 
           LADY BIRD emerge from the next car, and take up position 
           beside them.  As they do, JACKIE turns to the new 
           PRESIDENT... 

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh, Lyndon.  What an awful way for 
                        you to begin your presidency.

           Before he can reply...

                                 HONOR GUARD CAPTAIN
                        Pre-SENT!

           The HONOR GUARD raises their rifles.

                                 HONOR GUARD CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Fire!

           As the CASKET is lifted off the CAISSON and carried up the 
           SENATE STEPS...

           A TWENTY GUN SALUTE echoes, as the NAVY BAND starts to play 
           HAIL TO THE CHIEF, in a dirge adagio, punctuated by rife fire 
           every five seconds. As we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPITOL ROTUNDA

           JACKIE and CAROLINE trail the CASKET, stopping just short of 
           the CATAFALQUE as its placed atop it.  BOBBY helps JOHN JR to 
           a seat in the first row.

           As the HONOR GUARD steps aside, and the whole room silently 
           watching...
                                 JACKIE
                             (whispering to CAROLINE)
                        We’re going to tell Daddy how much 
                        we love him now.  And how much 
                        we’ll always miss him.

           JACKIE moves forward now, and CAROLINE steps forward, closely 
           watching.

           JACKIE kneels, and CAROLINE kneels beside her.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Just kiss.

           JACKIE presses her lips gently against the FLAG, and CAROLINE 
           follows. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - VICE PRESIDENT’S OFFICE

           VALENTI sits before PRESIDENT JOHNSON, who barks into the 
           phone.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                             (into phone)
                        He needs to be on the ground - in 
                        Dallas!...Well, call me when that 
                        happens...I get it Nick, but the 
                        Attorney General has other things 
                        on his mind.

           JOHNSON slams down the receiver.

                                 VALENTI
                        They sending Miller?

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Should have sent him two days ago.
                             (beat)
                        What else we got?

                                 VALENTI
                        Lodge and Rusk will brief on 
                        Vietnam at 4.  Then Gordon is 
                        coming by to go over the budget.  
                        It has to go to the printing office 
                        next week.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Good, good.  That could be a quick 
                        early win for us.

                        Show Wall Street we’re serious 
                        about cutting spending.

                                 VALENTI
                        Yes, sir.  We’ll make it a 
                        centerpiece of the speech this 
                        week.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        We hear back from Bobby on that?

                                 VALENTI
                        O’Brien says the family is okay 
                        with you doing it Wednesday.  

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        What do you think?

                                 VALENTI
                        Gives us a day between the funeral 
                        and the address.  We can live with 
                        it.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Alright.  And how about tomorrow?

                                 VALENTI
                        Last count was over 200 dignitaries 
                        arriving tonight and into the 
                        morning.  

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        My goodness.

                                 VALENTI
                        Rowley says it could take four 
                        thousand men to secure the route to 
                        Saint Matthews.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING

           Heads turn as JACKIE strolls through the WEST WING, toward 
           the OVAL OFFICE, which is still, dark and vacant...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE

           She steps inside...

           There is the RESOLUTE DESK, which her son, JOHN JR, was 
           famously photographed playing beneath.   
           On top of the desk is the COCONUT the PRESIDENT used to 
           scrawl a rescue message when his boat was sunk in the South 
           Pacific. 

           There is the ROCKING CHAIR, her husband relaxed in.  The 
           MODEL of the naval vessel, The Danmark, he meticulously 
           constructed.

           As JACKIE studies each object, WALTON joins her. 

           JACKIE kneels and runs her hand across the CARPET.

                                 JACKIE
                        It’s perfect.

                                 WALTON
                        We finished installing it while you 
                        were in Dallas.  I thought it would 
                        be nice a surprise for you and the 
                        President.

                                 JACKIE
                        It changes the whole room, doesn’t 
                        it?  It’s so grand and majestic.

           JACKIE rises and turns on the LIGHT SWITCH.  We now see that 
           the CARPET is a piercing SCARLET.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        And the Treaty Room?

                                 WALTON
                        Hunter green.  Exactly as you 
                        imagined it.

                                 JACKIE
                        I wish Jack --.

           She trails off.

                                 WALTON
                        What you’ve done here... It will 
                        last forever.

                                 JACKIE
                        Will it?  A week from now, a month 
                        from now... What will be left of 
                        us?

                                 WALTON
                        The country won’t forget.
                                 JACKIE
                        That’s kind of you, Bill.  But this 
                        won’t last forever.  They’re 
                        already writing about Jack like 
                        he’s some dusty relic. Another 
                        ghost in the oil portraits that 
                        line these hallways.

           INT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - VICE PRESIDENT’S OFFICE

           AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT LODGE stands beside a MAP of SOUTHEAST 
           ASIA, as he winds down a briefing on the situation in 
           Vietnam.  

           PRESIDENT JOHNSON sits behind his desk, and SECRETARY OF 
           STATE DEAN RUSK sits beside VALENTI.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Thank you Henry.  You keep us 
                        posted. 

                                 LODGE
                        I will Mr. President.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        When are you back to Saigon?

                                 LODGE
                        After the funeral.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Fly safe.

           LODGE gathers his MAP, and RUSK rises to exit along with him.  
           VALENTI catches him in the HALLWAY...

           INT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - HALLWAY

                                 VALENTI
                        Mr. Secretary, do you have a 
                        moment?

                                 RUSK
                        Of course.

                                 VALENTI
                        I need you to run out to Andrews.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

           BOBBY looks up to find JACKIE in his doorway.

                                 BOBBY
                        Jackie.  I thought you were 
                        upstairs in the sitting room.

                                 JACKIE
                        I wanted to see the renovations.  
                        In the West Wing.

                                 BOBBY
                        You should get some rest.  For 
                        tomorrow.

                                 JACKIE
                        Are the Pipers arranged?

                                 BOBBY
                        Yes.  Sarge says it’s all taken 
                        care of.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m told there’s some concern over 
                        the procession.

                                 BOBBY
                        Lyndon’s people are spooked.

                                 JACKIE
                        And you?

                                 BOBBY
                        After today, with what happened in 
                        Dallas... Are you sure it’s what 
                        you want?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - VALENTI’S OFFICE

           VALENTI looks up from this desk to see JACKIE.  He stands up, 
           fumbling...

                                 VALENTI
                        Mrs. Kennedy, I, uh --

                                 JACKIE
                        Please, I’m so sorry to bother.
                                 VALENTI
                        Not at all.  How can I help you?  
                        Would you like some water?

                                 JACKIE
                        No, thank you.  I won’t take up 
                        much of your time.  I know how busy 
                        you must be.  I remember when we 
                        won the election...How overwhelming 
                        it was.  You must be going mad.

                                 VALENTI
                        We’re doing just fine.  Everyone’s 
                        thoughts are with you, right now, 
                        Mrs. Kennedy.

                                 JACKIE
                        That’s kind of you.  But I 
                        understand business must get done.  
                        I’ve come to discuss tomorrow’s 
                        procession.  There’s a problem?

                                 VALENTI
                        Well, not a problem.  I’m sure you 
                        can understand... The Secret 
                        Service has some concerns.  
                        Especially after today, who can 
                        blame them?

                                 JACKIE
                        And President Johnson?

                                 VALENTI
                        President Johnson would like 
                        nothing more than to fulfill your 
                        wishes.  But, I have to take into 
                        account his safety.  The country 
                        couldn’t endure another blow right 
                        now.  

           JACKIE appears wounded. 

                                 VALENTI (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean -- If it were up to 
                        him, he’d do anything that might 
                        bring you comfort. We all would.

                                 JACKIE
                        Then, who is it up to, Mr. Valenti?

                                 VALENTI
                        We’re expecting close to a hundred 
                        Heads of State.  I suspect they’ll 
                        all make their own decisions.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 VALENTI (CONT'D)
                        There’s not much we can do to force 
                        it. Given the situation.

           JACKIE considers this.

                                 JACKIE
                        Well, I’m going to walk with Jack.  
                        And whoever wants can walk beside 
                        me.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE

           A traffic jam of AIRPLANES converging from every corner of 
           the world.  RUSK wades through the GROUND CREW and various 
           FOREIGN DELEGATIONS as they come streaming onto the tarmac, 
           while STATE DEPT PROTOCOL OFFICERS struggle to maintain some 
           semblance of order.  RUSK pulls one aside...

                                 RUSK
                        Where’s the French delegation?

                                 PROTOCOL OFFICER
                        Mr. Secretary, I, uh...

                                 RUSK
                        De Gaulle.  Where’s his plane?

           The PROTOCOL OFFICER consults a messy clipboard...

                                 PROTOCOL OFFICER
                        Hangar 47, sir.  That’s the second 
                        on the right.  Can I escort you --

           But RUSK is already lost in the crowd.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - HANGAR 47

           French President CHARLES DE GAULLE has deplaned along with 
           his wife YVONNE, and their retinue of ATTENDANTS.  Relations 
           with France have never been worse, and DE GAULLE’S presence 
           is an extraordinary statement.

           DE GAULLE’S delegation is about to enter the waiting 
           LIMOUSINES when RUSK trots into view, his footsteps echoing 
           in the cavernous hangar..

                                 RUSK
                        General!  General De Gaulle!
           DE GAULLE turns and his SECURITY DETAIL immediately moves to 
           intervene.  But as RUSK gets closer DE GAULLE recognizes him 
           and shoos his protection away with typical derision.

                                 DE GAULLE
                             (in French)
                        No. No. Fools. It’s Rusk. He works 
                        for the President.

           The SECURITY DETAIL relaxes, and RUSK walks up, now catching 
           his breath...

                                 RUSK
                        General, I’m glad I caught you.

                                 DE GAULLE
                             (in English)
                        This is quite a welcome. Are you 
                        here to send me home to Paris?  

                                 RUSK
                        We’re honored you came.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        And yet I suspect there will be no 
                        Cabinet minister greeting King 
                        Boudoin as he steps off the plane.

                                 RUSK
                        We thought this was the best 
                        opportunity to catch you in 
                        private.  

                                 DE GAULLE
                        And?

           RUSK looks around, and realizes there is no better place in 
           the hangar to have this conversation.

                                 RUSK
                             (hushed)
                        We’ve intercepted a threat.  From 
                        assets in Geneva.  A plot to 
                        assassinate you during tomorrow’s 
                        funeral procession.

                                 DE GAULLE
                             (full volume)
                        I have survived four such attempts.  
                        You know that, don’t you?

                                 RUSK
                        I do.
                                 DE GAULLE
                        So what would you have me do?

                                 RUSK
                        We thought you might ride to the 
                        cathedral, in an armored vehicle.  
                        If you’ll agree, I suspect others 
                        will do the same.  This is not the 
                        only threat.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        And, Mrs. Kennedy?  She will hide 
                        in a tank as well?

           RUSK dodges the question.

                                 RUSK
                        It would be a courtesy to Mrs. 
                        Kennedy not to endanger your life.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        A courtesy?
                             (beat)
                        Mr. Secretary, I am here to execute 
                        the will of the French people.  
                        There is an enormous outpouring of 
                        emotion.  What do you think they 
                        would they say if they saw that 
                        beautiful girl marching all alone, 
                        and their president cowering behind 
                        steel and rifles?

           RUSK knows there’s no use arguing.

                                 RUSK
                        I understand, General.  And thank 
                        you again for coming. 

           RUSK walks away and DE GAULLE opens the door of the 
           LIMOUSINE.  As he ducks to get inside, we see O’BRIEN. 

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Thank you, General.  Mrs. Kennedy 
                        will be very grateful.  Now, let’s 
                        get going.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY

           NANCY walks through the RESIDENCE.  At each door, she 
           succinctly knocks and...
                                 NANCY
                        Mrs. Kennedy?

           ... before moving onto the next one.

           Until she arrives at PRESIDENT KENNEDY’S BEDROOM.  She stops.  
           It couldn’t be... But maybe... NANCY slowly opens the door to 
           the darkened room...

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Kennedy?

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENTIAL BEDROOM

           ... and finds JACKIE seated on the edge of PRESIDENT 
           KENNEDY’S four-poster bed.  This is our first glimpse at the 
           PRESIDENT’S private quarters.  The BEDSIDE TABLE is stacked 
           high with books, and PILL BOTTLES.

           At the foot of the bed is another TABLE, with more MAGAZINES, 
           and RUBBER BOATS, JOHN JR’S bath toys.

                                 NANCY
                        I’m sorry, Mrs. Kennedy.  I’ve been 
                        looking all over. 

           JACKIE seems oblivious to NANCY’s presence.

                                 JACKIE
                        I don’t know how many times I’ve 
                        even been in this room. We hardly 
                        ever spent the night together.
                             (beat)
                        We didn’t that last night in Fort 
                        Worth.  

                                 NANCY
                        Would you like to be alone?

                                 JACKIE
                        How long have we been together, 
                        Nancy?  You and I?

                                 NANCY
                        Oh, I don’t know.  Since Miss 
                        Chapin’s. Since we were just 
                        little girls.

                                 JACKIE
                        It’s funny... I always worried that 
                        you might be jealous.
                                 NANCY
                        Oh Jackie...

                                 JACKIE
                        You never did anything to make me 
                        feel that way.  You’ve been nothing 
                        but loyal.  But I worried.  After I 
                        married Jack.  And after he won the 
                        election.

           NANCY is not sure how to respond.  But she is no longer an 
           employee, just an old friend, and she settles into the 
           PRESIDENT’S READING CHAIR across from JACKIE.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        But now?  That must seem silly.  
                        Anyone being jealous.  I’ve buried 
                        two children and now my husband.

           After a moment...

                                 NANCY
                        I was jealous.  Of that dress you 
                        wore in Vienna.

           JACKIE laughs, grateful for the release.

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh Nance - you always know what to 
                        say.

                                 NANCY
                        It may be hard to see right now, 
                        but you have your whole life ahead 
                        of you. Starting over will be hard.  
                        But it’s a chance to do some things 
                        better.

                                 JACKIE
                        Jack wasn’t perfect.  You think I 
                        don’t know that?  But I picture him 
                        in that rocking chair in his 
                        office.  
                             (beat)
                        That was the one piece of furniture 
                        he just wouldn’t part with in the 
                        renovation.  John and Caroline at 
                        his feet... 

                                 NANCY
                        He was a wonderful father.
                                 JACKIE
                        He inspired people.  Made them 
                        imagine their own potential.  No 
                        matter what he did, I never stopped 
                        believing in his.
                             (beat)
                        Does that make me a fool, Nancy?

                                 NANCY
                        Not unless we were all fools.  We 
                        all believed in him.

                                 JACKIE
                        And now it’s over.

                                 NANCY
                        You’re here. And Bobby. And the 
                        children.  

                                 JACKIE
                        I can’t have them spend their lives 
                        chasing Jack’s legacy.  If I do 
                        nothing else, I want them to grow 
                        up normally, and to get jobs, and 
                        to be happy.

           NANCY leans forward and reaches out for JACKIE’S hand.

                                 NANCY
                        When you first asked, I didn’t want 
                        to work here.  Do you remember?

                                 JACKIE
                        Barely.  Something about not having 
                        the training.

                                 NANCY
                        I worked in a travel agency.  What 
                        did I know about planning State 
                        Dinners?  But you convinced me, and 
                        I was nervous as can be.  And for 
                        the first few weeks, I wondered if 
                        I’d made a terrible mistake.  All 
                        the stuffy formality.  The layers 
                        of authority.  The eyes on us both.  
                        And, then, that blimp came to town.

           JACKIE laughs at the memory.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        And you took John and Caroline and 
                        raced out to the airfield and took 
                        them floating over the hills of 
                        Virginia.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I thought the Secret Service would 
                        have a heart attack, racing below 
                        trying to keep track of that 
                        balloon...

                                 JACKIE
                             (warmly)
                        Jack gave me a stern talking to 
                        after that little adventure. 

                                 NANCY
                        Those are the luckiest children on 
                        earth.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m just so terrified.

                                 NANCY
                        I know.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. UNITED STATES CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

           A bright and clear November morning.  An HONOR GUARD emerges 
           onto the SENATE STEPS, carrying the PRESIDENT’S CASKET. 

           As the GUARD slowly descends each of the THIRTY SIX STEPS, 
           we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CAROLINE KENNEDY’S BEDROOM

           ...a sad celebration of JOHN JR’s 3rd birthday.  JACKIE, 
           NANCY, MAUD, and CAROLINE sing to the little boy...

                                 JACKIE
                        Happy Birthday to you, Happy 
                        Birthday to you, Happy Birthday 
                        Dear John, Happy Birthday to 
                        you....

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TREASURY DEPT - SECRET SERVICE ARMORY

           A line of uniformed SECRET SERVICE AGENTS jammed all along a 
           a narrow corridor, each stepping forward, one-by-one to be 
           handed a high-powered RIFLE...
                                 SUPERVISING AGENT
                             (shouting)
                        Remember gentlemen -- safety’s on, 
                        but chambers loaded!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CAROLINE KENNEDY’S BEDROOM

           JACKIE presents JOHN with two presents... a TOY HELICOPTER 
           and a picture book...

                                 JOHN JR.
                        Peter Rabbit!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UNITED STATES CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

           As the HONOR GUARD reaches the bottom of the STEPS and hoists 
           the CASKET on top of the CAISSON, for its final journey.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CAROLINE KENNEDY’S BEDROOM

                                 JACKIE
                        Happy birthday, little boy.

           Off their embrace, we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - DAY

           A line of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and POLICE OFFICERS trotting 
           out of the WHITE HOUSE GATES, taking up positions every 10 
           feet in front of the already waiting mourners...

           We ANGLE ON on one AGENT, who, seeing the size of the crowd, 
           turns to his colleague...

                                 AGENT
                        We’d better get lucky today.  This 
                        is out of control.

           Off that colleague’s nervous nod, we...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. UNITED STATES CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

           The DRUM MAJOR of the MARINE BAND brings down his baton and 
           the CAISSON rolls forward, to the sound of “Our Fallen 
           Heroes,” as we...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PORTICO - DAY

           ...the CAISSON coming to a stop in front of the WHITE HOUSE.  

           We ANGLE UP to see JACKIE peering out at the assembled crowd.

           Now JACKIE’S POV... as she looks out at BOBBY and ETHEL. TED 
           KENNEDY and his wife JOAN. JANET and HUGH AUCHINCLOSS.  
           SHRIVER and his wife EUNICE. 

           PRESIDENT and LADY BIRD JOHNSON.  

           MCNAMARA and his wife MARGARET.  Aides O’BRIEN, O’DONNELL, 
           and POWERS. 

           Behind them is a pantheon of foreign leaders.  DE GAULLE, 
           EMPEROR HAILE SELASSIE of Ethiopia, PRINCE PHILLIP, DUKE OF 
           EDINBURGH, SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTER ANASTAS MIKOYAN, JEAN 
           MONNET and others.

           It is an extraordinary gathering.  JACKIE steps to the front 
           of the group and takes her place between BOBBY and TED.  She 
           lowers her BLACK VEIL over her face, and the BLACK WATCH 
           PIPERS their plaintive dirge...

           The CAISSON, pulled forth by a train of WHITE STALLIONS, 
           rolls forward and the grim parade begins...

           As they exit the WHITE HOUSE GATES, JACKIE looks down 
           PENNSYLVANIA and for the first time comes face-to-face with 
           the scope of the nation’s sorrow.  All the way to the distant 
           horizon, the sidewalks are overflowing with MOURNERS.  

           JACKIE pauses and we ANGLE ON... HILL, tensing up beside her.  
           He scans the crowd for threats as POLICE OFFICERS on the rope 
           line similarly snap to attention.

           We ANGLE WIDE, and see the long, empty street ahead.  

           A series of CLOSE-UPS... on a MAN IN A FEDORA.  A BLACK MAN.  
           A WOMAN and CHILD.  Threats?  Or grieving citizens?   

           JACKIE takes a step and continues bravely marching forward, 
           as the BAGPIPES now completely fill the silence.
           As she walks we INTERCUT the walk to SAINT MATTHEWS with...

           INT. SAINT MATTHEWS CATHEDRAL

           The FUNERAL OF JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY.  CLOSE-UP of the 
           PULPIT and the AUXILIARY BISHOP of Washington, PHILLIP 
           HANNAN, reading from KENNEDY’S Innaugural Address...

                                 BISHOP HANNAN
                        We observe today not a victory of 
                        party, but a celebration of 
                        freedom, symbolizing an end as well 
                        as a beginning, signifying renewal 
                        as well as change.  Let the word go 
                        forth from this time and place, to 
                        friend and foe alike, the the torch 
                        has been passed to a new generation 
                        of Americans...

           JACKIE leads the procession, turning off PENNSYLVANIA AVE and 
           onto 17th street.  She is erect, regal, poised.

                                 BISHOP HANNAN (CONT’D)
                        Now the trumpet summons us again -- 
                        not as a call to bear arms, though 
                        arms we need; not as a call to 
                        battle, though embattled we are; 
                        but a call to bear the burden of a 
                        long twilight struggle...

           JACKIE leads the procession off 17th and onto CONNECTICUT 
           AVE, eyes ahead, unwavering.

                                 BISHOP HANNAN (CONT’D)
                        And so my fellow Americans, ask not 
                        what your country can do for you; 
                        ask what you can do for your 
                        country.  

           JACKIE arrives at the entrance to SAINT MATTHEWS, and as the 
           CASKET is carried inside...

                                 BISHOP HANNAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        With a good conscience our only 
                        sure reward, with history the final 
                        judge of our deeds, let us go forth 
                        to lead the land we love, asking 
                        His blessing and his Help, but 
                        knowing that here on earth, God’s 
                        work must truly be our own. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SAINT MATTHEWS CATHEDRAL

           ANGLE ON... JACKIE, as BISHOP HANNAN collects his notes and 
           steps down from the pulpit.  CARDINAL CUSHING stands before 
           the CASKET.  In anguish...

                                 CARDINAL CUSHING
                        May the angels, dear Jack, lead you 
                        into Paradise.  May the martyrs 
                        receive you at your coming.

           JACKIE lets out a terrible SOB.  A TINY HAND enters the 
           frame, and we see CAROLINE, sitting beside her.

                                 CAROLINE
                        You’ll be alright, Mommy.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAINT MATTHEWS CATHEDRAL - DAY

           The CONGREGANTS stream out of the CATHEDRAL and crowd the 
           steps behind JACKIE, flanked  by JOHN JR and CAROLINE.  The 
           CASKET is back on the CAISSON, for the final leg of its 
           journey. 

           The MARINE BAND strikes the opening chord of “Hail to the 
           Chief” and every SOLDIER and POLICEMAN snap to attention.

           JACKIE leans down to JOHN JR.

                                 JACKIE
                             (whisper)
                        You can salute Daddy now and say 
                        goodbye.

           JOHN JR raises his right hand to his forehead, as we...

           A CAMERA’S POV... on that very same image of the saluting 
           child, now in BLACK & WHITE, as broadcast to every living 
           room in America.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - JACKIE’S BEDROOM

           ...JACKIE standing, alone, looking out the window, as the sun 
           sets over the WHITE HOUSE lawn.
           Below her, in the drive, a MOVING VAN has backed up to the 
           WEST WING, emptying it of her husband’s belongings.

           ANGLE ON... A MOVER, carrying the President’s ROCKING CHAIR, 
           just one more piece of furniture being discarded.

           JACKIE bows her head, exhausted.

           A KNOCK, and MARY enters... 

                                 MARY
                        Mrs. Kennedy?

                                 JACKIE
                        Yes?

                                 MARY
                        The First Lady -- I mean Mrs. 
                        Johnson -- wishes to know if you’ll 
                        join her for breakfast in the 
                        morning?

                                 JACKIE
                        Tell the First Lady, I’m simply too 
                        exhausted.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - JACKIE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           JACKIE lies in bed, sleepless and tormented.  She grabs the 
           phone at her bedside and dials...

                                 JACKIE
                             (into phone)
                        Bobby?..  I need to go see him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

           A single LIMOUSINE winding through the vacant streets, past 
           the WASHINGTON MONUMENT and the JEFFERSON MEMORIAL...

           ...through the gates of ARLINGTON CEMETERY.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - NIGHT

           The LIMOUSINE comes to a stop on the hill overlooking the 
           newly lit ETERNAL FLAME, and the fresh GRAVE beneath it.   

           JACKIE races down the hill, BOBBY following closely behind 
           her.

           JACKIE stops at the GRAVE and notices...

           A GREEN BERET.  A BLACK AND WHITE BRASSARD.  A BUFF STRAP and 
           OLD GUARD COCKADE.  Tributes from soldiers. 

           BOBBY now stands beside her.

                                 BOBBY
                        He would have been so proud of you 
                        today.

                                 JACKIE
                        I told him... After Patrick... That 
                        there was one thing I couldn’t 
                        stand.  

           BOBBY is silent.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s ironic.  Losing that child.  I  
                        don’t think Jack and I had ever 
                        been closer. The way he doted on 
                        me.  I thought...

           She trails off.

                                 BOBBY
                        He loved you.  You have to know 
                        that.

                                 JACKIE
                        Before Texas, he asked me what I 
                        planned to wear.  He’d never asked 
                        me that before.  Said I should show 
                        those high-society gals what good 
                        taste looked like.

                                 BOBBY
                        He was so grateful you were coming.  
                        The day we announced it to the 
                        papers, you were the front-page 
                        headline.  
                                 JACKIE
                        When we were engaged, he asked me 
                        to translate this French book about 
                        Indo-China. For a speech he was 
                        giving in the Senate.  I remember 
                        feeling so flattered.
                             (beat)
                        But, it all got so complicated, and 
                        big, and at some point I just felt 
                        like I was watching.  Watching Jack 
                        and you trying to conquer the 
                        world.

           JACKIE stares the FLAME, flickering in the black void.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        He wanted to do so much.  And this 
                        is what we’re left with? 

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s not over.

                                 JACKIE
                        It’s not?  

                                 BOBBY
                        Not for me, or Larry or Kenny -- 

                                 JACKIE
                        Jack’s gone.  He’s gone!  And I 
                        can’t stay in that goddamn house 
                        another minute!

                                 BOBBY
                        Then go to the Cape.  I’ll be here 
                        to fight.  For Civil rights. For 
                        the moon.  Those were Jack’s dreams 
                        and I promise you Jackie... I’ll 
                        never let anyone forget it.

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh, Bobby.  How can you?  You and 
                        Jack... You’re both the same.  You 
                        think I don’t know how the world 
                        works?  All those men today, 
                        marching in that parade... Today 
                        they wept for him, and tonight 
                        they’re lining up to serve Lyndon.  

           BOBBY has no more left in him.

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s been a long day.  We’re both 
                        exhausted. 
           BOBBY kneels and crosses himself. As he prays, we ANGLE WIDE 
           on the two lonely figures. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE

           The next morning, the OVAL OFFICE is hardly recognizable.  
           The SCARLET carpet remains, but little else.  All the 
           FURNITURE has been replaced, and PRESIDENT JOHNSON sits 
           behind his new DESK. 

           He rises as JACKIE walks in to greet him.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Oh, sweetie, how are you doing?

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m fine, Mr. President.  Thank you 
                        for asking.

           JOHNSON gestures to the couches...

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Have a seat?

                                 JACKIE
                        No, thank you.  I know you must 
                        busy.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Please, I --

                                 JACKIE
                        I’ve just come to tell you, that 
                        the children and I plan to move out 
                        immediately.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Now, that’s not necessary.  Lady 
                        Bird and I want you to take all the 
                        time you need.

                                 JACKIE
                        I appreciate that, but, to be 
                        honest, I can’t stand to be here a 
                        moment longer.  We leave for the 
                        Cape tonight.  Nancy will supervise 
                        the move in my absence. 

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        If there’s anything we can do...
                                 JACKIE
                        I want to thank you. For walking 
                        yesterday behind Jack.  You didn’t 
                        have to do that -- I’m sure many 
                        people forbid you to take such a 
                        risk -- but you did it anyway.  
                             (beat)
                        And I want you to thank you for 
                        always being so kind to me and my 
                        children.

           JOHNSON is moved.

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        Lady Bird and I... Well, this town, 
                        it doesn’t bring out the best in 
                        people.  And you always treated us 
                        like human beings.  We’ll never 
                        forget that.

           JACKIE hugs JOHNSON as we...

           LIMOUSINE, as the last of their luggage is loaded behind 
           them...

           JACKIE takes a final look back at her home as we...

           WALTON mounting a plaque outside JACKIE’S bedroom.  We ANGLE 
           IN and it reads:

           Jaqueline, during the two years, ten months, and two days he 
           was President of the United States: January 20, 1961 - 
           November 22, 1963.”

           We ANGLE OUT... and see the bedroom is EMPTY, as we...

                        I’ll be out of your way in just a 
                        minute.

                                 VALENTI
                             (sincere)
                        I’m sorry.  They told me you’d 
                        left.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        You must be relieved.  That it’s 
                        all over.

                                 VALENTI
                        It’ll never be over, Larry.  The 
                        country will be grieving for a long 
                        time.  I wish I had that luxury, 
                        but I look around, and -- well, 
                        there’s just so much work that 
                        needs doing.

           O’BRIEN moves out from behind the desk and walks toward the 
           door.  VALENTI reaches out to stop him.

                                 VALENTI (CONT’D)
                        These past few days... I probably 
                        haven’t said it enough.  I’m so 
                        sorry for your loss.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 VALENTI (CONT’D)
                        For what we’ve all lost.
                             (beat)
                        I know we’ll never fill his shoes.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        He’d want you to try.
                             (beat)
                        Good luck, Jack.  We’ll all be 
                        pulling for you.

           O’BRIEN exits for the last time.

           JACKIE, POWERS, and PAT, sit on the couch.  JACKIE smokes, 
           and POWERS nurses a drink. 

           ANGLE ON a TELEVISION in the corner of the room, broadcasting 
           a Joint Session of Congress...  

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                             (on television)
                        John F. Kennedy told his 
                        countrymen, "let us begin." Today, 
                        in this moment of new resolve, I 
                        would say to all my fellow 
                        Americans, let us continue.

           under gray skies before her... 

                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        I urge you again, as I did in 1957 
                        and again in 1960, to enact a civil 
                        rights law so that we can move 
                        forward to eliminate from this 
                        Nation every trace of 
                        discrimination and oppression that 
                        is based upon race or color. 

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - KITCHEN

           JACKIE sits at the TABLE with PAT, while POWERS pours them 
           coffee. PAT and POWERS laugh at some shared joke, but JACKIE 
           is lost and silent...
                                 PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                        In short, this is no time for 
                        delay. It is a time for action--
                        strong, forward-looking action on 
                        the pending education bills to help 
                        bring the light of learning to

                        youth employment opportunities;

                        We meet in grief, but let us also 
                        meet in renewed dedication and 
                        renewed vigor. Let us meet in

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM

           JACKIE sits on the couch, that storm now raging outside.  She 
           picks up the PHONE beside her.

                                 JACKIE
                             (into phone)
                        Dave?... I need to speak to 
                        Theodore White please... No, 
                        tonight.  As soon as possible.

           overflowing with butts.  WHITE is on the last pages of his 
           NOTEBOOK.  He finishes writing and shakes out his hand.  He’s 
           been at it for hours.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m sorry.  I hope I haven’t 
                        exhausted you.

                                 WHITE
                        Not at all.

                                 JACKIE
                        It’s just... I know that fairly 
                        soon... no one will be listening.

                                 WHITE
                        These past few days, Mrs. 
                        Kennedy... You’ve made a mark on 
                        this country.

                                 JACKIE
                        Perhaps.  But what have people 
                        really seen?  How will they think 
                        of it all?  

                                 WHITE
                        No one can shake the horror of 
                        Dallas.  It’s all people can talk 
                        about.

                                 JACKIE
                        But that’s all so trivial.  All 
                        this speculation about Oswald. It’s 
                        beside the point.

                                 WHITE
                        My editors tell me 95% of Americans 
                        watched the funeral from start to 
                        finish.  Your dignity.  The majesty 
                        of it all.  Decades from now -- 
                        You’ve set a standard. 

           JACKIE seems dissatisfied by his answer.
                                 JACKIE
                        There’s one last thing I need to 
                        say.  It’s more important than all 
                        the rest.

                                 WHITE
                        Of course, Mrs. Kennedy.

                                 JACKIE
                        At night, before going to bed, we 
                        had an old Victrola.  We’d play a 
                        couple records.  And his favorite 
                        was “Camelot”.

                                 WHITE
                        The musical?

                                 JACKIE
                             (laughing to herself)
                        I’m so ashamed of myself.  
                        Everything Jack ever quoted was 
                        Greek or Roman.  But it’s the last 
                        song, the last side of “Camelot” 
                        that keeps running through my head.
                             (beat)
                        “Don’t let it be forgot, that for 
                        one brief shining moment there was 
                        a Camelot.”

                                 WHITE
                        And why do you think he loved that 
                        song?

                                 JACKIE
                        Jack loved history so.  It made him 
                        what he was.  Imagine him... this 
                        little boy, in bed with scarlet 
                        fever. He was reading history. The 
                        Knights of the Round Table.  More 
                        than any other man I’ve ever known, 
                        he saw heroes where others saw mere 
                        mortals. 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t misunderstand... Jack wasn’t 
                        naive.  But, he had ideals.  Ideals 
                        he could rally others to believe 
                        in.

                                 WHITE
                        You must have some faith... that 
                        those ideals will live on?
                                 JACKIE
                        Of course there will be progress.  
                        And there will be other great 
                        Presidents.  The Johnson’s have 
                        been so generous to me.  
                             (beat)
                        But there won’t be another Camelot, 
                        Mr. White.  Not another Camelot...

                             (into phone)
                        It’s me... I know... Have they held 
                        open the pages?  Ok, then, let’s 
                        stop bickering then and get to 
                        it... 

           We INTERCUT WHITE dictating his article -- JACKIE never 
           leaving his side -- with...

           Slowly, we PULL WIDE and see two fresh graves have been dug 
           beside it.  They are smaller than usual...

                        the night they tried to separate 
                        him from her, to sedate her, to 
                        take care of her -- and she would 
                        not let them...

                        She had given him a St. 
                        Christopher’s medal when they were 
                        married; but when Patrick died this 
                        summer, they had wanted to put 
                        something in the coffin with 
                        Patrick that was from them both; 
                        and so he had put in the St. 
                        Christopher’s medal.

           The tiny CASKETS come to a rest in their graves, and we swing

                        As for herself, she was horrified 
                        by the stories that she might live 
                        abroad.  ‘That’s a desecration.  
                        I’m going to live int he places I 
                        live with Jack.’ 

           CLOSE-UP on JACKIE...

                                 WHITE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        She does not want them to forget 
                        John F. Kennedy or read of him only 
                        in dusty or bitter histories:  For 
                        one brief shining moment there was

                                                            OVER BLACK:

           During those four endless days in 1963, she held us together 
           as a family and a country.  In large part because of her, we 
           could grieve and then go on.  She lifted us up, and in the 
           doubt and darkness, she gave her fellow citizens back their 
           pride as Americans.  She was then 34 years old.
