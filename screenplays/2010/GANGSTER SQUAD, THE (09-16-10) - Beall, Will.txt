           Coyotes prowl the dark, pacing back and forth, agitated. 

                                 COHEN (V.O.)
                        LA’s virgin territory... 

           EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - SUMMER EVENING

                                 COHEN (V.O.)
                        Everything’s wide open out here.

           New cars in the driveways of new ‘ranch’ homes. PARENTS 
           on porches, watering lawns. CHILDREN on roller skates and 
           bikes, chasing the last light of day. Children scatter 
           from two CARS tearing through the idyllic neighborhood. 

           Coyotes bold with hunger. Mouths open in demonic grins.

           Cohen’s GOONS in a CHEVY pursuing MEN in a CADDY, firing 
           at them. Screeching tires. Screams. A TRICYCLE overturned 
           in the street, wheel spinning.  

                                 COHEN (V.O.)
                        Nothin’ here but a coupla redskins 
                        runnin’ some chickenshit rackets.

           The chase continues down the block, the street giving way 
           to graded lots, surveyors stakes, and the subdivision’s 
           hedge-lined wooden BILLBOARD along the highway displaying 
           an All-American nuclear family. OWN A PIECE OF PARADISE! 

           The coyotes’ eyes glow in the night like abalone coins.

           Cohen’s goons FIRE into the Caddy, the driver slumps, the 
           Caddy swerving up over a berm, SMASHING into the 
           billboard, BURSTING INTO FLAMES. Panicked people running 
           out into the street, watching the fire climb the 
           billboard, consuming the painted family...

                                 COHEN (V.O.)
                        And out here, I’m Cortez. 

           INT. SLAPSY MAXIE’S NIGHTCLUB (COHEN’S TABLE) - NIGHT

           MICKEY COHEN (36) eating ROAST PEACOCK, talking between 
           bites. He’s not a large man, but his malevolence fills a 
           room, fills your lungs like poison gas. Like you could 
           almost choke to death just standing next to him.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 COHEN
                        I’m somethin’ they’ve never seen 
                        before.

                                 RAGAN
                        You been out in the sun too long.

           Opposite Cohen is JAMES RAGAN (50s) Chicago Gangster who 
           operates the Continental Wire Service. Ragan’s brought 
           his own muscle, a professional killer named ROURKE.

           Next to Cohen is KARL LENNOX, a Kodiak with a crewcut, 
           Cohen’s bodyguard and Grand High Executioner. *Frazetta’s 
           Death Dealer in a fedora. He’s a former state trooper. 
           Cohen leans over to pull a Remington M1911 .45 from the 
           shoulder holster in Lennox’s coat. If Ragan’s frightened 
           by the .45 in Cohen’s hand, he doesn’t show it. Ice cold. 

                                 COHEN
                        You know for my money a 
                        Remington’s still the best Roscoe 
                        on the market. Simple. Reliable.
                        Blow a tunnel in ‘em a kid could 
                        drive his toy train through. 

           Expertly locking back the slide, stripping out the mag. 

                                 COHEN
                        What’s Remington makin’ now? 
                        Universal Automatic Computers. 
                        Adding machines that store 
                        information in vacuum tubes. 

           Ragan watches Cohen disassembling the finely-machined 
           pistol, laying out its components with total mastery.

                                 COHEN
                        See, now I got all the guns I 
                        need. But information, that’s the 
                        future of our business. 
                                 (beat)
                        Your Continental Wire and Trans 
                        America are competin’ with each 
                        other. It’s a goddamned waste. 

           Cohen reassembles the gun. In this hands, the components 
           almost leap back together, as though eager to please him.

                                 COHEN
                        But you combine them, consolidate 
                        them? You’d have one wire feedin’ 
                        us all the information. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 RAGAN
                        A wire that you’d control.

                                 COHEN
                        Your taste alone would be twice 
                        what your wire takes in now.

                                 RAGAN
                        Yeah. You know, Capone tried to 
                        muscle me. Ten years ago. I’ve 
                        seen the sour end of a gun before, 
                        kid. More times than you been 
                        laid. And I ain’t impressed. 

           Ragan stands to leave. Something flickers behind Cohen’s 
           eyes, something stalking behind the bars of its cage. 

                                                              HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Coyotes KEEN and CRY, circling like lion-colored sharks 
           in the shadow of the HOLLYWOOD SIGN. Overlooking LA. 

                                 COHEN
                                 (doing Bela Lugosi)
                        The cheeldren of the night. What 
                        music they make... 

           Two CADILLACS facing opposite directions, engines 
           REVVING. Their Taillights form a huge red clover in the 
           dirt, where RAGAN lies between the two cars, chained to 
           their rear bumpers. Ragan’s about to be pulled apart.

           Lennox has his gun in Rourke’s ribs. Cohen’s GOONS form a 
           loose circle around Ragan. An impatient coyote darts in 
           for a bite but one of Cohen’s goons kicks at it and it 
           circles beyond his reach. He picks up a rock and throws 
           it, scattering them. But the coyotes come right back.

                                 COHEN
                                 (re: coyotes)
                        It’s the damnedest thing, Jimmy. 
                        You know I been up here so many 
                        times now they got this...

           Searching for the term, Cohen turns to Lennox.

                                 LENNOX
                        Pavlovian response.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 COHEN
                        Yeah, they see me up here and they 
                        know they’re gettin’ a treat.

                                 RAGAN
                        You’re a sick twist, Mickey.

                                 COHEN
                                 (laughing)
                        You were beggin’ me a minute ago.

                                 RAGAN
                        That’s when I thought you were 
                        human. But you’re somethin’ else. 
                        Somethin’ rotten.

           Cohen nods. The CARS drive in opposite directions, 
           pulling the chains taut between them. Ragan SCREAMS. 
           Wheels spin, spitting dust until some crucial part of him 
           gives way. *We don’t actually see Ragan torn in half. But 
           Cohen does, and it delights him. The cars drive apart. 
           The coyotes move in.

                                 COHEN
                        You’re impressed now, aren’t you, 
                        you son of a bitch.

           Lennox steers Rourke’s head, forcing him to watch the 
           scrum of coyotes snarling and snapping in a cloud of 
           dust, fighting over what’s left of Ragan. Rourke vomits.

                                 COHEN
                                 (to Rourke)
                        The rest of your life. Every 
                        breath you take from now on is a 
                        gift from me. Understand?

           Rourke nods furiously. He’s in shock. 

                                 COHEN
                        Now, I want you to go back to 
                        Chicago and tell ‘em what you’ve 
                        seen here. You tell ‘em Los 
                        Angeles belongs to Mickey Cohen.

           A milk-skinned BLONDE (18) watching the UNION STATION 
           PLATFORM flow to a stop outside her window. She’s a 
           harvest festival princess from Nowhere, USA, a cautionary 
           tale, stepping like *Dorothy into Oz out into... 
           EXT. UNION STATION PLATFORM - SUNSET

           LOS ANGELES: Realm of Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain. 
           At once a glittering city of lotus-eaters and a sprawling 
           boomtown of the quick and the dead. Fedoras. French hats. 
           Furs and pinstripes. Postwar optimism. Predation. Peril.  

                                     LOS ANGELES 1949

           INT. UNION STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           The vulpine MITCH RACINE (28) watches WOMEN passing 
           through Union Station the way a croc watches toddlers 
           wade the Ganges. Racine sidles to our blonde, smiles. 

                                 O’MARA (O.S.)
                        The better to eat you with.

           From across the station, two plainclothes LAPD DETECTIVES 
           slyly scope Racine handing our blonde his BUSINESS CARD. 

           SGT. JOHN O’MARA (30s): A thousand yard stare shaded by 
           his fedora. Military brush cut. A square jaw you’d break 
           your knuckles on. When George S Patton said “A hasty plan 
           violently executed is better than a perfect plan next 
           week,” he was talking about O’Mara. He gets it done. He 
           lives in a bicameral world where there is good and there 
           is evil. Killed his share of Krauts. Didn’t enjoy it. 
           Didn’t lose sleep over it. Doesn’t give his word lightly. 
           But he’ll die to keep it. A trained commando who fights 
           like a Viking bezerker. Fuck with him at your peril.

           O’Mara’s partner, DETECTIVE SGT. WILL HENDRICKS(30s) is 
           softer, sadder. He was 4-F, stayed behind while his 
           buddies went off to save the world. He’s nobody’s hero.

                                 HENDRICKS
                        You figure his card says MITCH 
                        RACINE: PIMP AND BLACK DAHLIA 
                        SUSPECT?

           But our blonde looks like she can’t believe her luck. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Looks more like MITCH RACINE: 
                        TALENT AGENT to me.

           EXT. THE CROESUS BUILDING - NIGHT

           Racine pulls her suitcase out of a CAB, and squires our 
           blonde into the 10-story beaux-arts CROESUS BUILDING. 
           INT. O’MARA’S PLAIN DETECTIVE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The moment they pull up to the Croesus, Hendricks turns 
           white, like they’ve crossed into a minefield. Hendricks 
           watches in horror as O’Mara keys the mic on the radio.

                                 O’MARA (INTO RADIO)
                        William 60. We’re Code 6 at the

                        The hell are you doing?

                                 O’MARA
                        What does it look like? He’s gonna 
                        give her a bad time in there.

                        Everybody knows about this place. 
                        It’s like an Indian burial ground. 
                        Nobody’s comin’ anywhere near it. 

                                 O’MARA
                        So what? We’re just supposed to 
                        let ‘em dry-gulch the poor kid? 

                                 HENDRICKS
                        Don’t pull any of your Captain 
                        Midnight crap, Sarge. Not here.

           O’Mara pulls his .38 REVOLVER, wrist-flicks the cylinder. 

                                 HENDRICKS
                        I don’t want any part of this.

                                 O’MARA
                        Then stay out of my way.
           INT. CROESUS LOBBY - SECONDS LATER

           O’Mara walks in alone. 4 THUGS by the elevator look him 
           over as the IRON DIAL above the elevator cage STOPS at 9. 

           INT. 9TH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Racine and our blonde step from the elevator to head down 
           the hallway. Mounting dread. All the doors PADLOCKED. 

                                 RACINE
                        We hold all our screen tests up

           INT. CROESUS LOBBY - NIGHT

           The BRUISER behind the BELL DESK seems to sniff O’Mara, 
           his hand caressing a .45, unseen behind his desk.

                                 O’MARA
                        I’m here to meet someone.

                                 BRUISER
                        Yeah? What’s her name? 

           O’Mara smiles playfully, just looking for a good time.

                                 O’MARA
                        I don’t know yet. I was hoping 
                        maybe you could help me with that.

                                 THUG 1
                        We got a someone or two upstairs. 
                        Come on. I’ll introduce you.

           INT. 9TH FLOOR ROOM - NIGHT

           Racine knocks on the door. It opens on THREE THUGS around 
           a table. Whiskey and cards. Eyeing her like a rare steak. 

                                 BLONDE
                        Thanks, Mister. Really. But I 
                        changed my mind-

           -wincing Oww! as Racine vice-clamps her tricep. 
           INT. CAGE ELEVATOR (ASCENDING) - NIGHT

           O’Mara riding up with FOUR THUGS. Brawlers with scars, 
           cauliflower ears. The elevator’s cramped. Tension mounts.

                                 O’MARA
                        I mention I’m partial to blondes?

           He smiles awkwardly at Thug 1, and WINCES as Thug 2 JABS 
           the business end of a PISTOL into O’Mara’s kidney. 

                                 THUG 1
                        Alright, big guy. 
                                 (snapping fingers)
                        Pistola. Butt-first. Or my buddy 
                        burns one through your back porch. 

           O’Mara reaches INSIDE HIS COAT. O’Mara’s unseen hand 
           closing around the .38 in his shoulder holster. 

                                 THUG 2
                        Nice and easy there, Dutch.

           Thug 1 glimpses the BADGE on his belt. 

                                 THUG 1 
                        You’re a cop? Christ, buddy, you 
                        soft in the head or something?

           O’Mara HEAD-BUTTS Thug 1, and simultaneously FIRES BACK 
           under his left arm. BLAM! The bullet PUNCHES out through 
           the back of his coat to hit THUG 2 below his collar bone. 
           Thug 2 drops his pistol. O’Mara kicks it away, the gat 
           clanking as it tumbles down the elevator shaft. O’Mara 
           brings his .38 out of his coat, but Thug 1 SEIZES his 
           wrist, the gun firing wildly through the floor- 

           INT. 9TH FLOOR ROOM - NIGHT

           -Racine bear-hugs her. She STOMPS on his shoe, writhes 
           away, but Thug 3 catches her, tearing her blouse. Racine 
           SLAPS her! They hold her. MURPHY BED draw-bridging down- 

           INT. CAGE ELEVATOR STILL ASCENDING - NIGHT

           -O’Mara’s commando training kicks in and he serves them 
           up some Jiu Jitsu he picked up overseas: blurring FISTS, 
           ELBOWS, vicious throat-CHOPS! Not balletic, brutal.

                                 THUG 1
                        How the hell did you-

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Thug 1 is raising his gun, but O’Mara traps his arm, 
           FORCING his arm OUT the bars of the cage. The 9th FLOOR 
           comes DOWN past the rising elevator like a guillotine- -
           BREAKING the thug’s arm! GYAAAH! His gun clanging away 
           down the shaft. 

           O’Mara exits the elevator, running down the hall, 
           following her SCREAMS. 

           INT. 9TH FLOOR ROOM - NIGHT

           She SCREAMS, struggling on the bed while Thugs 5 & 6 hold 
           her down. Knock! Knock! Racine opens a gleaming STRAIGHT 
           RAZOR. Her terrified eyes reflected in the blade face. 

                                 RACINE
                        Make another sound and you’re 
                        dead.

           She nods, frozen, as they FOLD the Murphy back up into 
           the wall with her captured inside it. Knock! Knock! 

           Racine opens the door and meets O’Mara’s FIST. Racine 
           CRASHING back into a table. O’Mara follows him in, hand 
           jammed in his coat pocket, hoping it LOOKS LIKE A GUN. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Mitts in the air. All of you.

           Racine narrows his eyes at O’Mara, smelling bullshit.

                                 RACINE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think so ... Ten bucks 
                        says this guy ain’t even heeled. 

                            THUG 3
                                                         THUG 4
           You got a bet.
                                              Yeah, I’ll take some of 
                                              that.

           A tense moment. O’Mara’s bluff holding by a thread.

                                 O’MARA
                        Come on over and find out.

           Racine makes his move, stepping toward O’Mara, grinning 
           now. Holding his straight razor behind his leg. O’Mara 
           pulls his finger out of his coat, points it at Racine. 

                                 O’MARA (CONT’D)
                        Bang.
           INT. MURPHY BED - CONTINUOUS

           In the darkness BEHIND the Murphy bed, our Blonde hears 
           FURNITURE BREAKING. FISTS POUNDING. GROWLS of BRUTALITY.  

           INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Murphy bed OPENS. Shattered furniture. Thugs moaning. 
           Sgt. John O’Mara is the last man standing. Panting, he 
           shows the girl his BADGE to let her know she’s safe. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Welcome to Los Angeles.

           I/E. SLAPSY MAXIE’S NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Klieg lights. Limousines under the portico. Neon: SLAPSY 
           MAXIE’S. A long line of REVELERS waiting to get in the 
           door. SGT. JERRY WOOTERS (30s) BADGES the DOORMAN, walks 
           right to the front of the line. Near the entrance, PETE, 
           13 going on 33, living on wits and moxie, is shining a 
           GUY’s shoes. Pete looks up as Wooters passes him.  

                                 PETE
                        He’s in there now.

                                 WOOTERS
                                 (tossing two bits)
                        Thanks, Pete.

           Wooters waltzes into the club like Fred Astaire. He 
           doesn’t look like a cop, doesn’t move like one, or think 
           like one. Hair pomade-slick, a month long. He’s a bon 
           vivant, never met a woman or wager he didn’t like, 
           serious about bachelorhood and little else. 

           Wooters glides upstream past swift WAITERS, CIGARETTE 
           GIRLS who give him the eye. He loves the action. Black-
           seamed stockings. BARBARA STANWYCK, BOGART, BACALL. 
           Everything the traffic will allow.

           At the MIC, his black tie hanging loose, DEAN MARTIN 
           sings ‘BRAZIL’ backed by XAVIER CUGAT’s ORCHESTRA. JERRY 
           LEWIS cavorts in a headdress next to LINA ROMAY.

           Wooters finds shylock JACK WHALEN at his regular table. 
           Whalen’s a cornfed bruiser, Jethro Bodine meets the Hulk. 
           He’s eating a steak, washing it down with whiskey.

                        your arrest. 

                                 WHALEN
                        What’s the charge?

                                 WOOTERS
                        Usury.

                        The hell is usury?

                                 WOOTERS
                        Loan sharking, dumbass. You going 
                        to come along quietly?

                                 WHALEN
                        Cousin, I never done anything 
                        quietly in my life. I surely don’t 
                        aim to start now. 

           A stare-down, cop to crook, but neither man can keep a 
           straight face. And they both break out laughing.

                                 WHALEN
                        Take a pew, Brother Jerry. Steak a-
                        la-cart-e here ain’t exactly 
                        pizen. 

           The waiter brings Wooters a steak and whiskey, unbidden.

                                 WHALEN
                        I booked you an appointment to 
                        raid the Cabana Club. Same as the 
                        others. Dragna says you can round 
                        up the usual suspects. Just don’t 
                        pinch his people or damage his 
                        machines.

                        Jimmy Ragan’s gone to his reward.
                        Smoke says Cohen’s on the warpath. 

           Wooters nods inquisitively toward MICKEY COHEN at his 
           table by the stage, his Praetorian Guard in evidence, 
           Cohen’s coterie of SYCOPHANTS around him, paying tribute.

                        right, we’ve got the honorable 
                        Judge Krauss, Max Solomon, Burbank 
                        Police Chief Elmer Jackson, and 
                        one Eugene W. Biscailuz, the high 
                        Sheriff of Los Ang-ell-eez County.

                        Shame. What kind of cop would 
                        break bread with a criminal?

           INT. COHEN’S TABLE AT SLAPSY MAXIE’S - CONTINUOUS

           Cohen preaching his gospel to JUDGE KRAUSS, SHERIFF 
           BISCAILUZ, ELMER JACKSON. Fear and greed in their eyes.

                                 COHEN
                        See, people won’t have to drag 
                        their asses out to the track 
                        anymore. The wire brings all the 
                        action to them. Up to the minute 
                        odds, right into their 
                        neighborhoods. And in a few more 
                        years, I won’t even need the damn 
                        wire. They got television signals.

                        What about Dragna?

           Cohen’s obsidian eyes, the eyes of a predator.

                                 COHEN
                        I wouldn’t worry about him.

           Next to Cohen JEAN FARADAY rolls her eyes, a GI pinup by 
           Alberto Vargas. World-weary, and effortlessly sexy.

           A WAITER rushing through the CROWD, carrying a HOUSE 
           PHONE trailing a long cord, across the club to Cohen.

                                 (into receiver)
                        Speak.

           After a moment, Cohen hangs up, turning to JUDGE KRAUSS, 
           whispering something to him.

                                 KRAUSS
                        Of course. I’ll take care of it.

           Krauss lifts an oyster, sucks flesh off the shell, like a 
           reptile. Krauss’ eyes all over Jean.

                                 JEAN
                                 (to Cohen)
                        I thought I told you to keep that 
                        rotten creep away from me.

                                 COHEN
                        Hey. Be nice, huh?

           She gets up and storms off. Krauss watching her go.

           INT. SLAPSY MAXIE’S - CONTINUOUS

           Wooters spots JEAN crossing the room. Her dress could 
           stand up by itself. Legs about 40 feet long. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Doesn’t seem right, you know, that 
                        he should have so much, when 
                        others have so few. 

                                 WHALEN
                        You sound like a pink pamphlet, 
                        pal, but this ain’t Russia. It’s

                        Well, yeah. But I’m starving.

           AT THE BAR: Jean sees Wooters coming, but doesn’t let on. 
           She opens her cigarette case, plucks out an Old Gold as 
           he arrives, lifting his U.S. NAVY ZIPPO to her Cigarette. 
           She closes her hand over his, bringing his flame closer.

                                 JEAN
                        Say Jerry, I’ll just bet you have 
                        a ducky war story behind that 
                        lighter. Come on, I thought all 
                        you guys had war stories to make a 
                        girl go weak in the knees.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Hmm. Well, we were shot down once. 
                        Spent a day and a half floating in 
                        the Pacific, sharks circling us. 
                        And some of ‘em? Bigger than the 
                        raft. You could feel them brushing 
                        up against it in the dark. 

                                 JEAN
                        Ooh. Don’t tell me. You dove in 
                        with your knife between your teeth 
                        and fought them off like Johnny 
                        Weissmuller - who’s right over 
                        there by the way.

                                 WOOTERS
                        No, what I did? I bet my buddies a 
                        rescue plane would get to us 
                        before the sharks did. I took them 
                        for a hundred bucks a piece. Are 
                        you weak in the knees yet?

                                 JEAN
                                 (exhaling smoke)
                        Sure I am. Let’s see. You’re not 
                        quite big enough to be a shylock. 
                        So what’s your racket, handsome? 

                                 WOOTERS
                        I’m a Bible salesman.

                        take you to bed.

           INT. CROESUS HALLWAYS - NIGHT

           The aftermath of O’Mara’s battle: O’Mara moves down the 
           dark halls, AXES the heavy PADLOCKS off the DOORS. And 
           the DOORS SWING OPEN, one after another, to reveal..

           Young WOMEN: Vacant-eyed, pale. NEEDLE-MARKED ARMS, 
           struggling on stained mattresses, bound to bed frames. 
           Turning their heads in shame as O’Mara cuts them loose.

           I/E. STAFF 1 (CHIEF PARKER’S CAR) - NIGHT

           STAFF 1, the Chief’s unmarked, bullet-resistant BUICK 
           DYNAFLOW smoothly negotiates downtown traffic. Behind the 
           wheel is the Chief’s Driver, OFFICER DARRYL GATES (23). 

           Behind Gates, sits LAPD CHIEF “WHISKEY BILL” PARKER (44) 
           a hard man from the Dakota Territory. His car’s equipped 
           with a RADIO PHONE and CAR PHONE. A NIGHTSTICK and ITHACA 
           SHOTGUN mounted up against the bulkhead. And Parker’s 
           personal touch: a built-in bar, WHISKEY and GLASSES. 

           Parker pours himself a few fingers of I.W. HARPER, sips, 
           grimaces. Next to him on the seat is The Los Angeles 
           Examiner. Headline: GANGLAND VIOLENCE PLAGUES SOUTHLAND.

           EXT. THE CROESUS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           LAPD COPS hold back a gathering CROWD, including a DOZEN 
           REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. STAFF 1 cruises by the 
           chaotic scene. Through his tinted window, Parker watches 
           shattered WOMEN, now wearing cop’s uniform tunics over 
           their stained clothes, squinting against the sun as COPS 
           lead them to AMBULANCES. The scene both lurid and tragic.  

                                 PARKER
                        This was Cohen’s place. Who took

           Parker ignores them as Gates drives away.

           INT. LOS ANGELES CITY HALL (DETECTIVES’ BULLPEN) - NIGHT

           Wooters leaning back, his chair up on two legs, his feet 
           braced against a desk, flirtily dictating his report to 
           the Watch Commander’s cute little SECRETARY. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        ...After I arrested him, Whalen 
                        managed to somehow escape from my 
                        vehicle while I was stopped for a 
                        red signal. Damnedest thing.

           Now, O’Mara drags the cuffed Racine and company through 
           the bullpen. UNIFORMS, CLERKS give him a wide berth. The 
           secretary looks up from her typing and almost gasps. Then 
           Wooters looks up, sees O’Mara’s swollen face. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        What happened to you this time?

                                 O’MARA
                        They resisted.

           Racine and his goons look even worse.

                                 WOOTERS
                        What happened to them?

                                 O’MARA
                        They resisted.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Sheesh. You’re workin’ too hard.

           O’Mara sees MAX SOLOMON, pin-striped mob lawyer, walk out 
           of the Watch Commander’s Office. Racine smiles knowingly.
           INT. WATCH COMMANDER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           O’Mara brings Racine before LT. QUINCANNON (50s) at his 
           desk. Lt. Quincannon’s face booze-blotched and baggy.

                                 QUINCANNON
                        Weren’t you supposed to be on a 
                        Dahlia Stakeout?

                                 O’MARA
                        I was.

                                 QUINCANNON
                        So what the hell are you doing?
                        Hendricks tells me you went in 
                        there without a warrant.

                                 O’MARA
                        It was exigent circumstances.

                                 QUINCANNON
                        Judge Krauss saw it differently.

           Quincannon hands O’Mara some folded court DOCUMENTS.

                                 O’MARA
                        Habeas corpus. 
                                 (flipping pages)
                        For all four of them. That’s fast 
                        work. If I didn’t know better I’d 
                        think somebody here stiffed in a 
                        call.

                                 QUINCANNON
                        You’ve been admin-transferred, 
                        what? Five times, in six months? 
                        That’s gotta be a record. And you 
                        keep steppin’ on corns like they 
                        give a merit badge for it. We got 
                        rules around here, O’Mara. Do 
                        yourself a favor and learn ‘em. 

           INT. DETECTIVES BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

           O’Mara storms out of Quincannon’s office. Wooters watches 
           him go. And after a moment, Wooters follows O’Mara out.
           EXT. STEPS OF CITY HALL - NIGHT

           Alone in the rain, O’Mara leans against one of the 
           columns in front of LOS ANGELES CITY HALL. He watches 
           Racine and the others walking out free men. 

           A 1948 Packard Custom 8 LIMO pulls up, idling there on 
           Main. Racine and the others don’t look so cocky anymore. 

           O’Mara watches a HUGE MAN get out of the Limo. We 
           recognize him as KARL LENNOX.

                                 WOOTERS (O.S.)
                        Cohen’s bodyguard. Former State 
                        Trooper name of Karl Lennox. 

           O’Mara sees Wooters standing there, just getting some 
           air.

                                 WOOTERS
                        He was a gift from the Attorney 
                        General.  Do you know the Attorney 
                        General? 
                                 (off his head shake)
                        Neither do I. 

           Racine and his men climb into the Limo. Lennox and O’Mara 
           lock eyes through the rain. Lennox doesn’t smile at him 
           so much as bare his teeth as he touches his hat brim.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Look, I’m sure I’m not the first 
                        guy to tell you this, but please 
                        don’t feed or tease Mickey Cohen. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Doesn’t it bother you? 

                                 WOOTERS
                        No. Not for a long time.

           Watching the limo pull away, O’Mara looks like a wolf 
           with his leg in a trap. Nothing he can do about this.

           INT. O’MARA’S HOME - NIGHT

           The modest home is the best they can manage on an honest 
           cop’s salary. The milk is powdered, the furniture second-
           hand. The ceiling leaks into a Yuban can. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           CONNIE O’MARA, pretty, whip smart, with her own war 
           souvenirs, hands hardened by Lockheed Martin, lounges in 
           an easy chair, a used copy of Chandler’s The Little 
           Sister braced on her pregnant belly. Old copies of True 
           Detective in the magazine rack, her girlish vice.

           Connie lifts the Yuban can, dumps water in the sink. When 
           she comes back, O’Mara is in the doorway, looking like a 
           kid who’s torn the knees of his church trousers. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Hail the conquering hero.

                                 O’MARA
                        This time, Boss, I swear I didn’t 
                        go looking for it. Scout’s honor. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Don’t kid me. You go looking for 
                        it every time you leave the house. 

           And we HEAR the Mills Brothers’ I Love You So Much It 
           Hurts...

           INT. O’MARA’S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

           ...From a small table-top radio. O’Mara soaking in the 
           bathtub. Raw. Vulnerable. He’s powerfully built, but 
           heroics have cost him. Battle scars lace bare skin. 

                                 O’MARA
                        You know, there were people over 
                        there... when the Krauts came for 
                        their neighbors, they just stood 
                        there. And they let it happen. 

           Connie dips her washcloth into pink water, sponges his 
           bloody arm where Racine’s razor bit through his sleeve. 

                                 O’MARA
                                 (off her look)
                        Some pimp. He was going to put the 
                        hurt on this poor kid who didn’t 
                        know any better. Fact, she looked 
                        a little like you. Well, you know, 
                        not nearly as pretty, but- 

                                 CONNIE
                        -Smooth talk isn’t your line, 
                        Sarge. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 O’MARA
                        -No, I’m serious. I don’t know, 
                        maybe it was the way she wore her 
                        hair, reminded me of that time we 
                        went to Catalina before the war.

                                 CONNIE
                        You can’t keep this up, baby. I 
                        know you think you can, but you 
                        can’t. Not if you want to live.
                                 (searching his eyes)
                        You do, don’t you? Want to live?

                                 O’MARA
                        What the hell kind of a question 
                        is that? Of course I do. 

           But he can’t meet her eyes. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Then I need you to do something 
                        for me. John, I need you to 
                        unlearn what you learned over 
                        there. Please. 

           She takes his face in her hands, steers his eyes to hers.

                                 CONNIE
                        Come back to me. 

           He kisses her, winces, wraps his arms around her. And in 
           spite of everything, she can’t stop herself from melting 
           into him as he climbs from the tub, soaking her clothes.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           TIGHT ON: Gloved hands SNAPPING a PADLOCK over the bars 
           of that CAGE ELEVATOR where O’Mara battled earlier.

                                 COHEN (V.O.)
                        Whores don’t grow on trees. 
                        They’re like mustangs. You gotta 
                        catch ‘em wild, break them before 
                        you can train them to do tricks. 

           INT. THE CROESUS (DESERTED HALLWAYS) - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Cohen’s explosives expert, ‘RED’ GRANT, a former fireman 
           turned firebug, rolls 50-gallon drums down dark hallways.

                        Means I need a quiet place to lock 
                        the girls up, keep them hopped up 
                        on Mexican dope. This cop came out 
                        of nowhere, like an early frost. 
                        And now my whole crop’s ruined

           Grant feeding rag-ropes, tied together like magician’s 
           kerchiefs, into the spigot of each drum. Fuses. 

           INT. CROESUS LOBBY - NIGHT

           Racine and his thugs sit on the couches. They’re 
           terrified, facing MICKEY COHEN and his PRAETORIAN GUARD: 
           KARL LENNOX, NEDDY HERBERT: A hawk-faced hitman. JIMMY 
           WREVOK: A fell creature with a scar down through his left 
           eye, leaving that eye milky and gibbous. And JOHNNY 
           ‘STOMP’ STOMPANATO: All-pro murderer with looks that land 
           him in bed with the likes of Lana Turner.

                                 RACINE
                        Mr. Cohen, I swear to God-

           Cohen’s obsidian eyes, like those of Kipling’s King 
           Cobra, seem to have the power to hypnotize. Racine’s 
           already pissed himself and still he cannot look away.

                                 COHEN
                        You’re talkin’ to God, Mitch. So 
                        maybe you better swear to me.

                                 RACINE
                        I swear to You, sir, if it hadn’t 
                        a been for that cop-

                                 COHEN
                        -You think I’m sore at this cop? 
                        Hell, no. He’s a square Joe, this 
                        guy, rescues a damsel in distress. 
                        Goddamn hero is what he is. Guy 
                        deserves a medal. In fact ...
                                 (to Lennox)
                        What’s this guy workin? 

                                 LENNOX
                        Homicide.

                                 COHEN
                        Naw. That’s rough duty. Let’s fix 
                        him up with a nice sit-down job.

           INT. CROESUS HALLWAYS - NIGHT

           Grant’s ZIPPO LIGHTER FLICKS open to LIGHT the gas-damp 
           rags. Then Grant RUNS, his face flush with fire-lust.

                                 COHEN (V.O.)
                        Tomorrow, this place is all over 
                        the front page. I got to start all 
                        over somewhere else. We had a good 
                        thing goin, Mitch. But, you know 
                        what they say? All good things 
                        must one day burn to the ground 
                        for the insurance money. 

           Almost simultaneously, the barrels EXPLODE, swirling 
           flames fill the Croesus hallways like dragon’s breath.

           INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

           Fire climbs the shaft like a chimney. We hear SCREAMS 
           over the inferno... 

           INT. CROESUS LOBBY - NIGHT

                                 RACINE
                        Mr. Cohen, I’m so sorry. I swear. 
                        It won’t ever happen again.

           Cohen reaches out to ruffle Racine’s hair, then gives him 
           an affectionate punch on the jaw.

                                 COHEN
                        I know it, kid.

           INT. CAGE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           And we see RACINE and his thugs have been LOCKED inside 
           the ELEVATOR: they pile on each other, crabs in a trap. 
           Clawing, climbing over each other, rabid to escape the 
           RISING FLAMES. The cable SNAPS. And the elevator FALLS 
           down, down into the fires of hell.

                                 QUINCANNON (PRELAP)
                        O’Mara! Get in here.
           INT. LA CITY HALL (QUINCANNON’S OFFICE) - NEXT DAY

           O’Mara stands, facing Quincannon like a firing squad. 
           Quincannon smiles, sliding fresh-cut ADMINISTRATIVE 
           TRANSFER ORDERS across his desk to O’Mara. O’Mara doesn’t 
           even need to look at them. His eyes on the Lieutenant.

                                 QUINCANNON
                        I’m transferring you to 
                        Bunco/Forgery, effective 
                        immediately. You’re all through in 
                        homicide, O’Mara.

           O’Mara shakes his head, son of a goddamned bitch.

           INT. BUNCO/FORGERY SECTION - DAY

           O’Mara’s tucked in the corner of the backwater BUNCO UNIT 
           surrounded by MIDDLE-AGED DETECTIVES. Washouts and 
           burnouts, circling racing forms, crosswords, playing 
           solitaire, tipping flasks into coffee mugs. Christ.

           O’Mara opens the The Los Angeles Times. The HEADLINE: IN 
           WAKE OF SCANDAL, CROESUS BUILDING CONSUMED BY FIRE. 
           O’Mara doodles devil’s horns on a front page PHOTO of 
           MICKEY COHEN.

                                 GATES (O.S.)
                        Sergeant O’Mara? 

           O’Mara turns to see OFFICER DARRYL GATES (23).

                        I’m Darryl Gates.

                        Who the hell is Darryl Gates?

                                 GATES
                        The Chief’s driver. He would like 
                        a word with you, Sergeant. 

           INT. CHIEF PARKER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Parker’s office is immaculate, Spartan, all the more 
           imposing for its lack of adornment. The large window 
           behind Parker’s desk looks out over Los Angeles. O’Mara 
           stands at parade-rest before CHIEF PARKER. He opens 
           O’Mara’s FILE.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Your approach to police work has 
                        not won you many friends on this 
                        department, Sergeant O’Mara.
                        Lieutenant Quincannon tells me 
                        you’re brutal and insubordinate. 
                                 (beat)
                        And coming from a man like him, I 
                        consider that high praise indeed.

           Parker signals to Gates, who pours two whiskies.

                                 PARKER
                        Please, sit.

           Gates places them in front of Parker and O’Mara. 

                                 PARKER (CONT’D)
                        You worked with the French 
                        Resistance during the war. Trained 
                        at Camp X, did you not? 

                                 O’MARA
                        I’ve never heard of Camp X, sir.

                                 PARKER
                        No. No, of course you haven’t.
                        Nevertheless, with your service 
                        record, one would assume you are 
                        not unskilled in guerilla warfare.

                                 O’MARA
                        I survived. A lot of better men 
                        didn’t. This why you wanted to see 
                        me, sir? To talk about the war?

                                 PARKER
                        I want to talk about the war for 
                        the soul of Los Angeles, Sergeant.

           Parker moves to the window, looking out over Los Angeles.

                                 PARKER (CONT’D)
                        Our forebearers fought savage 
                        Indians and Mexican Banditry to 
                        win Los Angeles. And now we’re

                        gangland homicide in over ten 
                        years.

                        Well, you’ve got the best cops 
                        money can buy here, sir.

                                 PARKER
                        Thank you for volunteering, 
                        Sergeant O’Mara.

                                 O’MARA
                        You’re welcome, sir. To do what?

                                 PARKER
                        What I cannot. Not officially.
                        You’re going to wage a guerilla 
                        campaign against Mickey Cohen.
                        This isn’t a crime wave. It’s an 
                        enemy occupation. Cohen’s using 
                        arms smuggled back from the war to 
                        terrorize our citizens. Weapons 
                        we’ve never seen in Los Angeles. 
                        And he’s winning. Taking over.

                                 O’MARA
                        What about the Feds, sir?

                                 PARKER
                        Hoover still refuses to 
                        acknowledge the existence of the 
                        Syndicate. We’re on our own.

                                 O’MARA
                        I’ll need men. And weapons.

                                 PARKER
                        Recruit a small squad. Half a 
                        dozen men at most. And keep it 
                        quiet, is that clear? Anonymity 
                        will be your greatest weapon 
                        against Cohen. Secrecy will be 
                        your sword, and your shield. If 
                        Cohen learns of your existence, I 
                        won’t be able to protect you. So 
                        you’re to make no arrests. 

                                 O’MARA

                        Cohen owns the courts. So arrests 
                        are worse than useless. Money is 
                        what brought him. And if you cost 
                        him enough money, if you shatter 
                        his operations here, he’ll move on 
                        to Las Vegas or some other godless 
                        Gomorrah. I don’t care. As long as 
                        he leaves Los Angeles. 
                                 (beat)
                        Cohen is a cancer on this town.

                        So where have you been all my 
                        miserable life, Jerry the Bible

           INT. O’MARA’S HOME - NIGHT

           O’Mara sits on the sofa with Connie. She’s not happy.

                                 O’MARA
                        Look, it’s gonna be a secret 
                        outfit, okay? Strictly hit and 
                        run. And I’ll come home to you 
                        every night. Scout’s honor.

                                 CONNIE
                        But why does it have to be you?

                                 O’MARA
                        I got volunteered. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Oh, of course you did.

                                 O’MARA
                        We moved out here, you said we’d 
                        found paradise. Remember? Wind was 
                        right, we’d smell the ocean 
                        through the bedroom window. 
                                 (beat)
                        That’s what kept me going when I 
                        was over there. Getting back here 
                        to you. Raising our family here. 
                        I’m not gonna let Cohen poison it. 

                                 CONNIE
                        I never told you this. But once, 
                        while you were overseas, a 
                        government car came up our street. 
                        Two Army officers got out of it. I 
                        could see them checking addresses. 
                        They were coming here. To tell me 
                        you were dead. I was sure of it. 
                                 (beat)
                        I put myself through all that 
                        because I had to. But honey? I 
                        can’t go through it again.

           She walks out into the kitchen.
           INT. O’MARA’S KITCHEN - HOURS LATER

           O’Mara sits at their small kitchen table, pouring over a 
           pile of PERSONNEL FILES. Connie carries grilled cheese 
           sandwiches to the table, pours the milk.

                                 CONNIE
                        Stubborn son of a bitch.

           And with a sigh, she reaches across the table to open the 
           files. O’Mara watches her sharp eyes scan them. Backing 
           his play despite his intransigence. God, he loves her.

                                 O’MARA
                        You’re something else, you know 
                        it?

                                 CONNIE
                        Well, you’re gonna do it anyway. I 
                        might as well help you stay alive.
                                 (takes a bite, reads)
                        Top of his class. Top of his 
                        class. This one made detective 
                        before his thirtieth birthday. 

                                 O’MARA
                        What’s the matter, boss?

                                 CONNIE
                        If I’m Cohen, these are the first 
                        cops I’m going to buy. They’ll be 
                        Lieutenants in a few years. 

                                 O’MARA
                        So you’re saying I need to find 
                        other bums like me. 

                                 CONNIE
                        There’s nobody like you, Sarge. 
                                 (kissing him)
                        I’m saying you shouldn’t be 
                        looking at boy scouts for this. 

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - BRILLIANT NIGHT

           O’Mara DRIVING down CENTRAL AVENUE, Bee-bop Babylon. ZOOT 
           SUITERS with flashy ties and diamond stickpins, LADIES 
           with frills and feathers, heading straight for that 
           vertical neon beacon at 42nd and Central: CLUB ALABAM.

                        Excessive Force. Insubordination. 
                        Brutality.

           INT. O’MARA’S HOME - NIGHT

           O’Mara and Connie are on their bed with a bowl of popcorn 
           and a BOX marked ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINE. Pilfered 
           PERSONNEL FILES spread out on the bed around them, the 
           officers’ MUGS clipped to each manila. Connie is reading 
           from the file of OFFICER AARON ‘ROCKY’ WASHINGTON.

                                 CONNIE
                                 (passing it over)
                        Sounds like a man after your own 
                        dear heart, Sarge.

           INT. CLUB ALABAM - NIGHT

           CHARLIE PARKER blowing ‘Lester Leaps In’ with JOHNNY OTIS 
           and his 16-piece BAND. Hypnotic, ecstatic bebop. And over 
           at the BAR, enjoying the show... 

                                 O’MARA (V.O.)
                        Rocky Washington. First Negro 
                        Lieutenant on the department. Only 
                        one to ever hand back his bars. 

           ROCKY WASHINGTON (30s) They call him the Sheriff of 
           Central Avenue. A carved-oak statue in trench and fedora. 
           The descendent of a runaway slave and a Mescalero Apache. 

           Right now, Washington has his eyes on a dangerous dope-
           peddler, name of DUKE DEL-RED. Across the room, Del-Red 
           passes a BINDLE of HEROIN to a lovely GIRL in chiffon. 

                                 O’MARA (V.O.)
                        Threw his whole career away to go 
                        back to walking a beat down on 
                        Central Avenue.

           Washington’s SWITCHBLADE is out of his pocket, thumbing 
           the button -shickt- the blade gleaming as Washington 
           wrist-flicks his knife, the blade BUZZES through the air 
           like a shuriken THUNKING into Del Red’s palm, stigmata-
           pinning his bejeweled right hand to the wall. Del-Red 
           howls, the music stops, and the girl scurries away. 

           Del-Red still pinned, reaches for the knife, hesitates. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 WASHINGTON
                        It’s okay, Del. Don’t wiggle it 
                        now. Be better if you just yank it 
                        straight out. 

           Del-Red closes his eyes and PULLS. The crowd gasps 
           involuntary sympathy. 

                                 WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Good boy. Now, wipe the blade on 
                        your trousers. Both sides. 

           Humiliated, Del-Red cleans the blade on his WHITE 
           TROUSERS, painting them with blood. Ruined. 

                                 WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Now close it up. And give it here.

           Washington’s palm out, a teacher receiving a slingshot. 
           Del-Red shame-crosses the room and places it carefully in 
           Washington’s waiting hand. Washington pockets the knife. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Now, git. And don’t let me catch 
                        you boys in here again. You just 
                        lost your Alabam privileges. 

           Del-Red leaves. And CHARLIE PARKER instantly picks up 
           where he left off. O’Mara approaches Washington.

                                 O’MARA
                        Sergeant John O’Mara. Buy you a 
                        drink?

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Well, seein’ as I’m on duty, 
                        Sergeant. You better buy me two. 

           INT. CLUB ALABAM - BAR - NIGHT

           O’Mara and Washington drinking whiskey, watching RUTH 
           OLAY onstage singing ‘How High The Moon.’

                        Avenue right down to the bone. I 
                        lost my niece to it. Year ago. But 
                        you already knew that. It’s there 
                        in my file, isn’t it, Sarge?

                        Yes. It is. I’m sorry. I came to 
                        take you upriver, Lieutenant. All 
                        the way to the headwaters. You can 
                        plug it up right at the source.

           Washington smiles.

           EXT. CON KEELER’S HOUSE - SUNDOWN

           OFFICER CONWAY KEELER (30s) puttering in his open garage. 
           Smallish, wiry guy. Wife shoves chow into his mouth like 
           feeding coal into a furnace. But his engine burns faster 
           and brighter than most. Keeler’s working on his son’s 
           bike with the same precision that he does everything. 

           O’Mara walks up Keeler’s driveway. O’Mara glances around 
           the garage. Military-grade ELECTRONICS EQUIPMENT, state-
           of-the-art stuff, arranged on Keeler’s workbench.

                                 O’MARA
                        Conway Keeler?

                                 KEELER
                        Be with you in a minute, fella.

           Keeler finishes. The wheel spins smooth as glass. Keeler 
           flips the bike, righting it for his son, CHARLIE. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thanks, Dad.

           As his son rides away, Keeler turns to face O’Mara. 

                                 KEELER
                        Yeah?

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - LATER (NIGHTFALL)

           Keeler’s wife MARCIA hands O’Mara and Keeler iced tea. 

                            KEELER
           Thanks, baby.
                                                         O’MARA
                                              Thank you, ma’am.

           She gives O’Mara a look of suspicion and moves on.

                                 O’MARA
                        Heard you were the best wireman on 
                        the department. And now they got 
                        you working traffic. What gives?

                                 KEELER
                        Vice wanted a wire on a little 
                        bookie named Robbins. A nobody. 

                                  O’MARA
                        They only ever pinch the nobodies.

                                 KEELER
                        So I recorded the usual chatter, 
                        you know, wagers, markers. Then 
                        one night Robbins started going on 
                        about this new outfit called 
                        Guarantee Finance. Said it was 
                        going to put them out of business. 

                                 O’MARA
                        You take that to vice?

                                 KEELER
                        They lost the tapes. And I woke up 
                        writing traffic tickets. Robbins 
                        disappeared. I think somebody put 
                        him on the submarine to Catalina. 

           They watch Keeler’s wife and son in the front window.

                                 O’MARA
                        Look, the other guys I’m askin, 
                        none of ‘em have families. So if 
                        you want to think this over... 

                                 KEELER
                        I’ve been thinking it over for 
                        months. And it’s not so much the 
                        traffic tickets I mind. Because, 
                        look, I can shovel shit with the 
                        best of ‘em. I mean, I was in the 
                        Army for Christ’s sake. But this- 
                                 (re: his home)
                        This right here, this is what we 
                        fought for, isn’t it?

                        Yes it is. 

                                 KEELER
                        Well I sure as hell didn’t sign up 
                        just to hand it all over to Cohen. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Yeah. Neither did I.
           O’MARA’S KITCHEN - DAY

           O’Mara and Connie at lunch. Canned tomato soup and 
           crackers. Connie takes a breath and slides a copy of TRUE 
           DETECTIVE MAGAZINE across the kitchen table to O’Mara. 

                                 O’MARA
                        What’s this?

           A Stanley-Borack painted cover of OFFICER MAX KENNARD, 
           gun blazing. Headline: GUNFIGHT ON GLENDALE BOULEVARD.

                                 CONNIE
                        He’s shot more crooks than any LA 
                        cop in the last hundred years. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Connie, I can’t just pull some guy 
                        out of a magazine like he’s a 
                        decoder ring. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Well, I’m sorry, Sarge, but you 
                        don’t get to turn your nose up at 
                        anybody who might save your life. 

           EXT. OLVERA STREET - DAY

           O’Mara CROSSES HIMSELF as he walks past the ornate wooden 
           CROSS, entering PLAZA OLVERA. Charro STREET MUSICIANS & 
           white-lace folklorico DANCERS. And Cafe Caliente.

           INT. CAFE CALIENTE - CONTINUOUS

           Tex Ritter’s ‘Rye Whiskey’ curling from a radio. Sitting 
           with his back to the wall, OFFICER MAX KENNARD (ken-nerd) 
           A laconic Texan. Hands-down the deadliest cop in LA. 

           Kennard’s young partner: OFFICER NAVIDAD RAMIREZ, open-
           faced Mexican kid, former all-Valley sprinter. 
           Immigrant’s son, eager to prove himself. Kennard 
           cautiously watches O’Mara approach his table. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Mind if I join you fellas?

           Kennard shrugs, eating beans. O’Mara pulls up a chair. 
           Kennard signals the dusky WAITRESS for doz cervezas.

                                 KENNARD
                        Aw, it’s alright for a burlesque 
                        dancer, but I keep tellin him 
                        that’s no kinda name for a lawman.

           Ramirez rolls his eyes, a teenager at the mall with dad.

                                 O’MARA
                                 (to Kennard)
                        Can I talk to you a minute?

                                 KENNARD
                        Go on, Na-vee-dad. Get some air.

           Ramirez gets up from the table, heading outside, but he 
           lingers just outside the door, unseen, listening.

                                 O’MARA
                        Kid’s not going to last long 
                        riding with you.

                        Nobody’ll work with him. On 
                        account of his heritage. 

           INT. CAFE CALIENTE - MINUTES LATER

           Kennard doctors his beer with hot sauce and lime. O’Mara 
           drinks, counting the NOTCHES scalloped into the butt of 
           Kennard’s magnificent .45 Caliber Colt Peacemaker.

                                 KENNARD
                        True Detective. Nothin’ true in 
                        it. Thanks to those chuckleheads 
                        every pistolero in LA wants to be 
                        the man who took Max Kennard. 

           BLAM TO: Smoke curling from Kennard’s gun. A ZOOT-SUITER 
           clutches his bloody hand. His gun on the ground.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        that on the job.

           O’Mara sets his bottle down at the edge of the table-

                                 KENNARD
                        Well, let’s just say I misspent my 
                        youth.

                                 O’MARA
                        I’m going after Mickey Cohen. And 
                        I’m looking for a gun hand.

           -and O’Mara’s finger deliberately pushes the beer bottle 
           off the edge of the table. The bottle falling through 
           empty air on its way to the tile floor as O’Mara BRINGS 
           his hand up from under the table, DRAWING, his finger 
           pointed like a gun. But Kennard’s faster, drawing his 
           PEACEMAKER, beating O’Mara, even as Kennard’s left hand 
           CATCHES the bottle without spilling a drop. He smiles.

                                 KENNARD
                        Wouldn’t you know it? I just 
                        happen to have one.

           EXT. O’MARA’S HOME - DAY

           O’Mara’s on a ladder leaned against the house, cleaning 
           out the gutters. Connie’s lounging on the front porch 
           swing, with a glass of lemonade and more personnel files. 
           Connie watches him toss handfuls of gunk to the ground.   

                                 CONNIE
                        You’re kind of a bull in a china 
                        shop, you know it? 

                                 O’MARA
                        You’re talkin’ about sex, right?

                                 CONNIE
                                 (ignoring him)
                        You can’t just kick down every 
                        door in town. You’re going to need 
                        someone who can open a few of them 
                        for you.

           She opens the file labeled SGT. JERRY WOOTERS.
           INT. SIXTH-FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           O’Mara heads for the DETECTIVE MUSTER ROOM. Inside, 
           Wooters stands, addressing a room full of UNIFORMED COPS. 

           INT. DETECTIVE’S MUSTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           O’Mara stands against the wall, watching Wooters muster 
           his troops, preparing for another ‘raid.’ 

                                 WOOTERS
                        We’ll be hitting one of Dragna’s 
                        joints. Little Wikiup on Wilshire 
                        called The Cabana Club. Some of 
                        you might even be familiar with 
                        it. Hell, I know I am.

           Chuckles from the uniforms.

                                 WOOTERS (CONT’D)
                        You’ll stage your prowlers on 
                        Berendo, behind the Talmadge. The 
                        bomb bay doors open at 2100 hours. 

           Wooters notices O’Mara waiting against the wall. 

                                 WOOTERS (CONT’D)
                        Alright. See you at the front.

           The uniforms file out.

           INT. DETECTIVE’S MUSTER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

                                 O’MARA
                        I’m going after Cohen. And I need 
                        an Indian guide, someone who knows 
                        the terrain. Figured you might 
                        want a chance to do this for real.

                                 WOOTERS
                        You figured wrong, pal. You’re 
                        Section 8, you know it? No wonder 
                        they keep bouncing you all over 
                        the damn city. Christ, how do you 
                        know I won’t just turn around and 
                        rat you out to Cohen? 

                                 O’MARA
                        You won’t. I checked you out. 
                        You’re leading the division in 
                        arrests.

                        gamblers you keep pulling out of 
                        these bullshit raids. So I figure 
                        you’ve got a guardian angel 
                        somewhere in Dragna’s outfit, but 
                        I don’t think you’re on the arm. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Yeah, but you don’t know that.

                                 O’MARA
                        I survived over there, in part, 
                        because I’m a fair judge of men. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Well, hell, then you oughta know 
                        Parker’s just using you. 

           Something flickers across O’Mara’s eyes.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Why don’t you get smart? You’re 
                        not gonna change a damn thing. 
                        You’re just going to wake up one 
                        morning walking on the wrong side 
                        of the grass. And for what? 

                                 O’MARA
                        My home. My family. Wooters, you 
                        got nobody in your life worth 
                        fightin’ for, then what the hell

           Wooters, absorbing this, conflicted. O’Mara walks out.

           EXT. UNDER THE OLYMPIC BRIDGE - NIGHT

           O’Mara’s meager, ragtag squad is now assembled in the 
           shadows on the LA river. Kennard, Washington, Keeler. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Some of you may have heard there 
                        was a Syndicate rule against 
                        killing cops. But I am here to 
                        tell you this Mickey Cohen is a 
                        different animal. And he will not 
                        hesitate to take your life. That’s 
                        what Mickey Cohen has in store for 
                        us if we’re caught. Lead. That’s 
                        our prize for comin’ in second.

                        Come on, don’t candy-coat it, 
                        Sarge. Give it to us straight.

                                 O’MARA
                        Anybody wants out, now’s the time. 

           But none of them are going anywhere. O’Mara nods.

                                 O’MARA
                        You want to know what first prize 
                        is? Nothing. If we succeed in our 
                        mission, and I wouldn’t put money 
                        on that, but if we succeed nobody 
                        will ever know what we’ve done.

                        Officially, this unit does not and 
                        will not exist. We wouldn’t last a 
                        day trading body blows with Cohen. 
                        Our only advantage is that he 
                        won’t know who we are. So I have 
                        only one rule in this outfit. 

           O’Mara holds up his LAPD BADGE.

                        You wanna ride with me, you leave 
                        these at home. Carry nothing that 
                        identifies you as a police 
                        officer. Because make no mistake, 
                        what we do from here on out will 
                        not be legal. This isn’t police 
                        work. It’s guerilla warfare.
                                 (beat)
                        Cohen’s juice comes from three 
                        sources: gambling, prostitution, 
                        and dope. That’s where we’ll cut 
                        him. Cohen bleeds enough profit, 
                        he’ll have to pack up his circus 
                        and take it on the road. 

           Movement in the shadows. They all whirl on the sound, 
           GUNS drawn... Navidad Ramirez steps out, hands up.

                        he is. In fact, yeah, why don’t 
                        you boys just go on and shoot him. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                        You let him follow you here? Yeah, 
                        nice goin’ there, Hoppalong.

                        Fine. But he’s your mess. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        So when do we start, Sarge?

                                 O’MARA
                        Tonight. We’re hitting his casino 
                        across the river in Burbank.

           EXT. CABANA CLUB - NIGHT

           Wooters loiters at a newsstand next to the Cabana Club’s 
           awning, just across from the Ambassador, when PETE 
           approaches with his shine box. Wooters is off his game, 
           distracted. 

                                 PETE
                        Shine?

                                 WOOTERS
                        Make it quick, Pete. 

           Pete’s hard-worn hands fly over Wooters’ shoes.

                                 PETE
                        So, when are you planning to raid 
                        this place?
                                 (chin-pointing)
                        Plainclothes over there next to 
                        the Buick? He might as well be 
                        wearing a sandwich board.

                        21 hundred. Nine o’clock. You’ve 
                        got a magic eye, amigo. Ever 
                        thought about becoming one of us?

                                 PETE
                        No thanks, Jerry. No future in it. 
                        All the money’s on the other side. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        I guess I can’t argue with that.
                                 (beat)
                        You eating alright?

           Pete finishes up Wooters’ shoes, his palm out for a tip. 
           Wooters palms Pete a folded bill.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Vegetables.

           A BLACK CADILLAC pulls to the curb across the street, 
           steam curling from the tailpipe. Four MEN get out, moving 
           with purpose, heading straight for the Cabana Club.

                                 PETE
                        Hey, I thought you didn’t start 
                        until nine o’clock. 

           Wooters watches the gibbous-eyed JIMMY WREVOK and four 
           HATCHETMEN, trench coats like vampire-capes as they cross 
           the street, not hurrying, just taking an angle.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Those aren’t my guys.

           Wooters SHOVES Pete behind a cab, draws his revolver.

                                 WOOTERS (CONT’D)
                        Get down. Behind the engine block. 

           WREVOCK AND HIS HATCHETMEN (MOVING):

                                 WREVOCK
                        Paint me a nice group portrait.

           M-3 SUBMACHINE GUNS and MP-40 SCHMEISSERS swing up out of 
           their coats on custom swivel-rigs to unleash a ROARING 
           TORRENT of GUNFIRE. Lead flies through parked cars and 
           PEOPLE as easily as it flies through the night air. 

           Wooters takes a bead and FIRES back, squeezing the 
           trigger, not jerking it. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           His .38 barely audible against the HOWL of the full-auto 
           M-3s as Wooters puts a round into the first Hatchetman’s 
           chest. 

           Wrevock watches the guy next to him flop facedown in the 
           street. Huh? Then another one of Wooters’ rounds buzzes 
           by his ear. Wrevock scans the street, finding the source 
           of the gunfire, draws a bead on Wooters with his M-3 just 
           as... SIRENS. Wooters’ LAPD PROWL CARS pulling up to the 
           raid. Wrevock and his crew turn their guns on the cops!

           Windows implode. Fenders ulcerate. Prowl cars panic-
           swerve into parked cars. One black & white leaps the curb 
           and plows through the newsstand. WOUNDED COPS roll out of 
           their cars, scramble for cover. COPS grab Ithaca SHOTGUNS 
           and pump buckshot back at Cohen’s men. A gunbattle rages. 

           BYSTANDERS cower, wounded and bawling. Wooters sees Pete 
           hunched behind the cab with his palms over his ears. 

           Wooters FIRES again, winging Wrevock, his .38 round 
           passing through Wrevock’s bicep. The sting of it spinning 
           Wrevock, with his finger still on the trigger. His M-3 
           careening, spraying, the bullet-impacts spreading across 
           storefronts and everything slows way down ...

           ... Wooters watches Wrevock’s wild gunfire; a Tornado of 
           flying lead, disintegrating all in its path, heading 
           straight for Pete, who’s still crouched behind the cab, 
           right where Wooters told him to stay. 

           Now Wooters is sprinting to reach Pete, running hard to 
           beat the gunfire, to get to Pete before the bullets do.

           Pete’s up against the cab, helplessly watching the 
           geysers of powdered sidewalk getting closer to him. Pete 
           turns to Wooters, all his streetwise attitude gone, 
           scared eyes pleading. But he can’t reach Pete in time.

           Wooters watches the rounds hitting Pete square. The boy’s 
           eyes going wide with shock. Wooters’ palms pressed over 
           Pete’s wounds. Wooters trying to hold the life inside 
           him, and watching it leave the kid’s eyes. Gone.

                                 WREVOCK (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Let’s blow.

           Backing toward their Caddy, firing to cover their escape. 

           Wooters stands with Pete’s blood on him. He SNATCHES a 
           shotgun from one of the cops cowering behind a prowler.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 COP
                        Jerry, don’t be stupid!

           He jacks a round into it, charging out into open street. 
           BOOM! Tromboning the slide. BOOM! Knocking one of Jimmy’s 
           Hatchetmen off his feet as Wrevock and the others pile 
           into their Caddy and burn rubber, leaving him. Wooters 
           chases them, BOOM! Firing another blast, shattering the 
           Caddy’s rear windshield as it screeches around the 
           corner. 

                                 HATCHETMAN (O.S.)
                        Oh Christ, I’m bad hurt. Somebody 
                        call a doctor. You, flatfoot, come 
                        on, buddy. Ring the doc, willya? 

           Wooters walks over, stands over the moaning Hatchetman, 
           who’s trying to hold himself together. A full load of 
           buckshot in his gut. Recognition in the man’s eyes.

                                 HATCHETMAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I know you, right? Yeah, 
                        yeah, you’re Jerry Wooters. 

           Wooters jacks another round into the tube, pointing the 
           shotgun directly at the man’s face, inches from it. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Used to be.

           And pulls the trigger. BOOM!

           EXT. MARIPOSA HORSE STABLES IN BURBANK - NIGHT

           Here in the tight shadows, preparing for their first 
           raid. Washington thumbs shells into his shotgun. Ramirez 
           lifts an axe from the trunk of one of the Fords, takes a 
           practice swing at a hitching post. Keeler pulls a sap, 
           slaps his palm. Kennard just leans against the corral 
           fence, picking his teeth. A paint horse stamps, whinnies. 
           He cups his hand to the horse’s nose to quiet her. 

                                 O’MARA
                        If you have to fire, fire over 
                        their heads. Put a few holes in 
                        the ceiling. Let ‘em think we’re 
                        knockin’ the place over. Then we 
                        axe all the slots and tables.
           EXT. MARIPOSA ROAD - SECONDS LATER

                                 O’MARA (V.O.)
                        We’re in and out in ten minutes. 
                        And back across the river before 
                        they even know what hit ‘em.

           An actual tumble weed drifts across Mariposa Road: just a 
           dirt track between the LA river and Riverside Drive. From 
           the shadows, the squad watch a war party of painted 
           ‘COMANCHES’ crossing Mariposa. The scene surreal. 

                                 COMANCHE 1
                        Think the Great Spirit’s with us 
                        tonight, Chief? 

                                 COMANCHE 2
                        Hell, He better be. Squaw need’m 
                        new pair of moccasins.

           The Comanches LAUGH, on their way into Cohen’s million-
           dollar RIVERSIDE CASINO: resembles a plantation, Tara on 
           the LA River. Laughter, music leaking from the windows. 
           Past the Casino, O’Mara can see the Warner Bros WATER 
           TOWER against the night sky. Keeler grins. They’re 
           extras, just a stone’s throw from the movie studio.

           INT. CASINO - NIGHT

           The squad walks into the smoke-choked casino, momentarily 
           stunned by the scene on the casino floor. It looks like a 
           costume party in here, the CROWD salted with more EXTRAS. 
           ROMAN CENTURIONS playing slots, CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS 
           around the roulette table, COWBOYS and INDIANS at 
           blackjack, and a dozen UNIFORMED COPS shooting craps. 

           But their BADGES say CITY of BURBANK. They’re REAL cops. 
           The cops jostle and laugh, caught up in their craps game, 
           each cop carries a .38 REVOLVER in a clamshell holster.

                                 KEELER
                        Those aren’t costumes, are they?

                                 O’MARA
                        No they are not. 

                                 KENNARD
                        Dirty sombitches’re guardin’ the 
                        place for Cohen. Call it, Sarge.

                                 O’MARA
                        Abort. We’re not killin’ any cops.

           CONTINUED:

           But two cops notice these suspicious characters and break 
           from their game, heading straight for the squad. A 
           COCKTAIL waitress with a tray full of BEER watches them. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                                 (backing up)
                        Then get ready to run. 

           Both Burbank cops pull their PISTOLS.

                                 O’MARA
                        We’re not lookin’ for trouble.

                                 COP
                        Well, you found some.

           The other cops leave the craps table, heading this way.

           Now, Kennard’s right hand slips under his coat, coming 
           out with his Peacemaker, fanning the hammer. BLAM! BLAM! 
           Exploding the BEER BOTTLES in the waitress’s tray. The 
           two cops shielding their eyes from flying glass. The 
           other Burbank cops draw on them. O’Mara and the squad RUN-

           EXT. MARIPOSA ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           -like hell across Mariposa Road. Burbank cops pouring, 
           out, firing wild. Kennard SHOOTING back over his shoulder 
           putting a round through a cop’s FOOT, dropping him. ARGH!

           EXT. MARIPOSA HORSE STABLES - CONTINUOUS

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Dust geysers chase the squad through 
           the stables. Fence posts splinter split-seconds after 
           Ramirez runs past them. Burbank cops chasing Washington. 
           O’Mara FIRES into the ground in front of the horses. 
           Horses spook, LEAPING their corrals, BREAKING fences. 
           Cops scramble, dodging the stampeding horses.

           I/E. THOMAS’ FORD SHERIDAN - CONTINUOUS

           Keeler climbs behind the wheel, but the engine won’t 
           turn. BLAM! Hunching as his windshield shatters. 

           O’Mara and Washington run to the back of the car, putting 
           their backs to the trunk, PUSHING it. BLAM! BLAM! The 
           Burbank cops fire, hitting the fenders. 

           Kennard gets out of his car FIRING to cover them BOOM! 
           BOOM! Explosions of dust backing up the Burbank cops.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Who you callin’ bwoy, peckerwood?

           Keeler POPS the clutch, the engine ROARS to life, 
           tailpipe belching smoke. TIRES spin, kicking up a 
           blinding STORM of ROILING dust. O’Mara and Washington are 
           now running to get into their Fords as they barrel down 
           the cement slopes of the Los Angeles River. Chaos. 

           And when the dust clears, the two Fords are gone, and 
           Washington and O’Mara are both left standing there, 
           surrounded by BURBANK COPS, all pointing pistols at them.

                            COP 1

                                              Now!

           Washington and O’Mara share a look and they both drop 
           their weapons and put their hands up. They’re caught.

           SPEEDING DOWN THE LA RIVERBED:

           The two Fords speed down the semi-dry banks of the LA 
           River, side by side, splashing through shallow water, 
           runaway horses galloping alongside them. Catching his 
           breath, Keeler glances over into the Ford running next to 
           his, and sees that Washington and O’Mara aren’t in it! 

                                 KEELER
                                 (shouting across)

                        I thought you had ‘em!

                        Son of a bitch!

           He SLAMS on his BRAKES, both cars spinning out. And we 
           HEAR It’s Only a Paper Moon, PRELAPPING from...

           INT. SLAPSY MAXIE’S NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Jean’s up on stage, singing It’s Only a Paper Moon for a 
           packed house, everyone having the time of their lives. 
           Whalen watches from his usual table, then he notices a 
           WAITER with a PHONE working his way to Cohen’s table.  

           AT COHEN’S TABLE:

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The waiter stands at attention with the house phone on a 
           platinum tray while Cohen takes the receiver, his palm 
           over his other ear, receiving the bad news. 

                                 COHEN
                                 (into phone)
                        When? What’d they make off with? 
                        Who’re they workin’ for? Well, 
                        they gotta be workin’ for 
                        somebody. No, no...

                        over to pick ‘em up.

           Small-town cop-shop. A few prowlers outside. Malevolent.

           working this late hour. The fewer witnesses the better. 

           INT. CHIEF JACKSON’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           OFFICER ‘CUB’ FUNSTON, the sadistic jailer, and burly 
           OFFICER WINTER haul O’MARA and WASHINGTON into the 
           Chief’s office in handcuffs. They’ve been worked over.

           Chief of Police, the corrupt and debauched ELMER JACKSON, 
           *who we recognize from Cohen’s table at Slapsy Maxie’s. 
           Sitting behind his desk, Jackson wears an ice cream suit 
           and chews plug tobacco. A stuffed bear stands behind him. 

                                 FUNSTON
                        Nigger had this on him.

           Funston places Washington’s stilleto on Jackson’s desk.

                                 CHIEF JACKSON
                                 (to Washington)
                        You packin’ a pig-sticker, Bwana?

           Funston drops a LEATHER BELT around Washington’s throat 
           and PULLS, cutting his air, forcing him to face Jackson.

                                 CHIEF JACKSON
                        You must be out here from Chicago.
                        Or maybe from goddamned Mars 
                        ‘cause everybody down here on 
                        Earth knows Mr. Cohen’s place is 
                        sacred ground. How ‘bout you?

                        Dragna put you up to this? 

           O’Mara gives him nothing. Chief Jackson’s eyes flick to 
           Funston. Funston smiles, drawing his TRUNCHEON. He CLUBS 
           O’Mara to the floor. Chief Jackson leans over and spits 
           tobacco into the spittoon. Shakes his head, lamenting. 

                                 CHIEF JACKSON
                        You’d best believe I’m askin’ you 
                        a lot nicer than Cohen’s gonna.

           INT. SLAPSY MAXIE’S NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Jean’s singing I’ve Got You On My Mind when Wooters walks 
           into Slapsy Maxie’s, and Jean almost forgets the lyrics 
           when she first sees him. Wooters looks nothing like he 
           did the last time we saw him here. Gone is the bon 
           vivant. In shock. Pete’s blood is still on his clothes. 
           Cigarette girls and revelers stare at Wooters, backing 
           away as Wooters walks past them like a somnambulist. 

           Jean finds Whalen in the crowd, signaling Whalen as she 
           sings by rolling her eyes to Wooters. *DO SOMETHING. 
           Because now Wooters is heading straight toward Cohen’s 
           table. He’s like a sleepwalker, outside his body, 
           watching his own hand reach into his coat pocket for-

           -Whalen GRABS Wooters, rough strength steering him into-

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Wooters struggles. Whalen SLAMS Wooters against the wall. 

                                 WHALEN
                        Listen to me. LISTEN. I heard 
                        about what happened and I’m awful 
                        sorry about Pete, but you gotta 
                        screw your head back on, cousin. 
                        Good’n tight. There’s a war on.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Yeah, no shit.

                                 WHALEN
                        But it ain’t yours. None of it. So 
                        don’t you pick it up. Don’t even 
                        touch it, hear? Just leave it lay.

                        Well, what’s Dragna doin’ about 
                        it?

                                 WHALEN
                        Dunno yet. I guess somebody just 
                        hit Cohen’s place in Burbank.
                                 (off Wooters)
                        And I know they think it was 
                        Dragna’s guys, but I can tell you 
                        for a natural fact it wasn’t.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Wait, wait. What?

                                 WHALEN
                        Craziest thing I ever heard. 
                        Coupla strong-arm boys made like 
                        to knock over Mickey’s Casino. 

           Crazy indeed. Wooters understands exactly what happened.

                                 WHALEN
                        Elmer’s boys nabbed two of ‘em and 
                        Cohen’s sendin’ some guys over 
                        there now.... Wait. Jerry, WAIT!

           But Wooters is already running out the door.

           I/E. BURBANK POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Funston and Winter lead O’Mara and Washington down to the 
           LOCKUP, SHOVE them sprawling on to the floor of their 
           CELL. Moth-eaten bunks. A slop bucket. Washington and 
           O’Mara share a look. They are so fucked. Funston slams 
           the bars and he and Winter walk back up the corridor. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Always knew I’d die in Burbank.

           O’Mara lifts the mattress off the bunk, tears a BEDSPRING 
           from the frame. O’Mara steps on the spring to straighten 
           it until he has something resembling a hook. 

                                 O’MARA
                        They won’t kill us here. But 
                        Cohen’ll send somebody to pick us 
                        up. And then you’ll wish they had.

           O’Mara’s practiced hands working the spring into his own 
           handcuffs, the old commando picking his cuffs in seconds.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Watch the corridor.

           O’Mara reaches out through the bars to fit the end of the 
           spring into the lock on their CELL DOOR. Washington keeps 
           watch while O’Mara works the spring into the lock.

           Washington hears a metallic sound and turns to see hands 
           LOCKING a CHAIN around the BARS of their cell WINDOW. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Uh, Sarge, you ain’t gonna believe 
                        this. But the Ringo Kid’s outside.

           Outside, Kennard crouches in the bushes, test-pulling the 
           chain. And we SEE the other end of the chain is looped 
           around the BUMPER of the FORD SHERIDAN parked on the 
           street. Ramirez hunched down behind the wheel. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                                 (to Kennard)
                        Christ, you know that’s about the 
                        dumbest thing I’ve ever seen.

                                 KENNARD
                        Well, that’s gratitude for ya.

           Keeler runs alongside the building, pops the JUNCTION BOX 
           and pulls a pair of BOLT CUTTERS, ready to cut the power. 
           Keeler looks over to see a guy get out of his car and 
           head into the front lobby. 

           INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           WOOTERS walks into the lobby, wearing a long overcoat, 
           and a tough-guy sneer. The desk officer looks him over.  

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Help you with somethin, pal?

           Wooters leans over the desk, right in the cop’s face.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Yeah, you can get off your ass and 
                        bring me your prisoners. 
           INT. LOCKUP - MOMENTS LATER

           In his haste to pick the lock, O’Mara BREAKS the end of 
           the spring off in the lock. Now, Funston and Winter are 
           leading Wooters back toward the cell. And O’Mara fumbles 
           blindly to pull the broken piece of spring out. O’Mara 
           manages to pull it out before they see him, but he drops 
           the broken piece in the corridor as they approach.

           O’Mara sits back down on the bunk, hands hidden in his 
           lap, watching Funston fit his key into the lock. And now, 
           O’Mara recognizes Wooters, but doesn’t let on. So he was 
           a fair judge of men after all. O’Mara’s eyes show Wooters 
           the broken spring on the floor. Funston hesitates.

                                 FUNSTON
                                 (to Wooters)
                        You got here awful quick.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Well, Mr. Cohen’s in a hurry. And 
                        so am I. 

                                 FUNSTON
                        Just one guy?

           Wooters steps to Funston, his shoe covering the spring.

                                 WOOTERS
                                 (playing tough)
                        I can handle ‘em. With plenty left 
                        over for you, you want some.
                                 (beat)
                        Open it.

           INT. LOBBY

           But Cohen’s two real GOONS walk into the lobby now, 
           heading straight for the suspicious desk officer. 

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Help you fellas?

                                 GOON 1
                        Yeah, we’re here to pick up some 
                        garbage. Two bags. 

           INT. LOCKUP

           Funston fits the big key into the lock. But now the DESK 
           OFFICER and Cohen’s goons are running back toward them.

                        Hold it! He’s bullshit!

           Funston turns to Wooters. Wooters PUNCHES him and- 

           -Keeler CUTS the POWER, plunging them all into DARKNESS-

           -Kennard signals. Ramirez FLOORS it. The chain tightens, 
           but instead of pulling the bars off the building, the 
           chain TEARS THE BUMPER OFF THE CAR! 

           -Confusion. Wooters fighting in near-total darkness. 
           Washington reaches his cuffed hands through the bars and 
           pulls WINTER’S HEAD against them, knocking him cold. 
           O’Mara reaches through the bars, fumbling, turning the 
           key. The door clacks open and O’Mara lunges out, a palm-
           strike putting Funston down, his elbow smashing the desk 
           officer’s temple. One of Cohen’s goons pulls his GUN. 
           Wooters grabs it. BOOM! BOOM! The muzzle FLASHES like a 
           strobe light, illuminating the brutal moments of the 
           fight - panels in a graphic novel - as Wooters expertly 
           twists the wild-firing gun away. It’s over quickly. 
           Cohen’s men, the desk officer, all beaten to the ground.  

           INT. CHIEF JACKSON’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Chief Jackson frozen in the darkness, hearing the BRAWL 
           and GUNSHOTS outside his office. He hears his door open.

                                 CHIEF JACKSON
                        Who’s there?

           He strikes a match. It FLARES, revealing Washington 
           smiling, flicking open his stiletto. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Bwana’s a Swahili word.

           Jackson flinches. The blade moves like lightning, nicking 
           Jackson under his chin, just a shaving cut. A reminder. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Means ‘Sir.’

           And blows out the match.

           O’Mara, Wooters and Washington run out of the police 
           station to meet Keeler, Kennard, and Ramirez.

                        And I thought you were smart. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Yeah, I guess I felt like doing 
                        something dumb for a change.

           line, draw .45 AUTOMATICS, bodies bladed to present a 
           leaner profile as they SQUEEZE off rounds at paper Colt 
           Police SILHOUETTE TARGETS set up on wooden stakes about 
           thirty yards away. *Standard police tactics for the era. 

           KENNARD leans against one of the Fords, sipping from a 
           flat-top can of EASTSIDE BEER. Just watching. Washington 
           holsters up, glancing back at Kennard, fucking annoyed.

                                 O’MARA
                        Good shooting, gentlemen. Just 
                        good enough to get you all dead.  
                                 (off their looks)
                        That’s a duellist’s stance, less 
                        about winning than it is about 
                        honor. Forget honor. Our enemy 
                        won’t stand still for us. And if 
                        we are going to win a gunfight 
                        against him, we have to be faster, 
                        and meaner, than he is.

           Feet square to his target, O’Mara DRAWS into a two-handed 
           grip, squeezes the trigger. BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM! 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           O’Mara cycling the weapon so fast his .45 auto sounds 
           like a MAC-10. O’Mara moving forward as he shoots, 
           attacking his target. O’Mara drops his empty mag, his 
           hands alive, intelligent, as he pulls a fresh mag, slams 
           it home, the slide coming forward. Ready to rock again.

                                 KEELER
                        What the hell was that?

                                 O’MARA
                                 (demonstrating)
                        Combat shooting. Square with your 
                        target, weapon in both hands. Keep 
                        throwing lead at him until you put 
                        him down for keeps. It isn’t 
                        pretty, but it works. 

           And we HEAR Xavier Cugat’s MONDONGO over the following 
           rapid-fire scenes...

                                                       INTERCUT AS NEEDED:

           EXT. AGUA DULCE CANYON - DAY AFTER DAY

           BAM! BAM! BAM! Gunsmoke RISING against a red sunset. 
           CASINGS falling in the dirt. Sweat-slick HANDS stripping 
           out empty magazines, reaching for fresh ones, trying to 
           reload, fumbling, dropping full mags into the dust. 
           O’Mara shakes his head. They’re slow, clumsy, inaccurate.

           I/E. BRICK BUILDING (DOWNTOWN) - NIGHT

           The Squad rushes up to a STEEL DOOR. O’Mara leads, 
           carrying a SLEDGEHAMMER, Wooters and Keeler behind him 
           with SHOTGUNS. Ramirez and Washington carry FIRE AXES. 
           Kennard covers their rear flank as O’Mara swings his 
           sledgehammer, SMASHING open the door. And the squad 
           rushes into... ...AN EMPTY ROOM! Nothing. Not even a 
           piece of furniture. O’Mara’s humiliated. Wooters shrugs.

           EXT. AGUA DULCE CANYON - DAY

           BAM! BAM! BAM! Each member of the squad cycles his weapon 
           faster now. They’re shooting on the move, advancing on 
           their targets. Firing to slide-lock, dropping the empty 
           mag and slamming a fresh one into the magazine well. 
           O’Mara’s watching them. They’re more accurate now.
           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           The Squad moves quickly through the dark alley, stacking 
           up at another DOOR. Determined, O’Mara swings his 
           SLEDGEHAMMER, smashing the door. The squad RUSHES into...

           INT. MAHJONG PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

           ...A Mahjong Parlor. Harmless middle-aged CHINESE MEN 
           look up from their mahjong tiles to see six guys with 
           guns. Murmuring in Chinese, they all put their hands up. 
           And O’Mara looks like Charlie Brown missing the football. 

           EXT. AGUA DULCE CANYON - DAY

           O’Mara stands by with a STOPWATCH, sending two man fire-
           teams into the adobe GHOST TOWN. Keeler and Ramirez, 
           Washington and Kennard. *O’Mara has converted the old 
           ghost town into a ‘Hogan’s Alley’ practical combat range.

           INT. BACK-ROOM CASINO - NIGHT

           Raucous CASINO CHATTER. GUYS cat-calling COCKTAIL 
           WAITRESSES slinging drinks like a volunteer fire crew. 
           Neighborhood PIKERS playing roulette, poker, and pool. 
           Feeding quarters into ringing SLOT MACHINES. Dudes 
           crowded around CRAPS TABLES. A GUY in a soup & fish tux 
           playing jazz piano. Every night New Year’s Eve. Cohen’s 
           GOONS on the casino floor. Sharp eyes. Shoulder holsters.

           EXT. AGUA DULCE CANYON - DAY

           Two by two, the squad members move through the maze of 
           crumbling adobe, FIRING at hidden ‘GANGSTERS’ (overcoats 
           stuffed with pillows and sandbags) Fast and smooth.   

           INT. BACK-ROOM CASINO - NIGHT

           Suddenly, the FRONT and REAR DOORS SMASH open and in 
           sweeps The Gangster Squad, moving like a SWAT TEAM. 
           Wooters and Keeler racking shotguns. O’Mara with his 
           pistol in one hand and his sledgehammer in the other. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Everybody grab some sky.

           But Cohen’s GOONS draw their GUNS and the Casino lights 
           up with GUNFIRE. Glasses, bottles, lamps explode. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Plaster punching out from the walls. Gamblers stampeding 
           in every direction, toppling chairs to escape the 
           battering gunfire around them. But the squad remains 
           focused, cool.  

           Keeler FIRES. Two goons duck below the roulette tables, 
           so Keeler VAULTS the railing, drops into the casino pit 
           to FIRE under the tables, taking them out. 

           Another goon fires twin .45s at Wooters. Wooters moves 
           fast, pulling a cute cocktail waitress with him behind a 
           pillar, saving her from the path of gunfire. She gives 
           him a thank-you kiss. And he spins out from behind the 
           pillar, BLASTS the goon backward on to the craps table.

           Kennard sees a goon wielding a SAWED-OFF 12 GAUGE 
           stepping out behind Ramirez, ready to unload both barrels 
           into the kid’s back. With Ramirez between them, Kennard 
           has no shot. But Kennard instantly drops to one knee and 
           FIRES a single round through the inch of space between 
           Ramirez’s armpit and his ribs - the bullet passing close 
           enough to scorch Ramirez’s sleeve - striking the goon 
           dead center. His shotgun firing up into the ceiling.  

           O’Mara and the last remaining goon trading gunfire on the 
           casino floor, shooting and moving - a .45 Caliber kata. 
           Colored chips, playing cards, and tufts of green felt 
           geyser up from the tables around them. Both men firing to 
           slide-lock at the same time, empty. But as the goon 
           crouches to pop a fresh mag into his .45, O’Mara swings 
           the SLEDGEHAMMER into his sternum, knocking him backward 
           off his feet, gasping and croaking on the floor.   

           Washington sees a croupier reaching for the phone on the 
           wall. He THROWS his AXE. The axe WHOOSHES end-over-end 
           through the air to SPLIT the PHONE, embedded in the wall 
           inches from the croupier’s hand. Washington smiles.   

           Kennard glances at the bar mirror and glimpses, reflected 
           in it, a GUY WITH A SHOTGUN crouched behind the bar. 
           Using the mirror, Kennard SHOOTS HOLES IN THE BAR around 
           the guy until he drops his gun, stands with his hands up.

           O’Mara kicks the goon’s gun away and brings his 
           sledgehammer triumphantly down on the roulette table, 
           smashing it with relish. He and Wooters share a smile, 
           watching Ramirez and Washington swing their axes, 
           chopping open the slots, coins spilling over... 
           EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NEON NIGHT

           Conga-line TRAFFIC down the glamorous SUNSET STRIP. 
           Chateau Marmont. Schwab’s Pharmacy. Ciro’s. A LIMOUSINE 
           pulls up under the portico of THE MOCAMBO. WHALEN gets 
           out of the car, opens the door for IGNAZIO “JACK” DRAGNA 
           (58): silver-haired Sicilian “vintner” who ran the 
           rackets for the Black Hand before Cohen moved in, 
           Dragna’s the last remnant of the old guard in LA. 

           INT. THE MOCAMBO - NIGHT

           Carnivale decor. All the walls are GLASS, with real-live 
           PARROTS, MACAWS, and MONKEYS on perches behind them. The 
           dinner crowd salted with stars like SINATRA and LIZ 
           TAYLOR. On the stage: CARMEN MIRANDA and her BAND have 
           the whole place dancing to “South American Way.” We pass 
           JACK WARNER at a booth with RONALD REAGAN & JANE WYMAN. 

           Whalen leads Dragna to a CORNER BOOTH where MICKEY COHEN 
           sits with JEAN. LENNOX stands. But Cohen doesn’t get up. 

                                 COHEN
                        Hiya, Jack.

                                 DRAGNA
                        Mickey.

           There is a fearful symmetry here. Whalen is Dragna’s 
           muscle. Lennox is Cohen’s. Jean in the middle. Tension. 
           Dragna nods Whalen away. Jean gets up to follow him.

                                 JEAN
                        Say boys, if it’s alright with you 
                        I think maybe I’ll bend my elbow, 
                        while you two bend your ears?

           Dragna politely helps her up, then sits down with Cohen.

                                 COHEN
                        There’s a strong-arm crew runnin’ 
                        wild out there. Five, six guys. 
                        Hittin’ me all over town. 

                                 DRAGNA
                        I heard about ‘em. 

                                 COHEN
                        They’re sharp. Maybe ex-military. 
                        And they play pretty rough.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DRAGNA
                        And you think they’re mine?
                        Mickey, you better put on your 
                        listening cap because I’m not in 
                        the habit of repeating myself. I 
                        didn’t hit you. Not once. 
                                 (beat)
                        Maybe they’re from Chicago. Jimmy 
                        Ragan came out here to meet with 
                        you and never came back. You think 
                        they just forgot about him? 

           Cohen laughs. And laughs.

                                 DRAGNA
                        I don’t get you, kid. You had the 
                        world by the ass out here. All the 
                        prestige, purse, and pussy any man 
                        could ask for. And you go and poke 
                        Chicago in the eye. For what? What 
                        the hell is it you want? 

                                 COHEN
                        More.

                                 DRAGNA
                        What’re you up to, Mickey? I know 
                        you bought the Guarantee Finance 
                        Building. That’s my territory. 

                                 COHEN
                        It was.

                                 DRAGNA
                        Listen, there’s a way we’ve always 
                        done things out here-

                                 COHEN
                        -You listen, old man. This ain’t 
                        Chicago. This is the Wild West. 
                        And there’s only one rule out 
                        here. Take what you can when you 
                        can. Spanish took it from the 
                        Injuns. We took it from the 
                        Mexicans. And now, I’m takin’ it 
                        from you, Jack. Because I can.

                                 DRAGNA
                        You know, Mickey, I may be old and 
                        slow, but I have some friends who 
                        are neither.

           EXT. JACK DRAGNA’S VINEYARD - NIGHT

           Dragna’s Tuscan-style ESTATE in the Santa Monica 
           Mountains. MEN IN BLACK moving like wraiths through 
           Dragna’s vineyard, stalking toward his quiet home.

                                 DRAGNA (V.O.)
                        ... If you touch me, they’ll hunt 
                        you down like a dog. If you could 
                        print your own, you’d still never 
                        come up with enough money to buy 
                        your life from them.

                                 COHEN
                        You wanna bet?

           Dragna stands, turns his back on Cohen, and heads for the 
           door. Whalen downs his drink, nods to Jean, follows him.

           EXT. JACK DRAGNA’S VINEYARD - NIGHT

           The MEN IN BLACK close on the house, grotesque monsters, 
           huge eyes, proboscis snouts. They’re wearing GAS MASKS, 
           carrying M-3 GREASE GUNS fitted with suppressors. The men 
           pull SMOKE GRENADES and toss them. Grenades SMASH through 
           windows, hissing, and the house fills with colored smoke.

           INT. DRAGNA’S ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           Dragna’s armed BODYGUARDS cough and scramble, blinded by 
           smoke. While the masked men in black move through the 
           swirling smoke like sharks through water, firing their 
           silenced M-3s. Pfft-pfft-pfft-pfft! Percussive whispers.

           Jack Dragna hustles his WIFE down the hall, holding a 
           towel over her mouth to protect her from the smoke, 
           stepping over the bodies of his men, trying to escape.

           They run right into a man in a gas mask. She SCREAMS 
           through the towel as he raises his M-3. Pfft-Pfft! 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Smoke clears. Standing over the bodies of Dragna and his 
           wife, the gunman removes his gas mask. We see it’s 
           Lennox.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. AGUA DULCE CANYON - DAY

           The squad cleans their guns on the hoods of their FORDS, 
           trunks full of AMMO BOXES and EASTSIDE BEER. They pass 
           around a church-key can opener, sipping cold beer while 
           reloading their pistols. Kennard leans against a car.

                        I guess Hoppalong here doesn’t 
                        have to practice with the rest of 
                        us.

           In response, Kennard tosses his empty CAN into the air, 
           DRAWS his revolver in one blurring motion, FIRES - BOOM! - 
           kicking the can further up in the air. Moving forward, 
           Kennard FIRES again - BOOM! - and hits the spinning can. 
           Walking swift and calm, Kennard FIRES and FIRES, keeping 
           the can aloft, bouncing it skyward with all six bullets. 
           Kennard plucks another empty CAN off the hood of a Ford.  

                                 KENNARD
                        Get on up here, Navidad. 

           Ramirez now stands up on the firing line, hand on his 
           gun, anxious as Kennard TOSSES the CAN. Ramirez draws, 
           FIRES. BOOM! Miss. Kennard tosses again. BOOM! Miss. 
           Again. BOOM! Miss. Again. Chuckles from the squad.

                                 KENNARD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t shoot where it is, son. 
                        Shoot where it’s gonna be.

           Determined, Ramirez holsters a final time. Kennard TOSSES 
           the CAN. Ramirez FIRES. BOOM! BOOM! But he can’t get it.

           Now, Washington steps forward and hands Kennard an empty 
           can. He nods and Kennard TOSSES the CAN skyward. But 
           instead of pulling his gun, Washington lets his 
           SWITCHBLADE drop from his sleeve into his palm, thumbing 
           the button -shickt- and THROWS the knife. The can just 
           disappears. Then the CAN suddenly reappears, CRUSHED 
           against the throat of one of the PAPER TARGETS, pinned 
           there by the switchblade. Washington smiles at Kennard. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           O’Mara and Wooters stand a little apart from the others, 
           talking strategy...

                                 WOOTERS
                        Have you given any thought to our 
                        time limit here, Sarge?
                                 (off O’Mara)
                        There is one, you know. ‘Cause we 
                        could hit a dozen casinos without 
                        seriously disrupting his 
                        operation. I mean Cohen’ll hardly 
                        feel it, but that doesn’t mean 
                        he’s going to take it lying down.

                                 O’MARA
                        Cohen’s gonna come lookin’ for us. 
                        I know. But there’s nothin’ for 
                        it, Jerry. We just have to shut 
                        him down before he finds us. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Well, if you want to do that we’re 
                        going to have to get in his head.

           I/E. COHEN’S MANSION (HOLLYWOOD HILLS) - NIGHT

           Mickey Cohen’s MANSION: mission architecture, borrowed 
           class bristling with artillery. Powerful FLASHLIGHTS 
           sweep over the grounds as SENTRIES patrol the perimeter 
           with GERMAN SHEPHERDS on short leashes, CARBINES. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - CONTINUOUS

           O’Mara, Wooters, and Keeler crouch. They’re wearing all 
           black. Applying charcoal to their faces. Tense.

                                 KEELER
                                 (to Wooters)
                        You sure about this?

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Callin’ this crazy would be an 
                        insult to crazy people.

           Above them, lying panther-like on the branch of a banyan 
           tree, Kennard PEERS through a HUGE M1 SNIPER SCOPE, an 
           INFRARED LIGHT attached to the bottom of his rifle. 
           *First-generation NIGHT VISION brought back from the war.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KENNARD 
                        Ain’t you gonna help ‘em with 
                        that, Washington?

                                 WASHINGTON
                        You’re a real charmer, cowboy.

           Washington crouches at the base of the tree, an SCR-536 
           HANDHELD TRANSCEIVER to his ear. These guys are still 
           dressed like characters out of a Chandler novel, but they 
           move like modern commandos.

           KENNARD’S POV (THROUGH NIGHTVISION):

           A green-tinted image of the SENTRIES making their rounds.

                                 KENNARD
                        Takes them boys about three 
                        minutes to make it around the 
                        house. You’ll have to rawhide it.

           O’Mara pulls a bottle of AMMONIA, and sprinkling all 
           three of them with it. It stinks to high heaven. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        How’s this gonna throw off the 
                        dogs? We just stink of ammonia.

                                 O’MARA
                        I don’t know, it worked in France.

           Keeler and Wooters share a look. Christ. 

                                 KENNARD 
                        Well, it’s workin’ on me. Shoo. 
                        Why don’t you boys get a goin’.

           O’Mara, Wooters, and Keeler shoulder their SATCHELS.

           EXT. BOTTOM OF THE HILL - NIGHT

           Ramirez waits in one of the Ford Sheridans, parked under 
           an oak tree, watching the road for headlights. He 
           receives Washington’s transmission on a matching 536.

           INT. CULVERT - CONTINUOUS

           O’Mara leads the three of them crawling through the 
           narrow culvert toward the dim circle of moonlight at the 
           other end. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Then O’Mara stops near the mouth of the culvert, mouth-
           breathing, watching as the SENTRIES’ FLASHLIGHTS BEAMS 
           pass over the corrugated steel opening. 

           A GERMAN SHEPHERD suddenly fills the mouth of the 
           culvert, blocking the light, sniffing. The dog’s head and 
           shoulders inside. THE DOG LOOKS DIRECTLY AT O’MARA, 
           sniffs, dismisses him and moves away from the culvert. 

           O’Mara, Wooters, and Keeler ninja-creep across the lawn, 
           crouch at the side of the house and POP the SCREEN off 
           the crawl-space. Wooters and Keeler slip under the house. 
           O’Mara waits by the opening, keeping watch for sentries. 

           Wooters and Keeler CRAWL through the dirt to where a 
           sliver of LIGHT comes down through the seams around the 
           ACCESS PANEL from the crawl space to the house.

           INT. HALL CLOSET (COHEN’S MANSION) - CONTINUOUS

           Wooters silently opens the panel and pops out. Keeler 
           follows. Wooters cracks the closet door, peering out. 

           At the end of the hall, GUNMEN sit, smoking, watching the 
           windows, CARBINES lean against their chairs. Three of 
           them playing cards. If any of them looked back, they’d 
           see Wooters and Keeler dashing into the MASTER BEDROOM. 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Keeler opens his satchel, unfurls his canvas tool kit on 
           Cohen’s bed. Wooters watches the hall while Keeler 
           unscrews the back of Cohen’s new EMERSON TELEVISION.

           I/E. FORD SHERIDAN - NIGHT

           Ramirez shifts and fidgets. He has to pee. Finally, he 
           gets out of the car and runs down into a gully, unzips.

           KENNARD’S POV (THROUGH NIGHTVISION):

           The SENTRIES with their dogs are halfway around the house 
           now, heading back toward O’Mara.

                                 KENNARD
                        The hell’s takin’ so long?
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wooters watches Keeler fit a state-of-the-art BUG with a 
           transmitter and microphone into the back of the TV.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

           Cohen’s 1948 Packard Custom 8 LIMO heads up his street.

           I/E. COHEN’S LIMO - NIGHT

           The DRIVER takes them up familiar switchbacks. COHEN in 
           back with JEAN. Cohen’s silent, seething, distracted.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

           Ramirez is zipping up when the headlights hit his back. 
           He crouches in the gully as Cohen’s limo PASSES, then 
           scrambles up out of the gully to the car. IT’S LOCKED! 
           The keys left dangling from the ignition. His walkie-
           talkie on the passenger seat!

           KENNARD’S POV (THROUGH NIGHTVISION):

           The guard is coming around, heading right for O’Mara!

                                 KENNARD
                        Guard’s gonna be right on top of 
                        him. I’m takin’ him now. 

           EXT. COHEN’S MANSION - NIGHT

           O’Mara sees the guard coming now, he pulls his pistol.

                                 WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        Hold it. Hold it.

           I/E. FORD SHERIDAN - NIGHT

           Ramirez SMASHES his window with a ROCK, grabs the walkie.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        He’s coming back! Repeat. Cohen’s 
                        on his way back to the house!
           EXT. COHEN’S MANSION - NIGHT

           O’Mara crouches, pointing his pistol at the approaching 
           guard, who still hasn’t seen him. He HEARS Washington’s 
           HOOT-OWL call across the canyon. The guard and his dog 
           TURN at the sound. Just then, TIRES crunch up the gravel 
           driveway. Headlights. Cohen’s LIMO has returned. The 
           guard does an about-face and heads out to greet Cohen.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           They HEAR the FRONT DOOR now. Keeler’s fingers fly, 
           screwing the panel back on the TV, dropping the last 
           screw, picking it up, screwing it in, as Wooters GRABS 
           Keeler and YANKS him out.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Men taking Cohen’s coat. Cohen heads to the kitchen. But 
           Jean heads back toward the bedroom to powder her nose. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Keeler RUNS across the hall, drops into the crawlspace. 
           Wooters glances back, sees Keeler’s TOOLS left on the 
           bed! He grabs them and RUSHES back into the hall- 

           -and RUNS RIGHT INTO JEAN!!! She doesn’t scream, but it’s 
           a near thing. They just stare at each other. Wooters puts 
           his fingers to his lips. A moment. All she has to do is 
           shout. But he can’t help himself. He gives her a quick 
           kiss. She waves him into the crawlspace. Closing the 
           closet door behind him, delicious smile on her red lips.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. BURBANK AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Wheels BARK against the runway as a LOCKHEED SUPER 
           ELECTRA touches down. A TOWER SEARCHLIGHT swings over a 
           backwater BURBANK AIRPORT. Mothballed B-17s and P-38s in 
           front of Quonset HANGARS. BURBANK COPS on horseback clop 
           along the PERIMETER FENCE, shotguns across their pommels.
           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Lying prone in a field between the airport and HOLLYWOOD 
           WAY, O’Mara PEERS at the plane through the M1 SCOPE. Next 
           to him, Wooters holds his SCR-536 walkie-talkie.

           O’MARA’S POV (THROUGH NIGHTVISION):

           The GROUND CREW chocking the wheels of the Super Electra. 
           The CARGO DOOR opens. A dozen more BURBANK COPS standing 
           guard around the plane.

                                 O’MARA
                        Here they come. Right on schedule.

                                 WOOTERS (INTO 536)
                        You still think planting that wire 
                        was nuts?

                                 WASHINGTON
                                 (over radio)
                        Yes.

           EXT. SUPER ELECTRA - NIGHT

           A CONVOY approaches the plane. Two PACKARDS leading a 3/4 
           Ton Canvas-topped DODGE TRUCK. Cohen’s MEN climb out of 
           them and begin off-loading heavy BUNDLES from the plane. 
           Cohen’s lieutenant, CORWIN GRIMES supervises. Grimes has 
           a military bearing. And a murderous gleam.

           I/E. BOTH FORD SHERIDANS (MOVING) - NIGHT

           The FORD SHERIDANS are transformed, gleaming, sleek, 
           stalking the Packards at a distance. O’Mara driving 
           Wooters and Keeler in the lead car. Ramirez driving 
           Washington and Kennard in the other. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                                 (to Ramirez)
                        How the hell’d you fix up these 
                        cars so damn fast?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        My cousin.

                                 KENNARD
                        Where’d he get all the parts?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        His cousin.

                        Stand by until they cross the 
                        river into LA. We don’t need 
                        another dance with Burbank PD.

           The Squad follows the CONVOY, lead by two BURBANK COPS on 
           MOTORCYCLES. A BURBANK PD PROWL CAR. And the two 
           Packards. The burbank cops peel off as the Convoy turns 
           onto rural SAN FERNANDO ROAD, lined with FARMS, FILLING 
           STATIONS, a few HOMES. 

                                 O’MARA (CONT’D)
                        Okay, take ‘em.

           The supercharged SHERIDANS accelerate after the Convoy.

           I/E. PACKARD (FAST) - CONTINUOUS

           Grimes sees the FORDS coming up in his REARVIEW. But 
           instead of flooring it to escape, he lets up on the gas, 
           dropping back to cover the dope-loaded Packard’s escape. 

                                 GRIMES
                        We just picked up a couple a tics. 
                        Burn ‘em off the road.

           Grimes SLAMS on this breaks, a controlled four-wheel 
           drift, letting the two Fords roar past him. The gunmen 
           with him leans out the window with his Carbine, FIRING. 

           I/E. WASHINGTON’S FORD - CONTINUOUS

           BAM! BAM! BAM! Washington, Kennard, and Ramirez all duck 
           as gunfire punches through their fender. Washington 
           CRANKS the wheel to the left, takes his Ford off-road 
           into a CORNFIELD. STALKS breaking over the GRILL, 
           whipping the windshield, as they drive. 

           Grimes drives after them. Another Packard breaks off to 
           follow. The two Packards pursuing Washington’s Ford like 
           orca swimming through the tall corn, gunmen FIRING. 

           Kennard leans out the window, FIRING back, his rounds 
           punching through the windshield, killing the other 
           driver, his car swerving into Grimes’ Packard, taking 
           both cars out of the game. Grimes’ car on it’s side.

                                 GRIMES
                        Son of a bitch!
           I/E. O’MARA’S FORD (FAST) - CONTINUOUS

           O’Mara POURS IT ON, determined. Wooters draws his .45. 
           Closing on them, Wooters leans out his open passenger

           Gunman 2 climbs over into the backseat and opens the WINE 
           CRATE resting there. Inside the slots meant for wine 
           bottles are a dozen Model 24 Stielhandgranate POTATO 
           MASHER GRENADES. The gunman pulls one out, rolls down his 
           window and YANKS the pull cord, igniting the FUSE.

           I/E. O’MARA’S FORD (FAST) - CONTINUOUS

           O’Mara see the gunman’s torso pop out of the Packard’s 
           back window, his arm cocked, tossing the-

           Oh, you gotta be-
                                              -Grenade!

           O’Mara SWERVES up on to the shoulder as the potato masher 
           tomahawks through the night air to - plink! - bounce 
           along the road past his car, EXPLODING just behind them.

                                 KEELER
                        Jesus! We’re pulling off, right?

                        Right?

           Wooters looks to O’Mara, who shakes his head.

           Gunman 2 SIDE-ARMS the next grenade. This one LANDS - 
           CLANG! - RIGHT ON THEIR HOOD, rolling down into the well 
           between the wipers and windshield! Wooters and O’Mara 
           exchange HOLY-SHIT looks. O’Mara SLAMS the brakes, the 
           car SPINNING OUT with Wooters hooking his arm around from 
           his open window, fingers scrabble the hood for the 
           grenade, but he can’t reach it! 

           Wooters ducks back inside the car - BANG! BANG! - FIRES 
           his .45 out through the windshield - PUNCHES his arm out 
           through the bullet-broken glass windshield, fingers 
           closing around the grenade. He FLINGS it away. The 
           grenade EXPLODES mid-air as their car rockets past it.

           I/E. PACKARD - CONTINUOUS

           Holding them in his fingers like a juggler, the gunman 
           now PULLS the CORDS on TWO GRENADES at once. He’s about 
           to throw them-

           -when WASHINGTON’S FORD blasts out of the cornfield, 
           trailing broken cornstalks, barreling right at them. 

                                 GUNMAN
                        Holy-

           And Washington RAMS into the Packard, jarring both 
           grenades from the gunman’s fingers. The gunman 
           frantically tries to pick them up off the floor-

           -but he’s not quick enough. KABOOM! The explosion PUNTS 
           the Packard into the night sky like a coffee can with a 
           cherry bomb under it. O’Mara DRIVES under the flaming car 
           before it CRASHES back in a fiery heap on San Fernando.

           O’Mara’s POURING it on, determined to catch that TRUCK.

           The squad’s two Fords finally close in on the TRUCK and 
           force it off the road, down into the LA RIVER. The TRUCK 
           rolling end over end, spilling bundles of powder-

           Both cars pull into a quiet dirt turnout overlooking LA. 
           O’Mara gets out of his car and OPENS his TRUNK. Two THUGS 
           crammed back there - a bloody mess, but alive. 

                                 O’MARA

           The men limp to the shoulder, overlooking Los Angeles.

                        you get the damnedest hay fever.

           O’Mara moves his revolver to the left and FIRES! BOOM! 
           Inches from the thug’s ear, shattering his eardrum. The 
           thug writhes on the ground, clutching his ear. Screaming.

                                 KEELER
                        JESUS CHRIST!

           He puts his pistol to the back of Thug 2’s head. Keeler 
           moves to intervene. But Washington grabs Keeler’s arm. 

                                 O’MARA
                        How about you? You got hay fever?

           Wooters grabs O’Mara’s shoulder. O’Mara shrugs him off.

                        Letty, you’re the tops.

           Cohen lets Letty tuck a napkin under his chin. She leaves 
           as Lennox enters with Grimes. Grimes looks terrified.

           A moment. Cohen removes the napkin from under his chin,

           FRENCH DOORS. Cohen stepping outside over broken glass.

           Grimes stands, wobbly, tries to run. Cohen takes him 
           apart with a savage combination, knocking Grimes into the

           thumbs pressing into his Adam’s apple, holding his head 
           underwater while carp dart around him. Bubble screams. 
           The bubbles stop. Grimes’ face slack underwater. Dead. 
           Cohen stands, shaking water from his hands. Calm now. 
           Cohen pauses, stretches, then lifts his robe to piss into

           cookout. Bottles of beer on the picnic table. Keeler’s 
           wife Marcia and his son Charlie are there. Laughing and 
           talking, the guys watch little Charlie running patterns, 
           Ramirez tossing him the football. O’Mara notices Keeler 
           off to the side talking to Wooters. He’s not happy.

           Connie leads Officer Gates into the backyard. Gates is 
           carrying two sacks full of groceries. Steaks wrapped in 
           butcher paper. More cold beer. The squad gathers around.

           thick with palms and banana trees. FAMILIES everywhere.

           Wooters and Jean stroll past KIDS holding baby alligators 
           sold here as pets. Some of the bigger gators are fitted 
           with muzzles, saddles. Kids actually riding them.

           A TRAINER coaxing gators to ‘chute the chutes’ for the 
           guests. The creatures climb plank-stairs up to a yellow

           I/E. GUARANTEE FINANCE BUILDING (WEST HOLLYWOOD) - DAY

           Cohen walks Sheriff Biscailuz, Lennox, and an entourage 
           of ‘INVESTORS’ through his newly-acquired GUARANTEE 
           FINANCE BUILDING: art-deco with an air of legitimacy. 

                                 COHEN
                        May not look like much now. But 
                        this is Shangri-La. El Dorado. 
                        People won’t need to go to Vegas. 
                        I’ll bring the action to them, 
                        right here, in the most beautiful 
                        city in the goddamned world.

           The building’s still empty, but MOVERS are hauling in 
           furniture. ELECTRICIANS pulling wire. And Cohen sees the 
           possibilities here. He’s like a man possessed.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 COHEN
                        This, right here where we’re 
                        standin, will be the Central 
                        Sports Book for the Western United 
                        States. 

           But the implications make the men around him nervous.

                                 SHERIFF BISCAILUZ
                        What about Chicago? The Syndicate?

                                 COHEN
                        They’re the past. We’re livin’ in 
                        the atomic age now. We got a bomb 
                        can cook a city in less time than 
                        it takes me to tell you about it. 
                        Hell, they’re buildin’ jet 
                        fighters right here in El Segundo 
                        that’ll run faster than the speed 
                        of sound. 
                                 (off their looks)
                        This is the future.

           INT. CHIEF PARKER’S OFFICE (LAPD HEADQUARTERS) - DAY

           Gates leads O’Mara into Chief Parker’s office. The Chief 
           stands with his back to the room, looking out his window 
           at Los Angeles. He holds O’Mara’s PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.

                                 O’MARA
                                 (clears his throat)
                        You wanted to see me, sir?

                                 PARKER
                        I’ve just received your 
                        performance evaluation from 
                        Bunco/Forgery. Apparently, you are 
                        rarely at your desk, Sergeant. 

                                 O’MARA
                                 (playing along)
                        Well, the crooks are out there, 
                        sir... Most of them anyway.

                                 PARKER
                        Indeed. 

           Parker points to the NEWSPAPERS fanned out on his desk. 
           The Los Angeles Times. The Los Angeles Herald. The Daily 
           News. Headlines like, MYSTERY MEN STRIKE AT MICKEY COHEN. 
           NEW FORCE IN LA UNDERWORLD. GANGSTERS OR VIGILANTES?  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 PARKER
                        Take these troublesome characters 
                        for instance. What they’re doing 
                        is against the law. And yet these 
                        violent men have done more damage 
                        to Mickey Cohen than anyone under 
                        my command. I should have them 
                        arrested, of course. But as long 
                        no one knows who they are, I 
                        remain helpless to do so.    

           Parker strikes a MATCH against his desk and sets FIRE to 
           O’Mara’s PERFORMANCE EVALUATION. O’Mara watches him drop 
           the blackening pages into his wastebasket. Gates smiles.

                                 PARKER
                        Carry on, Sergeant.

           INT. CLIFTON’S CAFETERIA - DAY

           We HEAR Danny Kaye and the Andrews Sisters’ Civilization. 
           Indoor waterfalls. Faux-palm trees with neon. The BOOTHS 
           are Polynesian grass huts. Strobe ‘lightning’ and 
           recorded ‘thunder’ announce a tropical storm. It RAINS 
           inside the restaurant. WOOTERS and JEAN are having lunch 
           in a grass-topped booth. 

                                 JEAN
                        What do you suggest, Jerry? I’ve 
                        got a few frocks and three 
                        thousand bucks in a coffee can. 
                        That’s not gonna get me very far.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Make your choice. It’s me or him.

                                 JEAN
                        I’m sorry.

           Morose. Wooters pours cream into his coffee, then pops 
           the hinged LID of the little stainless steel cream 
           PITCHER. Wooters steers the lid, scanning the restaurant 
           until he catches the reflection of JOE SICA and his big 
           brother FRED. Syndicate Enforcers out here from Chicago.

                                 WOOTERS 
                        He had you tailed.

                                 JEAN
                        I don’t recognize them.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The Sicas arrive at the table, the kind of guys who were 
           shaving by the fourth grade and holding up liquor stores 
           by the fifth. Jerry’s hand drops under the table, but 
           they don’t seem interested in him. They leer at Jean.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Can I help you with something?

                                 JOE SICA
                        Mind your business. We’ll get to 
                        you in a minute. 

                                 FRED SICA
                        We just want to talk to her is 
                        all. We got a message for Mr. 
                        Cohen... From Chicago.

           Fred’s HAND now drops into his JACKET POCKET for 
           something. Wooters STANDS now.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Well, I don’t think the lady wants 
                        to talk to you.

                                 FRED SICA
                        What lady? She’s just one a 
                        Mickey’s pro skirts, pal.

           Wooters left hand flashes out, CHOPPING FRED’S THROAT. He 
           GAGS, going down. 

           Wooters DUCKS under Joe’s PUNCH, his right hand now 
           coming up with his .45, swinging the pistol like a gama, 
           the stainless steel handle crunching his nose, as Jerry 
           twirls the swinging pistol into firing position.

           Both thugs on the floor. Wooters standing over them, 
           finger on his trigger, chest-heaving. He reaches into 
           Fred’s jacket where his hand was a second ago. Pulls out 
           a SQUEEZE BOTTLE. Jerry sniffs the bottle, frowns. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Acid. 

           Wooters points the bottle toward them. Both men RAISE 
           their hands, instinctively covering their faces. But 
           Wooters SQUEEZES the bottle out over both their CROTCHES. 
           Thin smoke rising from their trousers as the ACID hits 
           them. And they suddenly move like they’re on fire, 
           crabbing away, fumbling their belts, wriggling, 
           scrambling out of their trousers, until they’re sitting 
           on their bare asses on the floor of the restaurant. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        near her again, I’ll kill ya.

           Jean stares, seeing Jerry Wooters for the first time.

                                 WOOTERS
                        What? You never had a man fight 
                        over you before?

                                 JEAN
                        Over me. But never for me. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Come on. I’ll take you home.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - THE NEXT DAY

           On the mesa, two-hundred yards above Cohen’s Mansion, 
           O’Mara parks his FORD SHERIDAN in the shade well down the 
           block from a HALF-FINISHED HOME with a FOR SALE sign. 
           O’Mara gets out and heads up to the house, carrying a 
           grocery sack. He pulls aside a section of tarp on the 
           house, like a curtain, and steps inside. 

           INT. ABANDONED HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Keeler has converted one of the finished rooms into his 
           FIELD OFFICE. His LISTENING EQUIPMENT arrayed neatly, a 
           military-grade RECEIVER, and his Minifon portable WIRE 
           RECORDER, REELS SPINNING as he records conversations.

                                 KEELER
                        So far today I’ve learned that 
                        Johnny Stomp is balling Lana 
                        Turner. And Frank Sinatra sounds 
                        pretty sore about it.

                                 O’MARA
                        I’m pretty sore about it myself. 
                        Anything else?

                                 KEELER
                        Judge Krauss is a world-class 
                        whoremonger. Bastard can’t get 
                        enough of Cohen’s girls. 

           O’Mara places the sack on the desk. Keeler reaches in, 
           pulls butcher paper off an egg salad sandwich and hands 
           half of the sandwich back to O’Mara. Two bottles of coke.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

           Keeler hands O’Mara an earpiece.

                                 COHEN (OVER WIRE)
                        ...Well, somebody knows who these 
                        sons of bitches are. They’re not 
                        local. So somebody’s gotta be 
                        harborin’ ‘em out here. Check the 
                        hotels. The YMCA. I don’t care if 
                        you have to burn the whole damn 
                        city down. But I don’t want them 
                        anywhere near Guarantee Finance.

           O’Mara and Keeler share a look.

           EXT. GUARANTEE FINANCE BUILDING (WEST HOLLYWOOD) - DAY

           A runner pulls his 1948 Chevy Fleetmaster Woody in front 
           of the GUARANTEE FINANCE BUILDING. 

           Parked across the street, WOOTERS and O’MARA watch the 
           runner disappear through REVOLVING DOORS. O’Mara and 
           Wooters watch RUNNERS come and go, like bees returning to 
           the hive. We get a sense of scope and scale.

           THEATER ROOFTOP - NIGHT 

           Across the street from Guarantee Finance, O’Mara, Wooters 
           and Keeler crouch behind a NEON marquee. From here, they 
           can see both the FRONT and the LOADING BAY at the rear. 
           At the bay, menacing MEN supervise Brinks SECURITY GUARDS 
           loading locked CANVAS BAGS onto a BRINKS TRUCK.

           Keeler scans the bundle of WIRES running from telephone 
           poles to the rooftop of Guarantee Finance. 

                                 KEELER
                        Okay. Those two look like they’re 
                        incoming. 
                                 (spying a third)
                        But THAT one’s definitely 
                        outgoing. And I bet it doesn’t 
                        ring to the cops. 
                                 (to O’Mara)
                        You sure about this one, Sarge? No 
                        way do we pull one this big and 
                        stay secret. It might get kinda 
                        hard to stay alive around here.

                        I want you all to understand 
                        something. We do this, we’ll be 
                        exposed. There’s no way around it. 
                        Cohen will find out who hit him. 
                        And he’ll come after us. And we’ll 
                        be six guys up against an army.

                        Not just strong-arm boys either. 
                        I’m talkin’ about trained killers 
                        packin’ military hardware. I’ve 
                        seen firsthand what those weapons 
                        will do to a man.

           Off Ramirez, hiding his fear. 

                                 O’MARA
                        This is further than I asked any 
                        of you to go. And I won’t fault 
                        anyone who wants out now. 

           The men exchange looks. Wordless promises to stand 
           together. Ready to step into the breach together.

                        will handle the third. Keeler’s on 
                        the roof to cut the silent alarm. 

           EXT. TELEPHONE POLE - EVENING

           Keeler, dressed as a Pacific Bell worker, climbs the pole 
           next to the Guarantee Finance Building like a lumberjack.

                                 O’MARA
                        When the shooting starts, I figure 
                        we’re going to have about five 
                        minutes to un-ass the location 
                        before the Sheriffs respond.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        What about me, Sarge?

                                 KENNARD
                        You’re gonna mind the horses.

           Off Ramirez, seriously bummed.

           EXT. MUSSO & FRANKS - THE NEXT DAY

           A RUNNER, sunglasses and bomber jacket, strolls out and 
           climbs into his CHEVROLET WOODY. 

                                 O’MARA (V.O.)
                        We go at seventeen hundred. 

           Keeler looks down ninety feet to pedestrians on the 
           sidewalk. He GRIPS the WIRE, crossing his legs around it, 
           to pull himself along the wire toward the roof of GF.

           But as the runner starts the car, O’MARA sits up out of 
           the backseat, his PISTOL pressed to the back of the 
           runner’s head. Smiling into the rearview mirror. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Don’t mind me. Just drive.

           EXT. GUARANTEE FINANCE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Parked down the street from the building, Wooters, 
           Kennard, and Ramirez wait in their Ford Sheridan. 

           I/E. FORD SHERIDAN

           Ramirez behind the wheel. Next to him, Kennard picks his 
           teeth, cactus calm. Wooters and Washington in back.

                        The building’s on fire.

           Wooters passes Washington a TIN of SHELL LIGHTER FLUID as 
           they watch the Woody pull up to Guarantee Finance. The 
           ‘runner’ gets out of his Woody, wearing his sunglasses, 
           bomber jacket, heads through the REVOLVING DOORS. 

           Keeler lands lightly on the gravel roof, jogs across to 
           the bundle of wires, pulls his bolt-cutters-

           INT. GUARANTEE FINANCE BUILDING (LOBBY) - CONTINUOUS

           The ‘runner’ steps inside and approaches the DOORMAN -

                                 DOORMAN
                        You’re early.

           -The doorman now SEES it’s O’MARA behind the sunglasses-

                                 DOORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, who the f-

           The doorman reaches down to push the HIDDEN BUTTON under 
           his desk-

           -As KEELER SNIPS the SILENT ALARM. Satisfying sparks.

           -the doorman pulls his PISTOL! But before he can clear 
           his holster, O’Mara cracks his jaw with the butt of his 
           WALTHER P38 (with suppressor), cold-cocking the doorman. 

           O’Mara is dragging the unconscious doorman out of sight 
           when three other GUARDS walk in. They see him, pulling 
           their guns. O’Mara doesn’t hesitate. He raises his P38. 
           Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Killing three men in two seconds flat. 

           I/E. FORD SHERIDAN - CONTINUOUS

           Kennard turns to Ramirez, deadly serious now.

                                 KENNARD
                        Under no circumstances are you to 
                        exit this vehicle, get me?

                        Yes, sir.

           Wooters, Kennard, and Washington jog across the street 
           and follow O’Mara into the Guarantee Finance building.

           INT. GUARANTEE FINANCE 

           O’Mara finishes handcuffing the doorman as Wooters, 
           Kennard, and Washington step inside, seeing the bodies. 

                                 KENNARD
                        God-damn.

           Wooters tosses an ITHACA SHOTGUN across the lobby. O’Mara 
           CATCHES the weapon, RACKS the action without breaking 
           stride as the four men Wild-Bunch charge up the wide 
           MARBLE STAIRCASE. O’Mara SIGNALS to Kennard and 
           Washington to PEEL OFF to the SECOND FLOOR.

           INT. GUARANTEE FINANCE (SECOND FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS

           Kennard and Washington enter a HUGE ROOM. Awestruck. It’s 
           like the phone company. FEMALE OPERATORS. SWITCHBOARDS.

                                                       OPERATOR 2
                          OPERATOR 1
           Guarantee Finance.
                                              Fifty on 637? You got it.

           The Operators SCRIBBLE NAMES, NUMBERS, INCOMING BETS from 
           all over Southern California. And place the SLIPS into 
           LAMSON CYLINDERS, which they feed into PNEUMATIC TUBES.

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Pardon me. Ladies. LADIES! May we 
                        have your attention please?

           Forty operators look up from their switchboards, seeing 
           Kennard and Washington, their guns. What the hell? 

                                 KENNARD
                        Y’all can take the rest of the day 
                        off. Have a good one.

           INT. THIRD FLOOR (LANDING) - CONTINUOUS 

           O’Mara and Wooters peer around the corner, awed by...
           INT. THIRD FLOOR (COUNTING ROOM) - CONTINUOUS

           Cohen’s Counting Room, Holy of Holies: Row upon row of 
           heavy steel TANKER DESKS, a Kafka sea of them across a 
           room as big as a basketball court. COUNTERS sitting at 
           each desk, raw fingers flipping thousands of dollars.

           Wooters and O’Mara watch them bundle the BILLS and place 
           them into canvas bags. The bags carted to an industrial 
           FREIGHT ELEVATOR big enough for a garbage truck. 

           Prowling the perimeter of the counting room are EIGHT of 
           Cohen’s FLOORMEN, watchdogs, scanning each desk for any 
           slight of hand. Each floorman wears an ARMY .45 in a 
           holster and a STEN Mark II submachine gun, with a side-
           mounted 32-round mag, slung on a shoulder strap.  

                                 WOOTERS
                                 (whispering)
                        We’re outgunned, Kemosabe.

                                 O’MARA
                        You’re the one who said you wanted 
                        to do something dumb. 
                                 (smiling)
                        I can’t think of anything dumber 
                        than this.

           A MAN pushes a CART full of CANVAS BAGS past O’Mara and 
           Wooters. He glances to his left and SEES THEM! O’Mara 
           CLAPS one hand over the man’s mouth and hooks the other 
           arm around his throat, choking him unconscious. 

           O’Mara drags the man around the corner. And Wooters pulls 
           the CART out into the LANDING. Unsnaps one of the canvas 
           bags. O’Mara sees the THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BUNDLED 
           INSIDE: New homes. A new start. O’Mara and Wooters look 
           like Frodo gazing upon the ring. This is Cohen’s might. 
           Not machine guns, but the promise of everything you’ve 
           ever wanted...

                                 O’MARA
                        Do it.

           Wooters pulls his bottle of lighter fluid...

                                 WOOTERS
                        And you couldn’t think of anything 
                        dumber.

           ...and DOUSES ALL THE MONEY in the cart! 
           INT. SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Operators hustle to the stairwell, head downstairs.

                        Quietly, ladies, if you please.

           As Kennard and Washington step into the SORTING ROOM ...

           INT. SECOND FLOOR (SORTING ROOM) - CONTINUOUS

           ... Where CYLINDERS drop from PNEUMATIC TUBES. MEN 
           scramble up/down track-rolling, library LADDERS pinning 
           each BETTING SLIP to a gigantic, TOTALISATOR BOARD. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Everybody out. Nice and quiet.

           Washington pulls his TIN of Shell lighter fluid, SQUIRTS 
           fluid across the papered TOTALISATOR BOARD. The board 
           becomes a WALL OF FLAME. Betting slips blacken, peel away 
           to REVEAL a hidden panel behind the totalisator board, a 
           SECRET DOOR with a speakeasy EYE-SLIT. Now, the EYE-SLIT 
           slides open, a pair of EYES behind it stare right at him!

                                 KENNARD
                        Oh shit.

           Kennard pulls Washington out of the way just as a dozen 
           BULLETS PUNCH OUT THROUGH THE DOOR. The door KICKS open 
           and FOUR GUNMEN with MAUSERS come out BLASTING. 

           Kennard FIRES, hits the first guy dead center, dropping 
           him. Washington SHOVES a ladder, sending it rolling along 
           its track, knocking a guy sideways, fouling his aim. 
           Kennard plugs another guy as he and Washington retreat to 
           the stairwell, FIRE SPREADING FAST UP THE WALLS!

           INT. THIRD FLOOR (COUNTING ROOM) - CONTINUOUS

           O’Mara and Wooters hear gunfire coming from downstairs. 
           The FLOORMEN hear it too and hit the ALARM on the wall.

           Ready?
                                              Hell no.

           Wooters LIGHTS the MONEY and he and O’Mara SHOVE the 
           FLAMING CART out into the COUNTING ROOM!

           CONTINUED:

           Panicked COUNTERS leave their desks, stampede for the 
           exit. But one counter can’t resist GRABBING a canvas sack 
           on his way out. A floorman SEES him - BAM! - puts one 
           between the thief’s shoulder blades. Rules are rules. 

           And O’Mara and Wooters charge out into the counting room, 
           Ithaca Shotguns up, Butch and Sundance BLASTING fast as 
           they can PUMP out twelve-gauge shells. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 

           The floormen unsling their STEN submachine guns, and - 
           brackabrackabrackbra! - UNLEASH a devastating field of 
           fire across the counting room. Bullets whizzing like 
           particles in a super collider. Desk lamps EXPLODE. Canvas 
           sacks burst open, kicking money into the air. 

           The tanker desks are the only cover available in the open 
           room. Wooters and O’Mara low-crawl through rows and rows 
           of them, crouching behind and moving from desk to desk as 
           the floormen stalk them, STENs up, a deadly shell game. 

           Floorman 1 BRACES his Florsheim on the edge of the desk, 
           straightens his knee, and SHOVES, sending the heavy steel 
           desk across the waxed floor, rolling on squeaky casters. 

           He makes his way down the aisle, KICKING the DESKS as he 
           goes, each desk ROLLING on casters across the slick 
           floor. The other floormen start SHOVING desks. The big 
           tanker desks BASH against each other, SPINNING, 
           RICOCHETING around the floor like BUMPER CARS. 

           Staying low, O’Mara LUNGES out of the way of a desk 
           coming at him like a runaway freight car. He VAULTS 
           another oncoming desk, SHOULDER-ROLLS over the top of 
           another coming right behind it, pops up with his SHOTGUN 
           and BOOM! BOOM! O’Mara pumps double-ought buck into a 
           floorman’s chest, blasting the guy off his feet, causing 
           him to flip backward over the desk behind him-

           -As Wooters JUMPS off a desk, DROPPING to his knees to 
           get under gunfire, SLIDING across the wax-slick floor on 
           his knees. He YANKS the STEN from the floorman’s just-
           dead fingers as he SLIDES past the body on his knees, 
           FIRING the STEN full-auto. Brackabracka! Stitching 
           bullets through a floorman as he slides past him into a 
           desk, sliding into home, KICKING with both legs, SHOVING 
           the desk into a floorman like a battering ram, sending 
           BOTH the desk and the floorman CRASHING out the window! 
           EXT. GUARANTEE FINANCE - CONTINUOUS

           CRASH! Ramirez watches the TANKER DESK and a flailing 
           FLOORMAN sail out through the third floor window, 
           trailing broken blinds like stiff streamers. The desk 
           LANDS - CRUNCH - caving in the hood of a parked 
           Studebaker. People running, screaming. Black SMOKE 
           boiling out of the windows of the GF building.

           Fuck it. That’s it. Ramirez can’t take it anymore. He 
           puts the FORD in GEAR and FLOORS it! 

           Keeler CUTS another wire and uses it to rappel down the 
           side of the building.

           INT. SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Pursuing gunmen fire after them as Kennard and Washington 
           take cover on opposite sides of the stairwell. Powdered 
           plaster GEYSERS off the wall as Kennard calmly reloads. 

                                 WASHINGTON

                        out of their hands, Hoppalong?

           Kennard holsters his revolver and steps out, facing their 
           gunfire. He DRAWS, fanning the hammer. Lighting. BLAM! 
           BLAM! BLAM! Mausers LEAPING from their stinging hands! 

           Another gunman appears BEHIND KENNARD! Washington flicks 
           his switchblade. Throwing the knife into the man’s chest.

                                 KENNARD
                        Much obliged.

           O’Mara SLIPS his foot under a desk, and soccer-jerks his 
           knee up to FLIP the desk UPRIGHT. Using the steel desk as 
           a shield, FIRING his PISTOL from behind it. BAM! BAM! 
           BAM! BAM! Dropping a floorman. His pistol clicks empty. 
           The last floorman fires back. Brackabracka! O’Mara SPINS 
           away from the desk as the bullets collander through it. 
           He DIVES behind two desks, next to Wooters. 

                                 O’MARA

                        Same.

           SMOKE. Burning dollars float like cherry blossoms. The 
           last floorman stalks them through flakes of burning cash, 
           slamming a fresh magazine into his STEN, FIRING as he 
           closes in on their hiding place, barricaded behind desks. 

           We hear HUMMING. The huge FREIGHT ELEVATOR coming. The 
           Floorman looks back, squinting through the smoke, trying 
           to see who’s behind the elevator’s wooden gate. 

           HEADLIGHTS shine out through the slats. An engine REVS. 
           And the FORD SHERIDAN SMASHES out through the elevator 
           gate! The floorman tumbles under the oncoming car. Dead.

           O’Mara and Wooters watch the Ford skid across the fiery 
           Counting Room, scattering desks. Ramirez at the wheel! 

                                 WOOTERS
                        He didn’t get out of the car.

           Ramirez kicks open the door.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Get in.

           O’Mara and Wooters clamber over desks and climb in. 
           Ramirez hits the gas. And the FORD SMASHES THROUGH A WALL 
           and barrels down the wide marble stairs...

           COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES and FIRE TRUCKS arriving, LA 
           COUNTY FIREMEN swing off the running boards, scrambling. 

           I/E. THE OTHER FORD SHERIDAN - NIGHT

           Washington and Kennard rush to the other Ford. Keeler 
           climbs into the car with them, sooty and out of breath. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Where’s O’Mara and Wooters?

                                 KEELER
                                 (coughing)
                        Still inside.

           CONTINUED:

                                 KENNARD
                        And just where in the goddamned 
                        hell is Ramirez?

           Ramirez’s Ford SMASHES out through the front of the 
           building, grill obliterating the revolving doors. 
           DEPUTIES DIVING out of the way as the car fishtails into 
           the street, flames on the hood. For just that moment, the 
           two Fords are not ten feet apart. Kennard, Washington, 
           and Keeler, Ramirez, O’Mara, Wooters, all together.

                                 DEPUTY
                        Who the hell are those guys?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        We’re the Gangster Squad.

           With that, the Fords SMASH through the SAWHORSES, ROARING 
           away up the street before the deputies can react. 

           EXT. GUARANTEE FINANCE BUILDING - LATER

           Burning ASH falls like snow. As FIREMEN scramble to axe 
           open the ground floor windows, the third floor windows 
           suddenly BLOW OUT. The LAFD CHIEF ENGINEER turns to...

                                 CHIEF ENGINEER
                        It’s comin’ down, Sheriff.

           ...The duly-elected Los Angeles County High Sheriff 
           EUGENE W. BISCAILUZ (*who we recognize from Cohen’s table 
           at Slapsy Maxie’s). Biscailuz can only watch this 
           apocalypse. He’s helpless to stop it now.

                                 SHERIFF BISCAILUZ
                        Mother of God.

           There’s a commotion at the sawhorses. LENNOX and JOHNNY 
           STOMP shove gawkers aside to make way for MICKEY COHEN. 
           The Sheriff’s Deputies immediately move the barricades 
           aside to let Cohen pass. And as Cohen stalks through 
           falling ash, we see the fiery carnage in Cohen’s eyes. 
           Cohen coming at him, Sheriff Biscailuz shifts his feet.

                                 COHEN
                        Now, what the hell is a Gangster 
                        Squad, Eugene?

                                 SHERIFF BISCAILUZ
                        We don’t know. Mr. Cohen. Right 
                        now, I’m coordinating the-

                                 COHEN
                        He’s coordinating. That’s my 
                        Golden Goose, Eugene. Least you 
                        could do is get a bucket. 

           Cohen, the old pugilist, KNOCKS Biscailuz on his ass with 
           a swift RIGHT! 20 Uniformed Deputies see it, but no one 
           lifts a finger to intervene. Biscailuz lifts his fingers 
           to touch his bloody mouth. Cohen KICKS HIM IN THE FACE.

                                 COHEN
                        Coordinate this, you putz!

           Deputies turn their heads, looking away, as Cohen stomps 
           the shit out of the High Sheriff of Los Angeles County.

           INT. FORMOSA CAFE - NIGHT

           The raucous Gangster Squad is gathered down at the end of 
           the bar, smoking, laughing, drinking together to 
           celebrate their victory. Ramirez the hero of the hour, 
           slams a shot, coughs. Washington claps him on the back. 

           O’Mara finds Kennard with Keeler, sipping his beer, 
           always with his back to the wall. PATRONS periodically 
           getting up to head back into the crowded BETTING ROOM. 

                                 KENNARD
                        Our young Senor Ramirez’s 
                        drunker’n a peach orchard sow.

                                 O’MARA
                        He did alright today.

                                 KENNARD
                        Yes he did. You know, his dad had 
                        a pushcart in Boyle Heights. 
                        Wouldn’t pay protection to the 
                        Black Hand. They beat him to 
                        death. Ramirez saw it happen. 

           The men watching Ramirez and the squad jostle and laugh. 

                                 O’MARA
                        What the hell did you do before 
                        you came on the job, Max?

                                 KENNARD
                        A lot I ain’t proud of, can’t be 
                        put right again. When Gabriel

                        gonna settle my account with him. 
                        But it does comfort me some. And I 
                        guess I missed wearin’ it today. 

                                 KEELER
                        He’s right. We crossed a line 
                        today. I signed up for this so I 
                        could tell my boy, so I could tell 
                        him, damn it at least I tried to 
                        do something about it. But I hope 
                        he never finds out about this.

                                 O’MARA
                        Well, what do you suggest we do 
                        with an illegal wire tap and no 
                        witnesses willing to talk? Cohen 
                        owns every judge from here to 
                        Fresno. We’re in occupied 
                        territory. There’s no justice in 
                        this town. There’s just us. We’re 
                        the goddamned line. And we’re not 
                        going to win this in a courtroom.  

           Keeler doesn’t have an answer. Wooters walks over.

                                 WOOTERS
                        O’Mara. You gotta see this.

           INT. FORMOSA BETTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wooters leads O’Mara back into the betting room. MEN 
           shouting. Placing Bets. Playing CRAPS in the corner. 
           Wooters points to the TOTALISATOR BOARD, among the 
           RACEHORSES and BOXERS is a section marked GANGSTER SQUAD. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Twenty to one we don’t make it

           O’Mara steels himself, turning to the BOOKMAKER. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Hey, gimme twenty bucks on the 
                        GANGSTER SQUAD.

           A few heads turn. The gamblers thinking he’s nuts.

                                 BOOKMAKER
                        That’s a sucker bet, pal.

                        Yeah, but I got a good feeling.

           Wooters pulls O’Mara aside. The two men nose to nose.

                                 WOOTERS
                        What do you think this is?

                                 O’MARA
                        It means we’re getting to him.

                                 WOOTERS
                        We were lucky today. Don’t you get 
                        it? He’s hunting us now. And we 
                        know he’s got people inside the 
                        department. So how long do you 
                        think our luck’ll hold?
                                 (off O’Mara)
                        I ever tell you my old man was a 
                        gambler? 

                                 O’MARA
                        No. How’d that work out for him?

                                 WOOTERS
                        No idea. Guy went out for a pack 
                        of smokes, never came back. Lived 
                        to the ripe old age of who gives a 
                        shit. But he always said the trick 
                        is knowing when to pick up your 
                        chips and call it a night.
                                 (beat)
                        You see what I’m saying. Today was 
                        as good as it’s ever gonna get for 
                        us. We hurt Cohen. And we can walk 
                        away right now with our heads up.

                                 O’MARA
                        You wanna walk, I can’t stop you. 
                        But I’m not going anywhere, Jerry. 
                        Hear me? This is my city. Not his. 

           INT. O’MARA’S HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT

           O’Mara sits on his couch. Connie is curled up next to 
           him, her fingers in his hair. They’re listening to 
           DRAGNET on the radio, but O’Mara’s miles away.

                                 CONNIE
                                 (feeling a kick)
                        Oh. Here, give me your hand.

           She places O’Mara’s hand on her tummy, trying to bring 
           him back.

                        She’s strong.

           He smiles. But it fades quickly, breaking her heart.

                                 CONNIE
                        You weren’t the same after the 
                        war. It scared me. It was almost 
                        like you’d taken a lover. I kept 
                        waiting for you to come back. But 
                        you never did. You left me, John.

                                 O’MARA
                        I didn’t change. This city did. 
                        While I was fightin’ monsters over 
                        there, they were layin’ down for 
                        one here. Don’t make him angry. 
                        Don’t get in his way. Well, I’ve 
                        seen what’s at the end of that 
                        road. And you wouldn’t like it.

                                 CONNIE
                        You’ve been waiting for this, 
                        haven’t you? I know part of you 
                        has. This whole time you’ve just 
                        been waiting for the chance to 
                        take it up again. When will it be 
                        over, John? You need to tell me. 
                                 (off O’Mara)
                        Then I’m sorry. I can’t wait for 
                        you anymore. 

           And he watches her walk out of the room.

           EXT. COHEN’S MANSION - NIGHT

           A CHAIR smashes out through a window, landing on the 
           lawn. German Shepherds strain their leashes, bark.

           INT. COHEN’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Cohen, roaring and gibbering curses, his homicidal rage 
           like lycanthropy. He’s lost it. Jean cowers in the 
           kitchen, watching Cohen tear his beloved home apart.

                        half a million bucks, easy. 

           His henchmen hang back, trying to avoid his gaze, afraid 
           to leave and afraid to stay as Cohen SMASHES GLASSES, 
           PLATES, FURNITURE. He grabs a FIREPLACE POKER, swinging.

           Tearing PAINTINGS off the wall and PUNCHING HOLES in 
           them. In the kitchen, Jean cringes at the savage sounds. 

           Only Lennox, Cohen’s executioner, is immune to suspicion. 
           He moves stolidly through the mansion with a BUG SWEEPER, 
           passing the device over the walls, furniture, phones.

           Letty, the housekeeper, now ducks into the kitchen to 
           where Jean is hiding, and grabs Jean by her arm. 

                                 LETTY
                        Come on. We need to get you out of 
                        here, Miss Jean. ‘Fore he runs out 
                        of pretty things to break. 

           I/E. COHEN’S MANSION - MINUTES LATER

           German shepherds BARK as Letty helps Jean into the LIMO. 

                                 LETTY
                        Now, you don’t need to come back 
                        here. Not ever. He likes nice 
                        things. But he’s not a nice man. 

           Cohen stalks around the house looking for her, charging 
           into his bedroom to find Lennox, finger to his lips.  
           Lennox squats in front of Cohen’s TELEVISION, passing the 
           device over it. Needles JUMP. Lennox smiles at Cohen. 

           INT. WOOTERS’ APARTMENT - NIGHT

           POUNDING on Wooters’ door. He opens the door. It’s Jean.

                        He’s gone crazy, Jerry. He’s gonna 
                        kill me. 
                                 (tears)
                        You need to get me out of here. 
                        Please.

           INT. WOOTERS’ CAR (MOVING) - MINUTES LATER

           Wooters drives through town, taking a serpentine route 
           one eye on the mirror. Jean sits next to him, in shock. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        You’re gonna be okay. Jean-
                                 (off Jean)
                        Look at me. You’ll be fine.

           Jerry takes another fast turn. She takes a deep breath.

                                 JEAN
                        My name isn’t Jean. It’s Jenny 
                        Mclane. He had me change it. For 
                        professional reasons. 
                                 (beat)
                        I came out here to be a star. 
                                 (bitter tears)
                        This face, I figured I couldn’t 
                        lose. I thought I was going in for 
                        a screen test. They locked me up. 
                        When they found out I was a virgin 
                        they gave me to Judge Krauss. 
                                 (off Wooters)
                        Krauss got me in trouble. So 
                        Cohen’s guys took me to Mexico to 
                        take care of it, but it messed me 
                        up, Jerry, so I, I can’t... 

           He takes one hand off the wheel to hold hers.

           INT. JACK WHALEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The RADIO plays Roy Brown’s BUTCHER PETE, Whalen’s in his 
           kitchen with a bottle of beer, frying up some eggs for 
           dinner. There’s a KNOCK at his door. Whalen pulls a 
           pistol out of his bread box, holding it behind his leg. 

                                 WHALEN
                        We don’t want any!

                                 WOOTERS
                        Jack, it’s Jerry.

           CONTINUED:

           Whalen opens the door to find Wooters and Jean standing 
           outside. He can see by their faces they’re in trouble.

                                 WHALEN
                        Come in. Come in, kids. I was just 
                        fixin’ some eggs.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Jack, I need a favor. You know I 
                        wouldn’t ask, but I need someone 
                        to get her out of town. Tonight.

                                 WHALEN
                        You relax now, cousin. Hear me? 
                        Jack Whalen’s on the case. I’ll 
                        get her out of here safe. 

           Whalen and Wooters shake hands, buddies for life in spite 
           of it all. Wooters and Jean embrace, their last kiss.

           INT. CAFE CALIENTE - NIGHT

           The gangster squad, minus Wooters, is gathered around 
           their table. O’Mara briefing them on their next raid.   

                                 O’MARA
                        Keeler just picked up something on 
                        the wire. Something big. 
                                 (off Wooters’ dismay)
                        Cohen’s gambling ship, THE S.S. 
                        REX. It’s his floating casino. 
                        Operates outside the three-mile 
                        limit, where we can’t touch it. 

                                 KEELER
                        But tomorrow night, around 
                        midnight, she’s docking in San 
                        Pedro for supplies. 

                                 O’MARA
                        And we’re going to be there when 
                        she does.

                                 KENNARD
                        How many guns on board?

                                 O’MARA
                        I figure there can’t be that many.

                                 WASHINGTON
                        You figure.

           CONTINUED:

           The squad exchanges heavy looks.

                                 O’MARA
                        The ocean’s been their defense. 
                        They’re not expecting to be 
                        raided. Listen, Keeler’s going to 
                        be monitoring the wire the whole 
                        time. He hears anything funny, 
                        he’ll get on the radio to warn us.
                                 (off their unease)
                        This is the last one. We take the 
                        Rex and it’s finished. Cohen’s 
                        through. He’ll have to pack it in.

           EXT. SAN PEDRO SHIPYARDS - NIGHT

           Fog. Buoys clang somewhere in the dark. Sea Lions bellow. 
           A Lighthouse BEAM sweeps over Los Angeles Harbor like 
           Sauron’s eye as huge, mechanized CRANES off-load wooden 
           CARGO CONTAINERS from the decks of massive FREIGHTERS.   

           A foreboding labyrinth of wooden CONTAINERS, stacked two 
           and three stories high, covers a half-mile of the 
           concrete docks, like the warehouse at the end of Raiders. 

           Two FORD SHERIDANS parked on the dock. A stakeout.

           I/E. FORD SHERIDANS - NIGHT

           O’Mara and Wooters in one. Washington, Ramirez, Kennard 
           in the other. Ghostly fog around them. Waiting, tense. 
           The cranes off-loading cargo around them. LONGSHOREMEN 
           shouting, waving the crates over, and guiding them in.

                                 WOOTERS
                        John, if that ship comes in loaded 
                        for bear, we’re done, you know it?

                                 O’MARA
                        We’ll be alright.

           The CONTAINERS are stacking up all around them, piling 
           higher, filling gaps, cutting off potential routes of 
           escape, but it’s all happening so slowly, so organically, 
           that no one in the squad realizes they’re deliberately 
           boxing them in. Forming a real ‘box canyon.’ A kill site. 

           Kennard holds a long-loop Winchester 92 across his lap.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           They don’t notice shadowy FIGURES stalking ninja-like 
           among the containers all around them, efficient killers 
           leaping soundlessly from container to container.

           The figures moving to flank the two cars now, crawling 
           across the tops of the containers like Apaches closing in 
           on covered wagons. They carefully unsling Bergman MP-18 
           Submachine guns, quietly unfold the bipods on FG-42 
           automatic rifles, and hunker down, sighting in. Patient.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Time is it?

                                 O’MARA
                        After one.

           Abruptly, all the cranes shut down and the Longshoremen 
           quickly disappear, not wanting to be anywhere near this.

                                 WOOTERS
                        We’ve been had, amigo.

           O’Mara looks around, seeing the trap for the first time.

                                 O’MARA
                        Christ, it’s an ambush-

           EXT. SAN PEDRO SHIPYARDS - NIGHT

           The gunmen on the containers OPEN FIRE. 7.92 mm rounds 
           pocking the concrete and slamming into their vehicles.

           Ramirez throws it in REVERSE and FLOORS it, the car 
           roaring backward, smashing back through a wooden CARGO 
           CRATE and BLASTING out the other side of it, into the 
           labyrinth. And the wall of containers COLLAPSES over the 
           shattered (load-bearing) one, toppling like child’s 
           blocks. Gunmen fall among the tumbling, shattering boxes, 
           firing wildly, some of them crushed under heavy crates.

           ‘RED’ GRANT, Cohen’s firebug, kicks open one of the 
           crates, stepping out with a Flammenwefer 41 FLAMETHROWER. 
           He fires a 100-foot jet of flame. Chemical fire mauls 
           O’Mara’s car, covering every inch of it, the windows, the 
           hood, stealing oxygen from O’Mara and Wooters trapped 
           inside. Grant laughs, watching the Sheridan burn. 

           INSIDE THE CAR:

           O’Mara FLOORS it, gunman firing after them as he steers 
           the flaming car toward the end of the dock. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The car LEAPS off, plunges into the dark water, dousing 
           the flames, sinking 20 feet to the silty bottom. 

           ON THE BOTTOM:

           Water sprays in through broken windows, flooding the 
           passenger compartment. O’Mara and Wooters breathing from 
           a shrinking pocket of air in the passenger compartment.

           IN THE CRATE MAZE:

           Gunmen pursue Washington, Ramirez, and Kennard. GUNFIRE 
           chewing the crates around them to splinters. Ramirez is 
           hit. A round tearing through his bicep. Kennard turns, 
           FIRES his Winchester FAST, taking out three gunmen. They 
           fall off the crates, Washington picks up their MP-18s, 
           one in each hand, FIRING to cover their escape. 

           EXT. SAN PEDRO HARBOR - NIGHT

           Grant runs to the end of the dock and sprays a jet of 
           flame across the water, napalm-flame that stays on the 
           surface, turning all the water around the dock into a 
           lake of hellfire. And to Grant, it’s all so beautiful.  

           O’Mara KICKS out the windshield and he and Wooters swim 
           out, but they can’t come up for air, because the surface 
           is literally on fire: globular continents of flame, like 
           replicating cells. They swim, silhouetted by the fire. 

           Gunmen run to the end of the dock next to the spellbound 
           Grant, stand next to him, and fire their MP-18s down into 
           the water, raking them back and forth across it, bullets 
           cutting through the flaming surface...

           Bullets fizzing down through the water around O’Mara and 
           Wooters as they kick out beyond, surfacing inside a large 
           BOATHOUSE, containing a GRUMANN amphibious plane.   

           ATOP THE CRATES:

           The gunmen run across the tops of the crates, rushing to 
           catch up with their prey. Crouching among the boxes, 
           Washington pops up behind one of them, palm over his 
           mouth, knife in his back, tossing him off the crates. 
           Kennard and Ramirez pop up, blasting two others. Kennard 
           draws his COLT, FIRING it as he tosses Washington his 
           Winchester, Washington FIRING it the moment it’s in his 
           hands. BLAZING GUNFIRE. And when the smoke clears, 
           Washington, Kennard and Ramirez are still standing.   
           INT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

           O’Mara and Wooters pull themselves out of the water, 
           gasping, flopping into a SKIFF. Wooters grabs the 
           emergency kit, pops it open, searching... 

           Grant and one of the gunmen enter the boathouse, running 
           along the wooden catwalk. O’Mara and Wooters spider-cling 
           to the bottom of the catwalk, water dripping. 

           After they pass them, O’Mara climbs the ladder, holding 
           the skiff’s outboard motor. He pulls the starter cord: 
           rummmm! Swings the outboard like a chainsaw, samurai-
           slashing down across the gunman’s back. The gunman drops 
           his MP-18 and pitches forward into the drink. 

           But even before the gunman hits the water, O’Mara’s 
           charging Grant. Grant brings the nozzle of the 
           flamethrower around at O’Mara as O’Mara swings the 
           roaring outboard, the prop slashing both Grant’s arm and 
           his fuel hose. Grant clutches his arm. The hose whips 
           around, spraying fuel over the catwalk.

           O’Mara raises the outboard over his head, but Wooters 
           grabs him and pulls him back along the catwalk as Grant 
           staggers, fumbles after the hose. Wooters raises an 
           emergency FLARE PISTOL and FIRES at Grant. WHOOMPF! They 
           run from the flaming boathouse.

           EXT. SAN PEDRO SHIPYARDS - MINUTES LATER

           The shipyards are a war zone. FIRE BOAT shoots water into 
           the flaming boathouse. O’Mara, Wooters, Kennard, 
           Washington, Ramirez, lean against crates. They’re alive, 
           but shaken. SIRENS approach. LAPD PROWLERS pull up to 
           surround the squad. They drop their guns, hands up. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        It was a set-up.

           A SHADOW at the tarp behind Keeler. 

                                 COHEN
                        Just business, Keeler.

                                                              HARD CUT TO:

           POV: For this claustrophobic second, we SEE only DARKNESS 
           through the cotton. We HEAR CRICKETS, and Keeler’s 
           BREATHING sifted through the pillowcase. 

                                 LENNOX (O.S.)
                        Hear that? Middle of the god 
                        damned city and you can still hear 
                        the crickets. 

           EXT. UNKNOWN - NIGHT

           The LA sky full of stars we’d never be able to see above 
           Los Angeles today. The downtown skyline in the distance, 
           but we still don’t know exactly where we are. We can just 
           make out four FIGURES near the edge of a WOODEN PLATFORM. 
           Lennox is there, hands in the pockets of his overcoat, 
           while thugs flank Keeler, wrists HANDCUFFED behind his 
           back. Pillowcase over his head. The cotton pillowcase 
           SUCKS against his mouth with each panicked breath.

                                 LENNOX
                        I love that sound. It’s, I don’t 
                        know, it’s peaceful, isn’t it?

           Lennox NODS and the thugs REMOVE the pillowcase to REVEAL 
           a terrified KEELER, his nose broken, eye swollen. Lennox 
           now IGNITES a Magnesium FLARE, a GREEN GLOW as Lennox 
           HOLDS the flare up to Keeler’s face. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The bright FLAME fizzes between them, acrid chemical 
           smoke spooling from it. Keeler clinches his eyes shut, 
           twists his sweat-slick face away from the hot flare. But 
           the thugs HOLD him.

                                 LENNOX
                        Now, I won’t lie to you. A 
                        bullet’s the best deal in town 
                        tonight. It’s quick. Easy. 

           Lennox smiles, pulling the flare AWAY from Keeler’s face. 
           Keeler blinks, chest heaving.

                                 LENNOX
                        At this point, a bullet’s, well, 
                        it’s my personal gift. Because 
                        hell I admire a man with sand. And 
                        you got more than your share.

           Lennox now DROPS the flare off the pier and we FOLLOW it 
           down, splashing into DARK WATER, the hearty magnesium 
           staying lit. The flare hisses and burbles as it sinks to 
           the bottom of a LARGE POND, and the pulsing flare 
           instantly causes the water around the pier to GLOW with 
           its gelatinous GREEN LIGHT. And for the first time we 
           know where we are, the alligator farm, because the huge 
           ALLIGATORS are now visible in sharp relief, lit from 
           below, snaking through the glowing water, waiting...

                                 LENNOX
                        And all you have to do to get it 
                        is tell me where the money is.

                                 KEELER
                        The money?

           Keeler laughs. It’s infectious. Lennox chuckles a little.

                                 LENNOX
                        The hell’s so damn funny?

           Keeler’s handcuffs fall to the deck. Clank. 

                                 KEELER
                        I always keep a spare key.

           He reaches into the coat of the thug to his left, pulling 
           out the guy’s gun and BAM! BAM! BLOWING HIM BACKWARD, 
           splintering through the rail, off the PIER! The thug 
           SLASHES into the water, screaming as the WATER COMES 
           ALIVE, BOILING with JAWS and MOTTLED GREEN SKIN as Keeler 
           SPINS to fire at Lennox, BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Lennox GRABS 
           the other thug, using him as a human shield. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Click. Keeler’s gun empty. Lennox TOSSES the body aside 
           and PULLS his 1918 TRENCH KNIFE with the brass-knuckle 
           “D” Guard handle as Keeler RUSHES him. Lennox coming up 
           with the knife, driving it up into Keeler, killing him.

           EXT. GARDEN OF ALLAH - NIGHT

           Whalen pulls into the Garden of Allah: Hotel and Villas. 
           It’s late. The guests are asleep. Shadows. Crickets.

                                 JEAN
                        I don’t just want out of town, 
                        Jack. I want out of the life. And 
                        that money’s my grubstake. It’s 
                        all I have to get started with. 

           Whalen can relate. He’d himself leave if he could. Whalen 
           stows her in a fragrant slice of shadow, out of sight.

                                 WHALEN
                        Wait here.

           Whalen hurries past the main building, Hollywood’s 
           largest SWIMMING POOL, heading down a path of paver tiles 
           into a Hobbit-village of little Bungalows.

           EXT. BUNGALOW 12 - SECONDS LATER

           Whalen kneels by the planter, digs out a coffee can. 
           Whalen waits, watching the path of pavers between villas.

           Whalen walks back down the dark path of pavers between 
           the bungalows. Then Whalen SEES them, COHEN, HOOKY 
           ROTHMAN, and JOHNNY STOMP coming around the main 
           building! They haven’t seen Jean yet, but they see him. 

           Jean holds her breath, watching Cohen and his men walk 
           past her hiding place. They can’t see her in the dark. 
           They’re walking past the pool now, heading for Whalen.

           She can hear Whalen whistling as he walks down the path 
           to face Cohen and his boys, like Gary Cooper walking out 
           to meet Frank Miller and his gang. She doesn’t dare move. 

           EXT. GARDEN OF ALLAH (POOL AREA) - NIGHT

           Cohen, Rothman and Johnny Stomp watch Whalen come 
           whistling out of the shadows, not a care in the world. 
           Underwater pool lights put blue ripples over their faces.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 COHEN
                        Where is she, Jack?

                                 WHALEN
                        You brought your trouble boys with 
                        you just to see Jean? 

           Whalen takes off his jacket, lays it neatly across a 
           chaise lounge. Rothman and Johnny Stomp step closer.

                                 WHALEN (CONT’D)
                        Were you expecting some kinda 
                        trouble, Mickey?

           Whalen unbuttons his cuffs, rolling up his sleeves now.

                                 WHALEN (CONT’D)
                        Or maybe you’re lookin’ for some.

                                 COHEN
                        My dog shits more trouble than 
                        you’re gonna give me, Jack.

                                 WHALEN
                        Well, come an’ get you a piece.

           Rothman and Stomp launch at Whalen and Whalen plays 
           Mickey’s trouble boys a little improvised chin music, 
           heavy on the snare drum. Whalen’s never fought better in 
           his life. And part of him knows he never will again. Hoka-
           Hey, sons of bitches. Today is a good day to die. Wrevock 
           and Johnny Stomp go down hard, but Whalen’s not finished. 
           He steps over them, coming at Cohen now.

                                 WHALEN
                        You’re up next, you little creep. 
                        I got somethin’ here I been savin’ 
                        up special for you, Mickey. 

           Whalen stalks Cohen around the pool, Hulk hands opening 
           and closing. Jean watches, helpless, Cohen pulls a 
           PISTOL. Whalen just smiles, knowing he’s won.

                                 JOHNNY STOMP
                        No, Mickey. DON’T!

           But Cohen ignores him. He’s too far gone now. And Jean 
           watches as Cohen SHOOTS Whalen in the chest. BOOM! Whalen 
           falls backward, arms out-flung, crashing down through the 
           still surface of the lighted pool, sinking. The pool 
           light changing, now bathing Cohen’s FACE in DEEP RED. 
           INT. O’MARA’S HOME - NIGHT

           Connie asleep. Moonlight coming through the shades. The 
           baby KICKS, waking her. A SHADOW passes across the 
           window. Instinct. She swings her feet off the bed and 
           gets down on all-fours just as... Brackabrackabrackabra! 
           BULLETS PUNCH THROUGH WINDOWS AND WALLS around her.

           Connie crawls down the hallway, hauls herslf into the 
           bathroom as the Brackabrackabrackabracka! Glass and 
           splinters raining down. Brackabrackabrackabracka! The 
           mirror and tiles shatter around her. Connie SCREAMS.

           I/E. O’MARA’S HOME - MINUTES LATER

           O’Mara pulls up to his home in a PROWL CAR, the street 
           choked with LAPD PROWL CARS and an AMBULANCE. Their 
           little house is shot to pieces. UNIFORMS on the front 
           lawn with shotguns. O’Mara RUNS past them, SHOVING the 
           uniforms aside, up the porch. He runs through the living 
           room, where more uniforms are milling somberly, down the 
           hallway, past the bloody paramedics, into the bathroom...

           INT. O’MARA’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           O’Mara approaches the bathtub. He sees her blood on the 
           rim. And everything, every atom, changes for him. O’Mara 
           kneeling next to the bathtub, his wife curled inside, 
           unharmed. Their newborn baby girl suckling at her breast.

           EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE (HOLLYWOOD HILLS) - DAWN

           Wooters pulling up to the front of the abandoned HOUSE, 
           Keeler’s FIELD OFFICE, jogs up the slope to the half-
           finished home. Mounting dread. 

           INT. ABANDONED HOUSE

           Wooters pull aside the tarp to find Keeler’s chair 
           TOPPLED. LISTENING EQUIPMENT SMASHED. TAPES GONE. 
           Movement. Wooters SPINS, gun up. A page of stained 
           NEWSPAPER is wrapped around something on Keeler’s 
           makeshift desk. The paper bulges and crinkles. Something 
           moving inside it. Wooters unwraps it. The thing wrapped 
           inside the paper BITES his finger. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Arrgh. Damn it.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The BABY ALLIGATOR scrambles off the desk into a corner, 
           leaving the front page of the Los Angeles Times open in 
           the desk, the headline: WHO ARE THE GANGSTER SQUAD? 

           I/E. COHEN’S MANSION - MORNING

           O’Mara FLOORS it, taking the PROWLER straight up Cohen’s 
           driveway at ramming speed, SMASHING through Cohen’s gate, 
           the car skidding laterally across Cohen’s lawn. And 
           O’Mara’s stepping out, FIRING at Cohen’s GUNMEN as they 
           come charging out the front door. BAM! BAM! BAM! Killing 
           three gunmen as soon as they clear the doorway. Cohen’s 
           gunmen shudder and collapse bloody on the front steps. 
           One death-firing his M-3 as he falls, brakabrackabracka! 
           Shattering terra-cotta pots, spilling soil and roses. No 
           one even makes it to the front lawn.

           O’Mara charges into the house, FIRING at another GUNMAN 
           who dives into the DINING ROOM.

                                 GUNMAN
                                 (calling out)
                        Hey! HEY! Uncle! I give, okay? 

           He tosses his GUN out on to the carpet and steps out, 
           hands up, shaking. O’Mara’s pistol tracks his every step.

                                 GUNMAN
                        Don’t shoot. Jesus. Olly olly oxen 
                        free, okay?

                                 O’MARA
                                 (re: the tossed gun)
                        Pick it up. Please.

           O’Mara can’t kill an unarmed man. Wants to. Can’t.

                                 O’MARA
                        Then give your boss a message for 
                        me, willya?

           O’Mara lowers his gun ten degrees and FIRES, shooting the 
           man through the leg. Arrgh! He collapses in pain. O’Mara 
           stands over him, gun pointed at his other leg.

                                 O’MARA
                        You sure you got all that? Or do 
                        you need me to repeat it? 

                                 WOOTERS (O.S.)
                        JOHN!

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           O’Mara looks up at Wooters, and down at the man clutching 
           his leg, cowering beneath him. O’Mara sees his own hands 
           around his gun. He’s lost. And they both know it.

           INT. LAPD PROWLER (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

           O’Mara and Wooters in their prowler, O’Mara driving them 
           out of the Hollywood Hills. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        You kill Cohen there’s no end to 
                        it. Widow your wife. Orphan your 
                        baby. And the Syndicate sends 
                        somebody else here to replace him.

                                 O’MARA
                        Maybe.

                                 WOOTERS
                        There’s no maybe about it. This is 
                        where I get off, John. I’m done. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD GREYHOUND STATION - DAY

           A line of TRAVELERS carrying suitcases file into a 
           GREYHOUND BUS bound for PORTLAND. Jean takes her place in 
           line, no luggage, ticket in hand. She’s leaving Los 
           Angeles the same way she arrived, by bus, with nothing. 

           Jean looks over her shoulder at the skyline, torn.

           EXT. UNION STATION - SUNSET

           Washington, Kennard, Ramirez like secret service agents, 
           watching the platform as O’Mara helps the fragile Connie 
           on to the TRAIN. The baby in a bassinet. 

           INT. TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

           O’Mara helps Connie to her seat. Connie lifts the baby 
           from her bassinet, holds her. 

                                 O’MARA
                        You both deserve better than what 
                        this city’s become.

           She glances out the window at the squad on the platform.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CONNIE
                        Is that what you want me to tell 
                        her? When she asks me what 
                        happened to her father? 

                                 O’MARA
                        I’ll tell her myself. Listen to 
                        me. I don’t want to die, Connie. I 
                        want to build us a life here.

                        But I have to finish this.

                        Good luck, John. 

           EXT. KEELER’S FRONT PORCH - DUSK

           O’Mara walks out the front door. Behind him MARCIA KEELER 
           sits on her sofa, handkerchief, eyes red. Grief like a 
           physical creature pinning her to the sofa. 

           Keeler’s son CHARLIE sits alone on the porch, chin in his 
           hands. Eyes far away. O’Mara sees Charlie’s bike leaned 
           up against the porch, the one his father fixed for him. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        My dad’s dead, isn’t he?

                                 O’MARA
                        Yes. 

           Before O’Mara can react. Charlie lunges off the porch, 
           grabs his bike, SLAMS it against the tree, STOMPING the 
           spokes out of the wheel his dad fixed for him. O’Mara 
           wraps Charlie in a bear hug, pinning the boy’s arms to 
           his sides. Charlie twists, struggles, tears of rage. 

           O’Mara holds him as Charlie turns, hugging O’Mara tight. 
           The boy’s silent tears staining O’Mara’s shirt.

           INT. CITY HALL (BUNCO FORGERY) - NIGHT

           O’Mara sits at his desk alone. Reports have piled up. 
           Gates approaches, looking like an undertaker. 

                                 GATES
                        We need to talk.
           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

                                 GATES
                        You’ve been disbanded. 

                                 O’MARA
                        What? Why?

           Gates sighs before telling the patient it’s cancer.

                                 GATES
                        The chief has obtained assurances 
                        that Cohen will confine his 
                        operations to the unincorporated 
                        county and surrounding 
                        municipalities. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Assurances? You’re telling me men 
                        died just so he could cut a deal 
                        with Cohen? He used me. All along. 

           O’Mara rages, PUNCHING his locker again and again, caving 
           in the door. His knuckles bloody. Other COPS come running 
           to the commotion, but seeing O’Mara’s face, they move on.

                                 GATES
                        I didn’t know.

                                 O’MARA
                                 (chest heaving)
                        He won, Gates. Cohen beat us. 

           EXT. OLVERA STREET - NIGHT

           A Mariachi BAND plays in the bandstand. COUPLES dancing, 
           whooping, laughing in the plaza. Kids carrying sparklers. 

           INT. CAFE CALIENTE (CROWDED FOR DINNER) - NIGHT

           Inside, what’s left of the GANGSTER SQUAD: O’Mara, 
           Washington, Kennard, and Ramirez sit at a big table in 
           the back of the restaurant. Ramirez arm bandaged. 

                                 KENNARD
                        So that’s it. We’re done.

                                 O’MARA
                        Parker called it off. It’s over. 
                        I’m sorry. This is my fault.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Then O’Mara looks up to see MICKEY COHEN making his way 
           over to their table, along with Lennox. 

           Cohen approaches O’Mara’s table. Hand dropping to his 
           side, Washington flicks his switchblade open, holding it 
           upside down against his wrist, ready to throw it. Tense. 
           Ramirez reaches for his gun, but Kennard stills him. 
           Nobody’s doing anything in the middle of this crowd.

                                 COHEN
                        So this is the Gangster Squad. You 
                        guys are somethin’ else, ya know 
                        it. I don’t know whether to shoot 
                        you or ask for your autographs.

           Cohen grabs a chair and flips it around to straddle it. 

                                 COHEN
                        Listen, I gotta be honest here. I 
                        wanna kill all a’ ya right now. I 
                        mean bad. Bad as I’ve ever wanted 
                        any woman. 
                                 (to O’Mara)
                        And I know you wanna kill me, 
                        dontcha, soldier boy?

           He’s right. We see O’Mara fighting to contain his rage. 

                                 O’MARA
                        I would like that very much. 

                                 COHEN
                        Trouble is you’re already dead. 
                        All of you. You just don’t have 
                        the sense to lay down.
                                 (beat)
                        And let me tell you, I’m the only 
                        one who can bring you back from 
                        the dead. So here’s the deal. Hand 
                        over the money and I’ll let you 
                        leave town with your heads still 
                        attached. Give back what you stole 
                        and get out of my city.

                                 O’MARA
                        The hell are you talkin’ about? 

                                 COHEN
                        The money you took from Guarantee 
                        Finance. I make it half a million.

                        We burned it. We burned it all.
                        We didn’t want your money, Mickey. 
                        We just want you gone. We’re cops.

                        not cops. Way you came at me. You 
                        killed a dozen guys. Burned my 
                        place to the ground. No, I know 
                        gangsters when I see ‘em. You guys

                        came cheap. So I’m the only law

                        How do we find you?

                        Ah, don’t worry. I’ll find you.

           Cohen walks out. Lennox follows.

           EXT. CAFE CALIENTE - MOMENTS LATER

           O’Mara, Kennard, Washington and Ramirez walk out of the 
           restaurant to the plaza, watching Cohen and his men walk 
           across, moving like sharks through DANCERS. Fireworks. 
           Catherine wheels SPIN. Sparks rain down on the plaza. 

           EXT. PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

           On his way past the bandstand, Lennox climbs the stairs 
           and whispers to the MARIACHI BAND LEADER. The man looks 
           frightened, but he nods, and they stop mid-song and begin 
           to play the DE GUELLO, a haunting dirge. Hearing it, the 
           DANCERS stop dancing and hustle out of the plaza, 
           superstitious. Lennox looks back across the plaza and 
           salutes them, following Cohen and Wrevock to their limo.

                                 O’MARA
                        What’s that about?

                        It’s the De Guello. They call it 
                        the throat-slitting song. 

                                 KENNARD
                        Messicans played it before they 
                        took the Alamo. Means there’s no 
                        quarter. Means every one of us’ll 
                        be put to the sword.

           O’Mara looks at his men: Kennard, Washington, Ramirez. 
           Sparks raining on them. My God, what have I done?

           INT. O’MARA’S HOME - NIGHT

           O’Mara sits alone, unshaven, in his ruined, empty home. A 
           bottle in one hand, his gun in the other. His front porch 
           CREAKS. A knock. He raises his .45 halfheartedly at the 
           door. Hell, it might as well end here.

                                 O’MARA
                        Who’s there?

           They drink. It’s bitter.

                        You were right. Parker was using 
                        me. I didn’t change a damn thing. 
                        I’m just going to wake up walking 
                        on the wrong side of the grass.

                        Well, we all are. 

           Long beat while O’Mara fights the urge to unburden 
           himself, and loses...

                        We were supposed to drop into 
                        Castlenau, but we came in too low, 
                        clipped a tree, went down in the 
                        forest south of a village called 
                        Fources. Smith and Malik wounded. 
                        Broken femur. Broken back. So we 
                        rigged a trellis for each of ‘em, 
                        hid out in a farmhouse.

                        It was supposed to be safe. The

                        But they got scared. Sold us out.

                        Smith and Malik couldn’t walk. We

                        couldn’t risk leaving ‘em. See 
                        because, because, you know, the 
                        krauts, they...they would’ve 
                        gotten it out of ‘em. Who’s in the

                        that at least. They looked away so 
                        I wouldn’t have to see their eyes.

           Off O’Mara.

           INT. BULLPEN - LAPD ADMINISTRATIVE VICE - DAY

           Wooters is packing up his desk. The Secretary approaches 
           Wooters, cheerful and oblivious.

                        You have a visitor, Jerry.

           Wooters looks across the bullpen to see JEAN walking 
           hesitantly toward him. She’s uncomfortable in the police 
           station. Wooters runs to her, holds her. She’s alive.

                        Jack saved my life. He fought like

           INT. JUDGE KRAUSS’S CHAMBERS - DAY

           Judge Krauss sips his coffee, reading the paper. He looks 
           up, startled to see O’Mara and Wooters standing over him.

           O’Mara is restored, transformed, clean-shaven and clear-
           eyed. In fact, both he and Wooters look razor sharp, 
           their ties straight, shoes polished to a high gloss, hat-
           brims just so. LAPD BADGES gleaming on their belts. 

                                 JUDGE KRAUSS
                        Who the hell let you in here?

           O’Mara holds a WARRANT AFFIDAVIT in his hand.

                                 O’MARA
                        We need a favor, Judge. 

                                 JUDGE KRAUSS
                        Get out of my chambers. I don’t do 
                        favors.

                                 WOOTERS
                        You sure about that, Your Honor?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Jean steps into his office, her jaw set, facing him. 
           Seeing her, Krauss pales, his hands shake. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        There. Now that’s more like it, 
                        you son of a bitch. 

                                 O’MARA
                        See, we’ve been up on Cohen’s 
                        phone for a while now. So you’re 
                        gonna step down. 

           O’Mara places the Affidavit on the desk in front of him.

                                 O’MARA
                        But before you do, just this once, 
                        you’re gonna do the right thing.

           Krauss shakily scribbles his signature. O’Mara looms.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Now, where is he?

                                 KRAUSS
                        Somewhere in town. He didn’t trust 
                        me enough to tell me where. 

                                 O’MARA
                        Smart. Day I arrested Racine and 
                        those other assholes? Time I got 
                        to the station, you already had 
                        writs waitin’ for all of ‘em. So 
                        who was it stiffed in the call?

           INT. CITY HALL (DETECTIVE’S BUREAU) - NIGHT

           The bureau is empty. HENDRICKS waits at the ELEVATORS. 
           Ding! Hendricks’ elevator arrives, going down. Doesn’t 
           notice O’MARA and WOOTERS step up behind him. They grab 
           him by the shoulders, holding him there.

                                 WOOTERS
                        You can catch the next one, fatso.

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK (27TH FLOOR) - MOMENTS LATER

           Ding! The elevator doors open and Wooters HAULS Hendricks 
           out on the observation platform of LA CITY HALL, the 
           tallest building in LA, and the one on the LAPD badge.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 HENDRICKS
                        Take your hands off me you son of 
                        a bitch. I know people. Hear me?

           Wooters SLAMS Hendricks against the railing, overlooking 
           the gorgeous Los Angeles SKYLINE. Twinkling neon.

                                 WOOTERS
                        I’m counting on it.

           He has Hendricks by the collar, forcing Hendricks to arch 
           his back against the railing. 27 floors down.

                                 WOOTERS
                        Where’s Cohen?

                                 O’MARA
                        Slow down, Jerry.

                                 HENDRICKS
                        You won’t drop me.

           Wooters forces him further out over the ledge.

                                 WOOTERS
                        You sold us out. Killed Keeler. 
                        Same as if you pulled the trigger.

           Hendricks doesn’t see the WINDOW WASHER’S PLATFORM, 
           neither does O’Mara, but Wooters does. He SHOVES.

           Hendricks flips backward, screaming 10 feet down to land 
           in a heap on the window washer’s platform. Wooters VAULTS 
           the railing to drop down next to him. Pulleys CREAK. 
           Wooters handcuffs Hendricks’ right wrist to the pipe 
           frame of the platform and KICKS him off! Hendricks 
           dangles.

                                 HENDRICKS
                        Ah, CHRIST! JESUS! JESUS!

                                 WOOTERS
                        Where’s Cohen?

                                 HENDRICKS
                        I can’t!

           Wooters RELEASES THE BRAKE. THE PLATFORM DROPS A FLOOR! 
           Hendricks screams. He pulls the brake again. The platform 
           stops abruptly, dislocating Hendricks’ shoulder. Arrgh!  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 HENDRICKS
                        He’s at the Roosevelt! Jesus 
                        Christ! John, help me up!  

                                 WOOTERS
                        Don’t worry. Somebody’ll find you 
                        up here. Eventually.

           Wooters grabs one of the lines, swiftly climbing the rope 
           back up to the observation platform. O’Mara helps him up.

                                 O’MARA
                                 (smiling)
                        You’re Section 8, you know it?

                                 GATES (PRELAP)
                        I know it’s not much. But I wanted 
                        to give you something. Might help.

           INT. LAPD EVIDENCE ROOM (SUB-BASEMENT) - NIGHT

           Gates unlocks the cage and leads Wooters and O’Mara into 
           the dark storeroom, to a TABLE covered by a TARPAULIN. 

                                 GATES
                        Robbery confiscated these months 
                        ago. Case went nowhere, of course. 

           Gates haul back the heavy tarp to reveal THOMPSON 
           “ANNIHILATOR” SUBMACHINE GUNS. O’Mara hefts his old war 
           buddy, the weapon an extension of himself, like a katana. 
           Sandalwood butt, vertical fore-grip, finned Barrel capped 
           with a blued Cutts compensator. Hundred-round drum mag.

                                 GATES (CONT’D)
                        Cohen’s a cockroach, Sergeant.

           Gates opens a trunk and hauls out U.S. ARMY ammunition 
           box marked CAUTION: INCENDIARIES. Wooters opens one of 
           the ammo boxes and plucks out a red-tinged TRACER BULLET.

                                 GATES
                        Swat him like one.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - NIGHT

           Clouds gather over the city. A storm is coming. O’Mara 
           and Wooters stand in front of City Hall, where they 
           watched Racine and his goons get into that limo a 
           thousand years ago. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Kennard appears out of the shadows. Then Washington. Then 
           Ramirez. The Gangster Squad standing together again. 

                                 WASHINGTON
                        What’s the plan, Sarge?

           O’Mara’s moved beyond words.

                                 O’MARA
                        Parker never wanted to stop Cohen. 
                        He just wanted him out of his 
                        hair. But we don’t work for 
                        Parker. We work for the City of 
                        Los Angeles.

           O’Mara pulls his gleaming BADGE, holding it up.

                                 O’MARA
                        Says so right on the badge. We’re 
                        not soldiers. We’re not gangsters.
                                 (off The Squad)
                        We’re police officers.

           O’Mara pulls the WARRANT AFFIDAVIT from his coat.

                                 O’MARA
                        Now, I have here an arrest 
                        warrant, signed by a magistrate, 
                        for Mickey Cohen. For the crime of 
                        murder. And I’m bringin’ him in. 

                                 KENNARD
                        We go out there and try an’ put 
                        handcuffs on that sumbitch, some 
                        of us ain’t comin’ back.

                                 O’MARA
                        I have to do this. 

           The men look around, nodding. They’ve come this far and 
           they’re with O’Mara until the wheels fall off.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL - NIGHT

           We can HEAR the RAIN outside as Lennox steps out of the 
           elevator on the 12th floor. Cohen has rented out the 
           entire floor. Lennox passes several armed MECHANICS 
           (hitmen) in the hallway. 
           INT. COHEN’S SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           It now resembles a bunker. MECHANICS assemble an arsenal 
           of wicked assault weapons on the bed, thumbing rounds 
           into magazines. Cohen stands at the window with a drink, 
           looking out over the KLEIG LIGHTS of Hollywood Boulevard.

                                 LENNOX
                        I just got off the phone with 
                        Krauss. He says he signed the 
                        warrant himself. 

                                 COHEN
                        Yeah? And who’s gonna serve it? 
                        Five guys? Forget it. Five guys 
                        won’t make it past the damn lobby. 
                        Nobody’s arresting me.

           But the ursine Lennox isn’t convinced. He lifts a Carcano 
           carbine off the bed, testing the heft. The exotic, 7.35 
           mm RIFLE fitted with a side-mounted 38.5 mm GRENADE 
           LAUNCHER. We HEAR Vaughn Monroe’s Riders in the Sky as...

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - MIDNIGHT

           The Gangster Squad drives through Hollywood, Kleig lights 
           stabbing the rain-shrouded night sky. Tires HISS through 
           the rain. Each man wearing his war face, knowing one way 
           or another this ends tonight. This is it. No regrets.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

           RAIN pounds the boulevard with extreme prejudice. Streams 
           fill the gutters. The last COUPLES hustle from GRAUMAN’S 
           CHINESE THEATRE (*the feature: GUN CRAZY).

           EXT. ROOF OF THE DRUGSTORE ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT

           NEDDY HERBERT patrols the neon-puddled roof with 
           binoculars and a BAR rifle. From this high vantage, he 
           sees up and down the boulevard. Rain sheeting across it. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

           The Gangster Squad pulls their Fords to the flooded curb. 
           They step out into the driving rain and shoulder SATCHELS 
           carrying extra drum mags. They pull their Thompsons out 
           of the trunk. Wooters offers a Thompson to Kennard.

           Kennard TWIRLS his PEACEMAKER, holsters it.

                                 KENNARD
                        I’m gonna dance with the one what 
                        brung me.

           INT. ROOSEVELT (FIRST FLOOR ROOM) - NIGHT

           HOOKY ROTHMAN watches the Boulevard through parted 
           curtains, a huge LEWIS GUN braced against the windowsill. 
           He looks like he can’t wait to try out his new toy.

           INT. ROOSEVELT LOBBY - NIGHT

           WREVOCK and three other GUNMEN loiter and pace the empty 
           Spanish-revival lobby, smoking, not even bothering to 
           conceal their ASSAULT RIFLES. DING! Wrevock TAPS the BELL 
           on the BELL DESK. Nobody’s coming, the lobby deserted.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

           Water sheets off brims of their fedoras as the Squad 
           checks their weapons. O’Mara and his men walk, not 
           hurrying, down Hollywood Boulevard toward the Roosevelt. 
           What few PEDESTRIANS there are SCURRY out of their way, 
           HUSTLING out of the street before all hell breaks loose.

           EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Now, O’Mara and his men stop in the middle of Hollywood 
           Boulevard right in front of the Roosevelt. O’Mara’s men 
           spread out as he lifts his BULLHORN. 

                                 O’MARA (BULLHORN)

           Cohen looks out the window to see O’Mara and his men 
           standing out in the middle of the boulevard.

           EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The Mechanics walk out of the lobby. More and MORE of 
           them pouring out of the Roosevelt until the Gangster 
           Squad faces a dozen heavily armed men fanned out in front 
           of the Roosevelt. A pregnant moment. 

                                 HEAD MECHANIC
                        Hey, cop. I’ve got a better idea. 
                        Why don’t you guys take a walk?

           Just RAIN and their FOGGING BREATH. The Squad puts their 
           Thompson guns to their shoulders, barrels still angled at 
           the deck. Kennard stands with his feet shoulder-width 
           apart, his fingers splayed and ready.

                                 KENNARD
                        You call it, Sarge.

           O’Mara looks to Wooters, standing at his side. Wooters 
           nods. O’Mara thumbs his FIRE SELECTOR to FULL AUTO. 

           The MECHANICS raise their weapons and...

                                 O’MARA
                        Light ‘em up.

           The Squad raise their Thompsons and FIRE. Bright red BALL 
           TRACERS pierce the stormy Hollywood night, photon 
           torpedoes fizzing full-auto through the rain! We’ve never 
           seen a fire fight like this. Streaming dotted-lines of 
           tracer bullets CLEAVE through the sheets of rain. 850 
           rounds per minute. Each round leaves its own contrail, 
           instantly reducing the rain around it to hissing steam.

           The Mechanics UNLEASH their own high-velocity HELL. 
           Bullets whizzing, KICKING up chunks of asphalt around 
           them. Black Hawk Down on Hollywood Boulevard. Kennard 
           fans the hammer of his Peacemaker, dropping Mechanics.
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS

           O’Mara and Wooters take cover behind a parked CAR at the 
           corner DRUGSTORE, FIRING from cover, TRACERS drilling the 
           gunmen. Brass SHELLS clatter the wet sidewalk. Rain 
           HISSES off the hot barrel of O’Mara’s Thompson. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Pretty dumb, huh?

                                 O’MARA
                        The dumbest.

           Smoke spirals from Wooters’ compensator as he DROPS the 
           EMPTY MAG, slams a FRESH MAG home, FIRING again. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

           HOOKY ROTHMAN fires his LEWIS GUN: a man-killing monster 
           with a cooling-shroud on the barrel and fifty-round top-
           mounted, drum-pan magazine. ROTHMAN pulls the trigger, 
           holds it down, 30-06 rounds ROARING out at Ramirez. BOOM-
           BOOM-BOOM! Ramirez DIVES out of the way as the 30-06 
           rounds RUPTURE a FIRE HYDRANT, spraying a wall of water.

           Kennard stands in the street and FIRES, not at ROTHMAN, 
           but at the LEWIS GUN itself, BOOM, BOOM! Kennard’s rounds 
           sparking against the thick, shrouded barrel of the chunky 
           Lewis. Each bullet impact TURNING the LEWIS. And we see 
           Kennard’s actually forcing the unwitting Rothman to MOW 
           DOWN THREE OF HIS OWN MEN before he realizes it! 

                                 KENNARD
                        Careful with that contraption.

           Kennard fires again, putting one through Rothman’s chest. 

           INT. ROOSEVELT LOBBY - NIGHT

           O’Mara and Wooters CHARGE into the lobby, Thompson guns 
           BLAZING, killing one gunman. Wrevock and two other gunmen 
           fire back. Plaster spitting off the walls. 

           Wooters and O’Mara BREAK off in opposite directions, 
           gunfire chasing them from PILLAR to PILLAR. Couches 
           BURST, stuffing snow-globe into the air. 

           Wrevock FIRES at Wooters. Chandeliers FALL. The terra-
           cotta FOUNTAIN SHATTERS and water floods out across the 
           tiles. And one of Wrevock’s shots PIERCES Wooters’ LEG! 
           Wooters tumbles and scoots against a pillar. Shit.
           EXT. ROOF OF THE DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS

           Neddy Herbert swaps mags to FIRE down at Kennard and 
           Ramirez. But Kennard SHOVES Ramirez out of the way. 
           Bullets TEAR through Kennard. He staggers, and falls.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS

           Washington runs out into the street, GRABS Kennard, and 
           drags him back behind a parked car, FIRING his Thompson. 
           But once he makes it to cover, Washington touches his 
           side, and his hand comes away bloody. Shit. Ramirez and 
           Washington crouch next to Kennard. Two in Kennard’s upper 
           chest. The wound’s mortal and he knows it.

                        RAMIREZ
                                                        KENNARD
           You okay?
                                              Nope.

           Unable to stand, Kennard twists painfully to FIRE his 
           Peacemaker from a seated position. Still in the fight.

                                 KENNARD
                        But at least I’m gonna die on top 
                        of Barbara Stanwyck.

           Ramirez looks down to see that his friend is bleeding 
           over Barbara’s handprints and autograph.

           EXT. ROOF OF THE DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS

           Neddy Herbert angles his BAR, putting the SIGHTS ON 
           RAMIREZ. His finger taking the slack off the trigger, 
           preparing to take Ramirez’s head off, when- 

           Washington flicks his SWITCHBLADE, and holy-shit, THROWS 
           the knife all the way across the street, the blade 
           buzzing, arcing, as it spins through the air to- 

           -shickt!- Herbert’s SIGHT WOBBLES. He looks down at the 
           STILETTO buried to the hilt in his sternum. He drops his 
           BAR, pin-wheeling his arms, falling off the roof. Done.

                                 KENNARD
                        Much obliged.

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Don’t mention it.
           INT. 12TH FLOOR ROOSEVELT - NIGHT

           Hearing the GUNFIRE outside, Cohen looks shaken, somehow 
           smaller, his empire crumbling around him. Lennox grabs 
           the Carcano rifle and leads Cohen to the elevator, GUNMEN 
           flanking him like Secret Service agents. 

           INT. ROOSEVELT LOBBY - NIGHT

           O’Mara FIRES from behind his pillar, engaging the two 
           remaining gunmen. Wrevock stalks toward Wooters, firing 
           just above Wooter’s head with his STEN gun. Sitting up 
           against his pillar, Wooters tourniquets his belt around 
           his bleeding leg and teeth-cinches it. Strips out his 
           empty drum magazine, and taps it against his head, 
           SIGNALLING to O’Mara that he’s out of ammo. Wrevock is 
           closing in on him.

           Other two gunmen continue to pound O’Mara, pinning him. 
           O’Mara has no shot at Wrevock and no unobstructed path to 
           toss Wooters a spare magazine. That pillar is in the way.

                                 O’MARA
                        Jerry!

           O’Mara CHUCKS the drum magazine with force enough to 
           BOUNCE it off the PILLAR, the drum ricocheting, like a 
           BANK SHOT right into Wooters’ upheld palm! Wooters SLAMS 
           the fresh drum into his weapon, ROLLS out from behind the 
           pillar, RAKING Wrevock, tracers setting his clothes 
           aflame, knocking him back over the bell desk. 

           Now the ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and two hissing SMOKE 
           GRENADES roll out into the lobby, GREEN SMOKE roils, like 
           the coming of the Wicked Witch. Lennox and a Mechanic 
           COME OUT FIRING at O’Mara, pinning him down. O’Mara sees 
           Cohen is with them, taking cover by the elevator. But 
           O’Mara’s trapped by gunfire. He can’t get to Cohen.

           O’Mara turns and EMPTIES HIS MAGAZINE straight into the 
           WALL next to him, stitching an oblong circle in the 
           plaster, which he now LEAPS through-

           -into the NEXT ROOM- his weapon empty. O’Mara TOSSES it 
           as he RUNS out into the HALLWAY, empty handed. Appearing 
           BEHIND Cohen. Lennox and the mechanic still busy trading 
           rounds with Wooters, who’s hunched down against a pillar. 

           O’Mara HOOKS his arm around Lennox’s throat in a choke 
           hold, and YANKS him backward. Cohen spinning around, his 
           gun on O’Mara now. No shot. And O’Mara sees Lennox 
           reaching down for his Carcano. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           O’Mara STOMPS down on Lennox’s rifle with his left foot 
           and KICKS with his right, aiming at Lennox’s face. 

           But Lennox blocks O’Mara’s kick, coming up at O’Mara with 
           his brass-knuckle TRENCH KNIFE, O’Mara TWISTS, taking the 
           blade in his left arm, PUNCHING Lennox with his right. 
           Lennox takes the punch, GRABS the Carcano, raising it-

           -Wooters SHOOTS Mechanic dead. Wooters scoots on the 
           floor from one pillar to another, trailing blood from his 
           leg, trying to find a shot without hitting O’Mara... when 
           Wooters FIRES, his shot just grazing Lennox’s arm, 
           setting fire to his sleeve. 

           Lennox grabs Cohen, hustling Cohen out through the 
           swirling smoke past Wooters amid the gunfire.

           EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Ramirez and Washington FIRE, forcing Lennox and Cohen 
           behind a parked car. Tracers sizzling into the car, 
           setting FIRE to it. Lennox fires back at Ramirez. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS

           Ramirez’s Thompson JAMS. Kennard can’t stand, but he 
           concentrates. He tilts his revolver, dumps empties out of 
           the CYLINDER. Kennard has only ONE left. 

                                 KENNARD
                        How many rounds left in that drum? 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        One.

           Coughing, Kennard loads the last tracer into his 
           Peacemaker. That makes two rounds. 

                                 KENNARD
                        Get down here an help me aim.
                        Let’s don’t let ‘em get by us.

           I/E. ROOSEVELT HOTEL

           O’Mara pulls the knife out of his arm, picks the gun up 
           off the floor and runs out. Wooters struggles to his 
           feet, following O’Mara-
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS

           -right into Lennox’s line of fire. Lennox turns his 
           Carcano on O’Mara. BAM! BAM! BAM! O’Mara dives behind a 
           parked car as Lennox fires the Carcano’s GRENADE. Cunk-
           Kaboom! PARKED CAR next to him lifts off the street in a 
           BALL of FLAME, knocking O’Mara sideways into a lamp post. 

           High-pitched RINGING FILLS O’Mara’s world, his fingers 
           scrape the wet street. He sees Cohen, tries to pick 
           himself up to go after him, but his equilibrium is gone.

           Washington fires until his Thompson clicks EMPTY. 

           Wooters LIMPS painfully, FIRING his Thompson one-handed.

           But no one has a good angle on Lennox as he RUNS across 
           the flaming wreckage toward O’Mara, putting the Carcano 
           to his shoulder. Ramirez helps Kennard aim his Peacemaker 
           and Kennard FIRES, missing Lennox by a mile. 

                                 KENNARD
                        Not where the sumbitch is, 
                        goddamnit.
                                 (coughing)
                        Where he’s gonna be.

           Lennox opens the bolt to see he’s got a ROUND left for 
           O’Mara. He RAISES the rifle, grinning his Kodiak grin 
           down at O’Mara, his FINGER squeezing the trigger. BOOM! A 
           strange red LIGHT suddenly emanates from Lennox’s chest, 
           like E.T. He falls to his knees, the tracer bullet 
           turning his chest into a Japanese lantern.

           Ramirez looks down at the Peacemaker. They did it.

                                 KENNARD (CONT’D)
                        That’s my boy ... Here.

           Kennard removes his gunbelt.

                                 KENNARD (CONT’D)
                        Wear it in good health.

           Coughing, Kennard hands his rig over to Ramirez. He 
           smiles through pain. The coughing becomes convulsing and 
           he dies. Washington closes Kennard’s eyes. 

           Cohen stares at the wreckage. He can’t run now. Wooters 
           helps O’Mara to his feet. O’Mara, Wooters, Washington and 
           Ramirez converge on Cohen, like a collapsing star. Cohen 
           raises his gun at O’Mara. O’Mara raises his. Silence. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 O’MARA
                        Mickey Cohen. You’re under arrest. 
                        For the murder of Jack Whalen.

           Cohen smiles demonically, tossing the gun aside.

                                 COHEN
                        Well, what’re you waitin’ for, 
                        lawman? Take me in.

           O’Mara tosses his gun, raises his fists. None of the 
           others make a move. His eyes tell them not to interfere. 

                                 WOOTERS
                        Put him down, Sarge.

           THE FIGHT’S ON! Cohen and O’Mara trade savage punches. 
           O’Mara’s battle-honed hand-to-hand versus Cohen’s years 
           in the ring, the streets. A clash of professional 
           warriors. Cohen adept not in Eastern fighting style, but 
           highly skilled western ones. And O’Mara’s injured.

           SIRENS. BLACK & WHITES and FIRE TRUCKS arriving. The 
           squad holds back a crowd of UNIFORMS, CIVILIANS, 
           murmuring, pointing. Jesus, that’s Mickey Cohen!

                                 WASHINGTON
                        Stay BACK. Give ‘em room.

           Cohen PUNCHES the knife wound in O’Mara’s arm. Arrgh! 
           O’Mara clinches and Cohen comes to the body, ribs, 
           kidneys. O’Mara’s eyes roll, sucking wind, but he somehow 
           manages to keep his feet. A ring of people watching now. 

           O’Mara HEADBUTTS Cohen, dips his shoulder to hook his 
           right arm between Cohen’s legs, grabbing Cohen’s collar 
           with his left fist. And with a roar, O’MARA LIFTS COHEN 
           UP OFF HIS FEET, HOLDING HIM FLAILING AND KICKING OVER 
           O’MARA’S HEAD. The crowd gasp. And O’Mara THROWS him down 
           in the street. Cohen’s head bouncing off the asphalt, 
           dazed, blinking at the crowd of ANGELENOS around him...  

           ...At their FACES, and the relief flooding them, the veil 
           of fear lifting. The nightmare finally over. Awestruck, 
           grateful. Smiling. The witch is dead. Hail Dorothy.

                                 O’MARA
                                 (panting)
                        Take him away.

           We PULL BACK from the wreckage on Hollywood Boulevard.

           A GRUMMAN SEAPLANE soars past the CASINO BUILDING and 
           kisses down on the blue waters Avalon harbor. JOHN and 
           CONNIE O’MARA are building a sand castle with their six-
           month old DAUGHTER. Connie points to the seaplane. 

           O’Mara catches sight of a milk-skinned BLONDE walking by 
           on the arm of a young SAILOR in dress whites. She doesn’t 
           look back at O’Mara as they stroll past him. O’Mara 
           watches them. Couldn’t be OUR Blonde, could it? Doesn’t 
           matter. She reminds O’Mara of what he’s accomplished. 

                                 CONNIE
                                 (smiling)
                        Eyes front, Sergeant.

           O’Mara smiles, kissing his wife. Finally at peace. 

           *AND WE HEAR MODERN LAPD RADIO TRAFFIC PRELAPPING...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           TIGHT ON: A BLACK & WHITE PHOTO, but we’re so close to it 
           the faces appear pixelated, too blurry to make out, until 
           we PULL BACK to reveal it’s a DIGITAL copy of a copy of 
           an old UNIT PHOTO of the ACTUAL GANGSTER SQUAD... 

           PULLING FURTHER BACK to reveal that the photo of the 
           squad is just one picture, half-forgotten, on a WALL 
           covered with photos: CRASH UNIT PHOTOS, generations of 
           eager young GANG COPS posing around SEIZED DOPE and GUNS. 
           DIVISIONAL SOFTBALL TEAMS, the BAKER TO VEGAS LAW 
           ENFORCEMENT RELAY RACES. COMMENDATIONS. GANG BANDANAS 
           pinned to the wall like Comanche Scalps.       

           We’re in the cramped office of the 77TH DIVISION GANG 
           UNIT, hardly more than a closet, underfunded, ignored. We 
           follow LAPD GANG COPS hustling out of the office...

           EXT. 77TH DIVISION - SUNSET

           And into their BLACK & WHITES. SIRENS WAIL as the cars 
           head out into LA. Dry palm trees over graffiti-covered 
           apartments. LAPD CHOPPERS circle in a beautiful sunset... 

                                          THE END
