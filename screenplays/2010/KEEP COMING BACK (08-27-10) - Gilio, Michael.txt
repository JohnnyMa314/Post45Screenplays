           A BIG GUY

           Stares at us, getting a good read.  His name is JAMES FEARING 
           (30’s).

           And sitting across from him, in a La-Z-Boy chair, is a thirty-
           two year old man.  

           His name is MARK.  

           The year is 1992.  

                                 JAMES
                        You look comfortable, is that 
                        comfortable?

                                 MARK
                        Sure.

                                 JAMES
                        Does it, like, recline?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah.

           Mark reclines.

                                 JAMES
                        Nice.

           Mark returns to an upright position.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        So, maybe you know why I’m here.

                                 MARK
                        I think so, sure.

                                 JAMES
                        My name is James--

           He reaches to shake Mark’s hand, knocking over a bunch of 
           empty beer cans with a sudden CRASH.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, sorry.

                                 MARK
                        No, it’s cool.

           James tidies up, methodically stacking the cans (there’s a 
           lot of them).  

           Then.
                                 JAMES
                        Listen.  I don’t wanna waste your 
                        time, so why don’t we just get to 
                        it and I’ll be outta your hair, OK?

                                 MARK
                        Sure.

           Beat.

                                 JAMES
                        You drink, what, beer?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, beer mostly.

                                 JAMES
                        How many?

                                 MARK
                        Couple a day.

                                 JAMES
                        Couple a day.  Where, like with 
                        your buddies, watching the game 
                        kinda thing?

                                 MARK
                        Nah, not really.

                                 JAMES
                        Where do you drink?

                                 MARK
                        Usually here, or ... in my car.

                                 JAMES
                        In your car.  

                                 MARK
                        Sometimes.

                                 JAMES
                        What, you got like a case under the 
                        seat, or--

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, under the seat like.

                                 JAMES
                        And you just toss the empties, 
                        where?
                                 MARK
                        In the trunk.

                                 JAMES
                        Toss the empties in the trunk, 
                        sure.  You drink alone?

                                 MARK
                        Mostly.  Yeah.

                                 JAMES
                        Alone in the car.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah.

                                 JAMES
                        Hm.

           Silence.  James thinks.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        So, whattayou think, Mark.

                                 MARK
                        What.

                                 JAMES
                        You drink alone in your car and you  
                        toss the empties in the trunk.

           Stares.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Whattayou think?

                                 MARK
                        Well, you know, that’s ... probably 
                        not normal.

                                 JAMES
                        Ya think?

                                 MARK
                        ... no ...

                                 JAMES
                        Here’s what we’re gonna do.

           Leans in real close.
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        There’s Plan A-- which I highly 
                        recommend.  And then there’s Plan 
                        B.  Now, Plan A’s got rope swings.  
                        You like rope swings?

                                 MARK
                        Rope swings?  Yeah.

                                 JAMES
                        Plan A’s got rope swings.  Lounging 
                        by the pool kinda thing.  Tennis 
                        courts, a fireplace-- I’ve done 
                        Plan A.  I like Plan A.  It’s like 
                        a big country club in Wisconsin, 
                        which is gorgeous this time of 
                        year, by the way.  Chilled out, 
                        cleared my head, cuz back then, man- 
                        I was struggling just to keep up 
                        appearances, right? 
                             (beat)
                        Maybe you know what I mean.

           Mark bites his lip. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Maybe not.

                                 MARK
                        What’s Plan B?

                                 JAMES
                        You don’t want Plan B.

                                 MARK
                        Why?

                                 JAMES
                        You don’t want Plan B.

                                 MARK
                        Maybe I do.

                                 JAMES
                        Plan B ... 

           A HUGE SHOE lands with a THUD on a coffee table.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        --involves my size 13’s.

           Mark stares.
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Whattaya think.  Chill out for a 
                        month.  Re-lax.   

                                 MARK
                        I mean, that sounds nice, but--

           A PHONE slides across the table.

                                 JAMES
                        Let’s give em a call.

                                 MARK
                        I dunno, I just lost my job and I 
                        can’t really afford something like 
                        that.

           James turns to Mark’s wife, SHARON (30’s), who’s been 
           standing there all along.

                                 JAMES
                        Can he afford it?

                                 SHARON
                        It’s covered.

                                 JAMES
                        Your wife says it’s covered.

                                 MARK
                             (to Sharon)
                        Where you gettin that kind of 
                        money?

           James slips a pamphlet into Mark’s hand.

                                 JAMES
                        There’s the number.

                                 MARK
                        How would I even get there--

                                 JAMES
                        I’ll take you.

           Silence.  There’s nothing more. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t we give em a call.

           Mark bites his lip again.
                                 MARK
                             (to Sharon)
                        If I go ... will you--

                                 SHARON
                        That’s not fair.

                                 JAMES
                        Your wife loves you very much.

                                 MARK
                        She’s divorcing me.  I dunno.

                                 JAMES
                        Let me ask you one more question.

           Beat.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        What are you pretending not to 
                        know, Mark?

           Mark blinks.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        What are you pretending not to 
                        know?

           Mark’s eyes well up and he breaks down.  Hard.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        C’mere.

           James leans over, KNOCKING the stack of empty beer cans 
           again, wrapping Mark in a huge bear hug and smothering his 
           face.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Let’s do this.

           WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:  

           EXT. A SUBURBAN HOME - MINNEAPOLIS, MN. - DAY

           Garage door open, cars in the street.  

           A makeshift den.

           And sitting among the free weights, air hockey table and a 
           stray pizza box, Mark slowly dials the number on the 
           pamphlet.
                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m a sad man.

           OFF-SCREEN LAUGHTER.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        No, seriously, I am.  I’m a deeply 
                        unsatisfied person.

           INT. AIRPORT BAR - NIGHT

           A small, dark bar packed with men in suits.  

           Mark is hammered.  

           A dozen or so beer bottles are lined up on the counter, his 
           face near purple with laughter:  James dances “The Running 
           Man,” working his way through the crowd, approaching Mark 
           with a single bottle of beer.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        I was ruined as a little boy.  
                        Holly Fitzgerald.  You guys know 
                        who I’m talking about.

           MORE OFF-SCREEN LAUGHTER

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t touch her, did you?  Cuz 
                        I’ll kill you.  I will.

           LAUGHTER AGAIN (sounds of a comedy club?)

           James hands Mark the beer.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (over the music)
                        This is your last one, my man.

           INT. AIRPLANE - MOVING - NIGHT

           Economy Class.

           Mark is passed out on James’s shoulder, the entire cabin dark 
           except a single light above James:  he’s engrossed in a 
           magazine or something, a pen aloft ...  

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        She was the girl who undressed with 
                        the shades open, right?
           A catalog.  CLOSE-UP: a photo of an luxury leather briefcase.

           He circles it.

           EXT. RECOVERY CENTER - OCONOMOWOC, WI. - DAY

           Mark steps out of a cab, hung-over, looking at a squat, 
           concrete fortress:  an insane asylum (or certainly looks like 
           one).

                                 MARK
                        Whoa, wait a minute--

           James throws an arm around Mark and muscles him towards the 
           entrance.

           INT. RECOVERY CENTER - DAY

           Patient intake.

           Mark just stands there, staring at the near-empty Visiting 
           Room, a TV blaring a Roadrunner cartoon to no one.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        She was the girl who sunbathed on 
                        the front lawn, you get the idea.

           A friendly-looking WOMAN takes Mark’s hand with a smile.

                                 WOMAN
                             (sing-song)
                        Hi, I’m Beverly.  Why don’t we--

           And she ushers him down a long, endless hallway, Mark looking 
           back at James over his shoulder.

           James gives him a Thumbs Up and a Wink.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Sharon sits beside her FATHER (60’s), counting out several 
           hundred dollar bills, slapping them down on the kitchen 
           table.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        And I’m convinced that God put this 
                        girl, Holly, on the planet to test 
                        me.

           OFF-SCREEN LAUGHTER
                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Keep laughing, but I’m serious.

           James scoops up the wad of cash and pockets it, vigorously 
           shaking the man’s hand.

                                                                CUT TO:

           AN ITALIAN LEATHER MEN’S BRIEFCASE

           Swinging at James’ side, as he swaggers out of the Mall of 
           America.  

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        Cuz if she’s not part of some 
                        larger plan, then I am truly lost.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE SAME LEATHER BRIEFCASE

           Now resting on a podium.  A church basement.  An AA Meeting.  

           And James stands before fifty or so AAs, continuing to lead a 
           “speaker meeting.”

           MARK sits in the front row, a nervous newbie.

                                 JAMES 
                        She was a demon.

           LAUGHTER.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        She was.  I met Holly at a birthday 
                        party for a buddy of mine ...

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The BUDDY of his (14) is being spun in circles beneath a 
           unicorn pinata, blindfolded.  He grips a big whiffle bat.  

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        And she just plopped down right 
                        next to me ...

           A fourteen-year old James Fearing (ratty jeans, Allman Bros. 
           T-shirt) and a fourteen-year old HOLLY FITZGERALD (designer 
           jean-skirt, pert, WASP), sit side by side, a quilt covering 
           their laps.
                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Grabbed my hand and ...

           BENEATH THE BLANKET:  James has his hand beneath Holly’s 
           skirt, rubbing the crotch of her tights.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           JAMES - AA MEETING 

           He stares in the mid-distance ... 

                                 JAMES
                        It was ... I dunno.

           The meeting gets real quiet.  (A cough)  

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        But I know this ... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A CLOSET

           James and Holly make-out behind a row of winter jackets, 
           tongues deep in each others’ mouths.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        It was Holly that gave me my first 
                        drink.

           She takes a swig from a BOTTLE OF GIN and offers it to him.  

           He takes a sniff.  

           Then ... 

           Takes a swig.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And that was it.

           Holly rips open his shirt, buttons popping, and breathes hard 
           into his ear-- 

                                 HOLLY
                        I wanna lick your guts.

           James pulls back, wide-eyed.
                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        Something happened to me that 
                        night.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           A FOLDED NOTE

           With Mark’s name on it, quietly passing from hand to hand, 
           landing at Mark.

                                 JAMES
                        It was my First.  The First Drink, 
                        the First Hit, the First Kiss, the 
                        First.

           He unfolds it:  “Easy does it”

           Looks up at James.  James WINKS at him, That’s for you.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        And we all know I didn’t have a 
                        fighting chance.

           Solemn nods, Amen, Mark nodding too, watching and following 
           the group’s cues. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        But we had a great time, didn’t we?

           Laughter.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Until we didn’t.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE CLOSET DOORS

           Sliding open with a SLAM.

                                 HOLLY
                        Daddy, no!

           And HOLLY’S DAD (30’s), a man with a mustache, reaches into 
           the dark and YANKS James out in the open.  

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        I swear to God, I couldn’t get 
                        enough of this girl.
           INT. CAFETERIA - HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Prom.  

           A wonderland of streamers.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        I tried other girls over the years.

           A sixteen-year old James (in a rented tux) and his bored, 
           skinny GIRLFRIEND (a pink dress) sit at a cafeteria table.

           They both blankly watch HOLLY, sitting across from them, 
           devour some big, handsome QUARTERBACK, her mouth and hands 
           all over him.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But there was only one Holly.

           UNDER THE TABLE:  Holly slips her bare foot up James’s pant 
           leg.  She drowsily opens her eyes, watches him, making sure 
           he’s paying attention, smiles, and then closes her eyes 
           again, working over her date.

           James blinks.  

           He wordlessly stands up ... and PUNCHES the Quarterback.

           INT. HOLLY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           An eighteen-year old James and Holly are half-naked in her 
           single bed, DRUNK, passing a bottle of wine between them.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        My life made sense with Holly.

           A KNOCK at the door, the handle jiggling, locked, and they 
           scramble to their clothes-- 

           HOLLY’S DAD busts down the door (his moustache a bit gray 
           now), charges at James and YANKS him out the door. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Daddy, no!

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        My life had purpose with Holly.

                                                                CUT TO:
           THE FITZGERALD MANOR

           James is tossed out the front door, barefoot, his shirt 
           ripped and Holly watches from her third floor bedroom window.

           Holly’s Dad rolls up his sleeves, squaring off with James.

                                 HOLLY’S DAD
                        You stay the hell away from my--

           James PUNCHES him, suddenly, a wild throw and they both fall 
           to the grass, wrestling on the front lawn.

                                 HOLLY
                        Daddy, no!

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        I was to get trashed.  Every day.  
                        All day.  Till I die.

                                                                CUT TO:

           JAMES

           Slamming a beer, sitting beside a beach campfire, a guitar in 
           his lap.  

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        But God had a plan, he does, I’m 
                        here to tell you ...

           And through the flames of the fire, a cute COLLEGE GIRL 
           stares at James over the rim of her plastic cup.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        “Wake up Maggie, I think I got 
                        something to say to you--”

           Maggie May by Rod Stewart.  

           Kids are leaving, booing, a beer can hits James’ guitar, but 
           he doesn’t stop ...

           And she doesn’t move.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Her name was Colleen.
           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           James and Colleen sit next to each other now, alone.

                                 COLLEEN
                        How can you say that?!  

                                 JAMES
                        Listen, I don’t expect you to 
                        understand Blazing Saddles--

           They lean into each other, fiercely debating, eyes bright 
           with excitement.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        She didn’t take any of my bullshit.

           JAMES AND COLLEEN

           Stroll along the lake shore, the sun rising, still arguing.

                                 COLLEEN
                        That is COMPLETELY insane.

                                 JAMES
                        It’s the truth, though, right?

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        She stopped me dead in my tracks.

           PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Kids shuffle back to their cars, hung-over, and James 
           awkwardly stands at Colleen’s car, her GIRLFRIENDS half-
           asleep in the backseat.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And for a guy like me, who was 
                        racing for the finish line--

           He LUNGES FOR HER--  and she quickly pulls back.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Going in for the kill, huh.

           Dumb stare.

                                 JAMES
                        No.

           Runs his hand through his hair.
                                 COLLEEN
                        You got my number, right?

                                 JAMES
                        Sure.

                                 COLLEEN
                        OK, then.

           She hops in her car.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Use it.

           And she drives off.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        We were married a year later.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           JAMES - PRESENT

           A big smile.

                                 JAMES
                        And I never saw Holly again.  She 
                        was shipped off to some fancy 
                        university and that was that.
                             (beat)
                        Except once.

                                                                CUT TO:

           AN AUDITORIUM

           A ten-year high-school reunion.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        I was pretending to be a normie, 
                        then.

           A twenty-seven year old James (beer in hand) and Colleen sit 
           at a dinner table.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But not Holly.

           HOLLY sits across from them, throwing back a shot, her arm 
           loosely hung over a big, HANDSOME GUY.
                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        She hadn’t changed at all.

           Colleen silently watches her husband as he animatedly talks 
           to Holly, leaning close, touching her arm.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It was like we were in high school 
                        all over again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DARK HALLWAY

           Lined with lockers, music quietly coming from the auditorium.  

           And at the end of the long, dark hallway, TWO SILHOUETTES 
           huddle close together.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        And even though I had convinced 
                        myself that I had everything under 
                        control--  I was married, working a 
                        job, looking to the future ...

           James and Holly greedily kiss, their mouths all over each 
           other, breathing hard.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I was lost.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Jim? 

           James quickly pulls away, caught, revealing:  

           COLLEEN. 

           Just standing there, eyes wet, clutching her purse. 

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           JAMES - PRESENT

           A big sigh.

                                 JAMES
                        I finally checked myself into 
                        treatment ...
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAMES (CONT'D)
                        See, I’m committed to the service, 
                        working the steps, thankful to be 
                        alive, but I gotta tell ya-- it’s 
                        not easy.

           It gets quiet again.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        When you’re eleven years sober, the 
                        Holly Fitzgeralds of the world only 
                        get farther and farther from your 
                        grasp, Thank God, but here’s the 
                        kicker:  She will always be a part 
                        of us.  

           He stares at the audience for a moment, as if he’s going to 
           say something else ...

           Then.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Keep coming back.  Thank you.

           APPLAUSE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MARK 

           Walking fast, moving through a large group of AAs (all 
           smoking) and into the church parking lot.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, man, hold up.

           SOMEONE jogs after him, Mark picking up the pace, pretending 
           not to hear--

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        MARK.

           And Mark STOPS, caught, a MAN stepping up to him with an 
           outstretched hand--   

                                 MAN
                        Hey.  I’m Potts.

                                 MARK
                        Hey.

           They shake.  

                                 POTTS
                        First meeting, huh?
                                 MARK
                        Yeah.

                                 POTTS
                        Got a sponsor yet?

                                 MARK
                        Yep.

                                 POTTS
                        Really? 

                                 MARK
                        No, not yet, but ... yeah. 

           A shrug.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I should probably--

                                 POTTS
                        Why don’t you come out with us?

                                 MARK
                        No, I got some ... stuff.

                                 POTTS
                        James wants to check in with you,
                        see how you’re doin.

                                 MARK
                        I can’t right now.

                                 POTTS
                        Cup of coffee, meet the Gang.

                                 MARK
                        I can’t.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ORIGINAL PANCAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mark sits in a booth.  

           James, Potts and CHIEF (70’s), a silent AA Old-timer, sit 
           across from Mark, watching him.

           He shifts in his seat.

                                 JAMES
                        Fire in them eyes ...
           They all solemnly nod.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You got fire in them eyes, Mark.

                                 MARK
                        Allergies.

                                 JAMES
                        Talk to me.

                                 MARK
                        Nothing to talk about, really.  

                                 JAMES
                        You did treatment.

                                 MARK
                        Yep.

                                 JAMES
                        How you feelin.

                                 MARK
                        Fine.  Good.

           Mark shifts in his seat again.

                                 JAMES
                        What’d you think of tonight’s 
                        meeting?

                                 MARK
                        Fine.  

           Nods and smiles.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Listen.  You guys seem like cool 
                        guys ... 

                                 JAMES
                        We are.

                                 MARK
                        But I’m just not feeling it, this 
                        whole AA thing.  I mean, no 
                        offense, but I got, like, real 
                        issues.
                             (beat)
                        The divorce.

           Nothing.
                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Lost my job ... 

           Still nothing.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Losing my house, my kid, so--

                                 JAMES
                        You’re an alcoholic.

                                 MARK
                        I’m not.  Anymore.

                                 JAMES
                        You are.

                                 MARK
                        I did treatment.

                                 JAMES
                        It’s called alcholism, not 
                        alcoholwasm.

                                 MARK
                        Well, I’m not like you guys, OK, 
                        with all your God talk and “inner 
                        treasure”--  I’m done.  That’s 
                        over.  Now I just gotta, like, get 
                        my life back together.

                                 JAMES
                             (waving)
                        Excuse me.

           Their WAITRESS (20’s) steps up.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Whoa.  Who are you?

                                 WAITRESS
                        Allison.

                                 JAMES
                        You’re new.  Welcome Allison.  This 
                        is Mark, he’s single, and this is 
                        Potts (Hello) that’s Chief (a nod) 
                        and I’m James ...

           Hands her a business card.
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        We’d like to get an order of potato 
                        skins and mozzarella sticks--  
                        wait.  Does this Sampler thing ... 
                             (reads the menu)
                        No, no, let’s get this.  Let’s just 
                        get the Sampler, and--
                             (to Mark)
                        Coffee?
                             (he nods)
                        Four coffees.  And I want a vanilla 
                        milk shake.

                                 ALLISON
                        We don’t have--

                                 JAMES
                        NO!  
                             (SLAMS the table)
                        All right.  Let’s just get one of 
                        those huge slices of carrot cake.  
                        For everyone. 

                                 ALLISON
                        You got it.

           She leaves.

                                 JAMES
                        You’re not special, Mark.

           Mark blinks.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Those are some high quality 
                        problems you got there, but they 
                        don’t impress me.

                                 POTTS
                        “Terminal uniqueness.”

           Chief gravely nods.

                                 JAMES
                        They’re dying all around us, Potts, 
                        of terminal uniqueness.

           A muffled RING.  James reaches into his briefcase, lifting a 
           huge plastic brick to his ear:  A Motorola MOBILE PHONE.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Dr. James Fearing ... 
                             (rolls his eyes)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Bullets, Dee, bullets ...
                        Get the digits, close it up, then 
                        call me. 
                             (covers the mouthpiece)
                        You want a job?

                                 MARK
                        Really?

                                 JAMES
                        I’m hanging up, Dee.  I’m doin it, 
                        it’s coming, here it comes--

           He hangs up.  

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You’re hired.

                                 MARK
                        Wow.  Thank you.

                                 JAMES
                        On one condition ...

           Leans in.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’m your sponsor.

           Another muffled RING.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Hold that thought.

           James answers the enormous phone again.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Dr. James Fearing.
                             (he deflates)
                        Picking us up some food, baby, did 
                        you want that carrot cake?

           He throws down a handful of bills, pushing Potts and Chief 
           out of the booth.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        No, I’m in the car, coming down the 
                        street right now, bye.

           He hangs up, the Gang standing over Mark.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Whattaya say, I’m throwing you a 
                        life jacket, here.   
                                 MARK
                        Let me think about it.

                                 JAMES
                        We’re over here in a boat and 
                        you’re out there treading water.

                                 MARK
                        What would I have to do?

                                 JAMES
                        Simple.  I’m in charge.  You do as 
                        I say and you don’t leave my side 
                        till I put out that fire in your 
                        eyes.

                                 MARK
                        I don’t even know what that means.

                                 JAMES
                        What do you want, Mark?

           A shrug.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        What. Do you. Want?

                                 MARK
                        I want my life back.

                                 JAMES
                        Then get off your ass.  

           An outstretched hand.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        And get on the firing line.  Deal?

           And with much reluctance, Mark takes it.

                                 MARK
                        Deal.

           They shake.

           INT. SMALL SUBURBAN HOME - PLYMOUTH, MN. - NIGHT

           James opens the front door a sliver, peeking in.

                                 JAMES
                        Heeelloooo?
           Nothing.

           He sneaks in, carrying a plastic LASER TAG GUN, Mark 
           shuffling in behind him, holding take-out bags--

           A SCREAM

           And two little TODDLERS, a boy and a girl, charge for James, 
           screaming and firing Photon guns.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        OhmiGOD, NOOO!

           He dives into the foyer, zapping his kids in mid-air, hitting 
           the floor with a LOUD THUD, and the kids overwhelm him, 
           giggling and crawling all over his chest.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You got me.

           Mark just stands there, staring at the kids-- longingly.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Alright, you two.

           COLLEEN (30’s) stands at the top of a stairway.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Into bed, let’s go.

                                 JAMES
                        Listen to your Mother, chillens.

           They climb off.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Slobbers.

           They kiss him and he stands, Mark watching the kids stomp 
           upstairs, past their Mother.

                                 COLLEEN
                        You know that phone that costs us a 
                        thousand bucks a month?

                                 JAMES
                        Yes.

                                 COLLEEN
                        It’d be nice if you used it to call 
                        me, let us know when--
                                 JAMES
                        Making money, baby, making money.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Cuz you got kids here that wait up 
                        for you, I don’t know if you know 
                        that.

                                 JAMES
                        Colleen.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Do I need to set a curfew for you?  
                        C’mon, don’t make me hunt you down.

           He points the laser gun at her.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Jim.  See this?
                             (re: her face)
                        This is Serious Colleen.

                                 JAMES
                        How you doin upstairs, you want 
                        some company?

                                 COLLEEN
                             (re: Mark)
                        Who’s this?

                                 MARK
                             (blurts)
                        You have a lovely house and family, 
                        Mrs. Fearing.

           A frozen smile.  Weird beat.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Thank you.  Try convincing your new 
                        best friend there.
                             (turns on a heel)
                        There’s pillows in the hall closet.

                                 JAMES
                        Carrot cake?

           A door slam. 

           And a heavy sigh.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Working my way back into the Big 
                        Bed.
           He turns to Mark ... 

           He’s gone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MARK   

           Walking fast down a suburban street, juggling the take-out 
           bags, James coming after him.

                                 JAMES
                        Where do you think you’re goin, 
                        Mark.

                                 MARK
                        I gotta get home.

           He rushes for a parked Datsun, fumbling with his keys.

                                 JAMES
                        We made a deal, remember?

                                 MARK
                        I know, but, I gotta do something.

           The keys hit the pavement--

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Mark bends over, quickly snatching the keys, What are you 
           doin, Mark?, James SPRINTING at him now and Mark unlocks the 
           car, ducks inside and SLAMS THE DOOR just as James BANGS up 
           against the window-

                                 JAMES
                        DON’T YOU RUN AWAY FROM ME!

                                 MARK
                        Leave me alone.

           The car roars to life, James banging on the windows and Mark 
           guns it, SCREECHING down the street.

                                                                CUT TO:

           TAKE-OUT BAGS

           Tumbling out of an open car door, a FOOT stepping into the 
           carrot cake and Mark shakes it off, racing up the driveway.
           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

           The front door BURSTS OPEN, Mark standing in the foyer for a 
           moment, eyes wild, looking up the staircase.

                                 MARK
                        SHARON?!

                                                                CUT TO:

           ANOTHER DOOR 

           Banging open, a SCREAM, Sharon pulling the covers up to her 
           neck and sitting upright in a bed.

                                 SHARON
                        What the hell are you doin--

                                 MARK
                        Don’t be mad.

                                 SHARON
                        You’re not supposed to be here.

                                 MARK
                        Five minutes.

                                 SHARON
                        You have to leave, now.

                                 MARK
                        Two minutes.

                                 SHARON
                        Mark.  

                                 MARK
                        I stopped drinking.

                                 SHARON
                        I know.

                                 MARK
                        I’m totally cured.  I am.  I don’t 
                        want to drink anymore, and, and--  
                        I got myself a job, an accounting 
                        job.

                                 SHARON
                        You did?
                                 MARK
                        Great firm, good pay, picking up 
                        exactly where I left off and I’m 
                        thinkin I could move back in, just, 
                        like, for a little while and see 
                        how that goes ...

           She softens.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I’ll move into the garage if you 
                        like, that’s no problem, not a 
                        problem at all, whattayou think.

           They stare at each other.

                                 SHARON
                        Honey.  

                                 MARK
                        Please.

                                 SHARON
                        You have to leave.

                                 MARK
                        But I don’t want to.

           A silence.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        How’s Max?

                                 SHARON
                        Sad.

           A TERRIFYING SCREECH

           Comes from outside, and Mark scurries to the window, pulling 
           at the curtain, looking down at the front lawn:  JAMES.  

           He hops out of his car (still running) and sprints for the 
           front door. 

                                 MARK
                        Oh, no. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mark quickly enters a dark, little room and shuts the door a 
           crack, peering out.
           KNOCKING and BANGING from downstairs.

                                 VOICE (O.S)
                        Daddy?

           A young voice.

                                 MARK
                        Oh, hey, kiddo, shhhhh.  Try to be 
                        quiet, ok?

           His four-year old son, MAX, sits upright in a racing-car bed.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Wow, I really like your bed.  Did 
                        you just get this?

           A tiny nod.  Mark sits down beside him.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        It’s cool.

                                 MAX
                        Are you staying?

                                 MARK
                        No.  Not tonight, Max.

                                 MAX
                        When are you coming back?

                                 MARK
                        Soon, kiddo, soon.

           A kiss to the forehead.  MORE BANGING from downstairs.

                                 MARK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You go to sleep, OK?  

                                 MAX
                        OK.

           Mark goes back to the door, peeking out-- a silent, empty 
           hallway.

           Turns back to Max.

                                 MARK
                        Love you.

           But he’s already asleep.

                                                                CUT TO:
           MARK   

           Moving stealth-like down the hallway stairs, James’ booming 
           VOICE coming from somewhere in the house, Sharon speaking to 
           him in hushed tones--

           Mark bolts for the front door.

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        Hey, hey, hey, where you goin?!

                                                                CUT TO:

           MARK SPRINTING

           His arms and legs pumping, tearing down the dark, suburban 
           street, the sound of heavy footfalls behind him, getting 
           louder and closer--

                                 JAMES
                        We made a deal.

           Louder and closer and louder and closer and James takes--

           A RUNNING LEAP

           TACKLING Mark, their bodies hitting the ground, HARD.

                                 MARK
                        --the FUCK?!

           They roll over together and James straddles Mark’s back, 
           pulling at his arms-- 

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        What are you--

           Click.

           Handcuffs. 

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        You’re handcuffing me, you can’t 
                        handcuff me--

                                 JAMES
                        --the hell I can’t.

           Pulls him to his feet.
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’m a doctor.

           INT. REC ROOM - FEARING HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           James lies on a pull-out bed, wrapped in a sleeping bag and 
           picking at the smashed carrot cake, absently watching the 
           local news.

           Mark sits on the edge of the bed, the Big Book in his lap, 
           his hands cuffed to a side table.

                                 MARK
                        Could you just- please, undo these?

                                 JAMES
                        Working the steps, c’mon.

                                 MARK
                        It’s, like, really diggin into my 
                        wrists.

                                 JAMES
                        Step One.

           A heavy sigh, then.

                                 MARK
                             (reading)
                        “We admitted we were powerless over 
                        alcohol.”

           A silence.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Step Two?

           Mark looks up:  James is fixated on the TV.

           A female Sportscaster shoves a microphone at a shirtless 
           QUARTERBACK.  Beneath the Sportscaster, the graphic reads:  

           “HOLLY FITZGERALD”

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Wait. 

                                 JAMES
                        Yep.

                                 MARK
                        No.  Is that ... ?
                                 JAMES
                        The punch line.

                                 MARK
                        Whoa.  

           James nods.

                                 JAMES
                        It never goes away, my man.

                                 MARK
                        That sucks.

           A montage of Holly interviewing celebrity ATHLETES:  a 
           baseball player, a boxer, a jockey, landing on a black-n-
           white mug shot.  James turns the volume up:

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        --a misdemeanor, but her second DUI 
                        is considered a felony due to the 
                        extensive property damage done to 
                        the Burger King drive-thru.  Ms. 
                        Fitzgerald is now facing a possible 
                        year in jail ...

           James just stares at the TV, not moving.

                                 JAMES
                             (under his breath)
                        ... you need help ...

                                 MARK
                        She hasn’t changed much, huh.

           James’ eyes flicker with the blue light of the monitor ...

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        James.

           Hypnotized.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I have to piss.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE NEXT DAY

           James and Mark sit in a parked Chevy Cavalier, staring at the 
           Fitzgerald mansion (looking the same since we last saw it).
           Mark is cuffed to the door handle.

                                 JAMES
                        We’re gonna behave, right?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah.

           James reaches over and unlocks the handcuffs, handing Mark a 
           PAMPHLET.

                                 JAMES
                        First assignment.  Stick this--
                             (points to the mansion)
                        Into the front door there.

                                 MARK
                        Why?

           He’s PUSHED out the door-- 

           Then, James grabs his arm.

                                 JAMES
                        Look at me.
                             (serious)
                        Don’t get stupid.

                                 MARK
                        I get it, no funny business, fine.

           Mark gets out of the car.

           And he lopes across the vast front lawn, sighing, taking in 
           the general peace and tranquility of suburban Edina, 
           Minneapolis:  a Jag in the driveway, the lawn jockey in the 
           garden, the bright tulips ...

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Cake eaters.

           He steps onto the porch.  Quietly opens the screen door--

           THE FRONT DOOR OPENS

           And a woman stands there, CLAIRE FITZGERALD (60’s), tall, 
           patrician and surprised.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Can I help you?

                                 MARK
                        Uh. 
           He sticks the pamphlet into her hand.

           And abruptly turns away, walking fast to the already moving 
           car.

                                 JAMES
                        Get in, get in, get in.

           And he gets in, the Cavalier tearing down the street.

                                 JAMES (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Good work.

           INT. OFFICE - STRIP MALL - MORNING

           “The National Counselling Intervention Specialist”  

           A staff of four.  All recovering addicts.  

           “The James Gang.”

           There’s BOBBY, (40’s), ex-convict, steely, one year sober, 
           SPANKS (30’s), always smiling and always thirty days sober, 
           and DEE (20’s), skateboarder, covered in tattoos, just barely 
           thirty days sober.

           James opens the door, pushing Mark with his briefcase (Napa 
           leather)--

           James STOPS.

                                 JAMES
                        Seriously?

           Everyone freezes.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You’re seriously wearing shorts in 
                        my office.

           And Dee stands, a manila folder in his hand.  He’s wearing 
           “jams.”

                                 DEE
                        I thought--

                                 JAMES
                        You thought I wasn’t coming in 
                        today?

                                 DEE
                        Right.
                                 JAMES
                        This is Mark, everyone.

           Hello, Hi Mark.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        And I had hoped to show Mark how 
                        professional and serious-minded we 
                        all are here, but since Dee didn’t 
                        think I was coming in today, I 
                        guess it’s OK to sit around in 
                        SHORTS and jerk off.

                                 DEE
                        I’m sorry--

                                 JAMES
                        No, it’s cool, let’s all get a 
                        little more comfortable.

           He starts to unbuckle his belt--

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Give our balls some air.

           His pants hit the ground.

           The PHONE RINGS.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t answer that.

           It rings.  And rings and rings and rings.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead, pick it up, Spanks.

           Spanks, sitting at a desk, slowly picks up the phone.

                                 SPANKS
                             (quiet)
                        National Counselling Intervention 
                        Specialist, how may I help you?

           James stands there, defiant, his pants around his ankles.  

                                 DEE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JAMES
                        Lose my number.
                                 DEE
                        C’mon, James--

                                 JAMES
                        I’M SAVING LIVES, GODDAMNIT, AND 
                        YOU’RE WEARING SHORTS!

           Quiet. 

                                 DEE
                        I got someone on the hook, just now-

                                 JAMES
                        Get outta here.

           James rips the manila file from Dee and shoves it into Mark’s 
           hand.

                                 DEE
                        It’s big, just came in, look at the 
                        folder--

                                 SPANKS
                             (waves excitedly)
                        Gotta live one here.

           James quickly pulls up his pants.

                                 JAMES
                        Watch and learn.

           INT. JAMES’ CORNER OFFICE - MORNING

           Certificates and family photos, all framed, line the walls 
           and hang above tropical aquariums.  Lots and lots of 
           aquariums.

           James reaches for his desk phone, pointing to the phone on a 
           coffee table.

                                 JAMES
                        Use that phone there.

           Mark sits on the couch, reaching for it--

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Hold up.  
                             (serious)
                        Addicts are easy, families are 
                        hard.  Say it.  
                                 MARK
                        Addicts are easy, families are 
                        hard.

                                 JAMES
                        Remember it.  You ready?  

                                 MARK
                        What am I doin?

                                 JAMES
                        You’re on the firing line now, kid. 
                        One. Two. THREE--

           They both pick up the phone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A YOUNG LADY 

           Sitting on the floor.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        A call comes in, like this young 
                        lady ... 

           Her back is against the bed, clutching a phone, whispering:

                                 YOUNG LADY
                        My husband ... he drinks.

                                 JAMES  (V.O.)
                        She doesn’t really know why she’s 
                        calling.  She’s looking for any 
                        excuse to hang up and as much as 
                        she wants her situation to change, 
                        she’d rather keep things the same.  
                        It’s easier.  Safer.  

           There’s a BANG at the door.  She jumps, frantically reaching 
           for her purse.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        So we got this window, a very small 
                        one, to get her to agree to an 
                        intervention ...

           CLOSE-UP:  A hand searches the purse, pulling out a VISA 
           card.

                                                                CUT TO:
           A PHONE

           Slamming down.

                                 JAMES
                        And that’s how they do it downtown, 
                        baby. 

           INT. TRACT HOME - SEWARD - AFTERNOON

           A door opens.

           James and Mark stand on the front porch, smiling.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        Pre-intervention.  Lemmee break it 
                        down ...

           A CRAMPED LIVING ROOM

           The entire family is stuffed onto a couch:  GRANDMA, MOM, 
           STEP-DAD, the BEST FRIEND and the Young Lady (LAURA), all 
           stoic, all hard nuts to crack.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        For twenty minutes or so, I beat em 
                        up a little, give them a crash 
                        course in AA 101 ...

           James sits across from the family, on the edge of his seat, 
           wildly gesticulating--

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        And WHY do you enable Milo?  
                        Because you LOVE Milo, and the 
                        powerful stuff of secrets and 
                        silence will kill him, folks-- 
                        bottom line, it will KILL him--

           --spitting out the words, Mark dutifully taking notes at his 
           side.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Then I turn the tables round and 
                        let them talk ...

           GRANDMA

           James kneels beside her, holding her hand.
                                 GRANDMA
                        He’s my only grandson.  Curly hair.  
                        Girls just loved him ...
                             (breaks down)
                        I miss my little baby.

           James hugs her.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        By now, everyone’s crying.  So we 
                        break for an Intermission.

           INTERMISSION

           James and Mark huddle on the back porch, eating home-baked 
           cookies.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Whattaya think?

                                 MARK
                        It’s a ...

                                 JAMES
                        It’s cool, right?  You’re having a 
                        good time.

                                 MARK
                        Not really.

                                 JAMES
                        If you wanna stay sober, Mark, you 
                        gotta be on the firing line.

           Beat.

           He points to Mark’s note pad.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’d jot that down.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - TRACT HOME - NIGHT

           Everyone is standing.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        Now I’m Steven fuckin Spielberg ...

           James pulls the Best Friend to the couch.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna sit here.  And you--
           Points to the Step-Dad.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You’ll sit right here, next in 
                        line.

           SHEETS OF PAPER

           Are passed from hand to hand.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        Then I prepare their scripts ...

           James stands in front of the family, lecturing them:

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Letter One.  Show Milo what he’s 
                        done.  Stick to the facts.  Go 
                        ahead, Laura, give it a go.

           Milo’s wife sits upright, giving it a go:

                                 LAURA
                        Milo.  You’re embarrassing.  Stop 
                        drinking.

           Silence.

                                 JAMES
                        OK.  That was nice.  Now, let’s try 
                        starting every sentence with “I” 
                        instead of “You.”

                                 LAURA
                        Milo.  I’m embarrassed.  Stop 
                        drinking.

                                 JAMES
                        OK, sure.  Letter Two.  Tell Milo 
                        how his addiction has affected you.

           Milo’s Best Friend.

                                 BEST FRIEND
                        I took you to that Anthony Robbins 
                        thing and you just kept making fun 
                        of it and talking loud and I dunno.  
                        You vomited.  In your lap.  Right 
                        in the middle of the seminar.  
                             (beat)
                        I didn’t appreciate that.
           MILO’S MOTHER

           A petite little woman, cries.

                                 MILO’S MOM
                        And you’re screaming, “F your 
                        grilled cheese sandwiches, I hate 
                        your effin grilled cheese 
                        sandwiches, how about making me 
                        some effin waffles for a change, 
                        bitch.”

           MILO’S STEP-DAD

           Steely-eyed.

                                 STEP-DAD
                        I just want my car back.

           James claps his hands.

                                 JAMES
                        All right, let’s save some of this 
                        for tomorrow.  Final Letter.  
                        What’s your bottom line?

           Points down the row.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        GO.

                                 LAURA
                        I won’t let him stay at the house.

                                 JAMES
                        Good.  GO.

                                 GRANDMA
                        I won’t talk to him when he’s  
                        being crazy?

                                 JAMES
                        That’s right.  GO.

                                 MOM
                        I won’t pay his bills.

                                 JAMES
                        GO.
                                 BEST FRIEND
                        No more booze runs.

                                 JAMES
                        GO.

                                 STEP-DAD
                        I’ll call the cops next time.

                                 JAMES
                        Yes, you will, great, great.

           He stands.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        So.  Are there any final questions?

           A raised hand.

                                 STEP-DAD
                        This is a crock of shit.

           EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - MORNING

           James and Mark stride across a parking lot, the family 
           following in a tight group behind them.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        The Intervention is scheduled for 
                        the next morning, because things 
                        seem more possible in the morning.

           James stands outside the motel door.  He silently motions to 
           Milo’s wife and she joins him.  He KNOCKS on the door.

           Nothing.  

           He makes a rolling gesture at Laura, Go ahead.

                                 LAURA
                        Milo?  It’s Laura.  Everyone’s here 
                        and we just wanna talk ...

           She looks at James:

                                 JAMES
                             (mouths)
                        I love you.

                                 LAURA
                        I love you ... honey.
           A BANG against the door, everyone jumping back.

                                 MILO (O.S.)
                        I am NOT (unintelligible) if you 
                        fuckers (unintelligible) kill 
                        myself, I will--

           James points at Mark, C’mere, and Mark squeezes through.

                                 JAMES
                             (mouths)
                        One.

                                 MARK
                             (mouths)
                        What?!

                                 JAMES
                        Two.

                                 LAURA
                             (hissing)
                        What are you doin?

                                 JAMES
                        It’s OK.  I’m a doctor.

           KICKS IN THE DOOR 

           The door blown off the hinges ...

           A dim hell.  Furniture turned over, bottles everywhere.  A 
           lamp giving off a urine glow.  And MILO.  A squirrelly, tiny 
           bald dude.  Tighty-whiteys.

           He waves a whiskey bottle.

                                 MILO
                        I fucks you up, bitches.

           And he TOSSES THE BOTTLE-- 

           SHATTERING across Mark’s head.

           He’s down.  And Milo’s gone, a DOOR SLAMMING, locked in the 
           bathroom and James takes a running start, KICKING THE DOOR 
           DOWN, splintering it in two.

           He stops, standing there in the doorway:

           The window is open, a curtain blowing in the wind.

                                                                CUT TO:
           JAMES SPRINTING

           On the shoulder of a highway, Milo running ahead of him, 
           wearing nothing but his underwear, cars zipping by, honking.

                                 JAMES
                        IT’S NOT OK TO BE WHO YOU ARE!

           They keep running and running and running, 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        DRUNK OR SOBER, MILO, IT’S NOT OK 
                        TO BE WHO YOU ARE!

           And running and running, till finally, Milo just collapses at 
           the side of the road, coughing and retching, in the fetal 
           position.

           James falls to his knees beside him, breathing hard.  

           Milo lies there.  Sobbing.

                                                                CUT TO:

           JAMES

           Carrying the near-naked Milo in his arms, like a child, 
           plodding alongside the road, cars flying by in a constant 
           blur.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        The rest is easy.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           The family sit at their marks, reading from their letters.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        We offer him the Golden Ticket.

           Milo’s on the bed, wrapped in a blanket.

                                 LAURA
                        Will you accept this gift that we 
                        are giving you?

                                 MILO
                        Don’t leave me.
                                 LAURA
                        C’mon, that’s not fair--

                                 MILO
                        I’ll get better, OK, just no 
                        divorce.

           Mark blinks, staring wide-eyed at the familiar scene.

                                 LAURA
                        Will you accept this gift.  Please.

                                 MILO
                        ... ok ...

           Everyone bolts to their feet, erupting in tears and hugs.

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        We offer him an opportunity to get 
                        help, to save his life.

           James watches the family ... holding back his own tears.

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That’s my favorite part.

           Mark watches him. 

                                 JAMES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And that’s why I do this.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           James drives and Mark sits in the passenger seat (head 
           bandaged).  Milo’s slumped in the backseat, passed out. 

                                 JAMES
                             (into the phone)
                        Needle’s in the red zone, Potts, 
                        bullets, gimmee bullets--  A 
                        CELEBRITY?!  Really? 
                             (to Mark)
                        You got that client folder I gave 
                        you?

           Mark reaches for James’ briefcase (crocodile leather), 
           opening the manila folder.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t been in the office, how 
                        would I know, just tell me who it 
                        is ...
           Mark stares at the file.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Fine, I’ll check it out.  You’re 
                        one of the dozens, Potts, seeya at 
                        the OPH.

           Tosses the phone.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        What, who we got there?

           He rips the folder out of Mark’s hands.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Potts won’t tell me ...

           A sheet of form paper.

           CLIENT NAME:  Holly Fitzgerald

           The car slowly pulls over to the side of the road.  They sit 
           in silence, the car idle.

           Crickets.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Mark.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah?

                                 JAMES
                        How you doin, you good?

                                 MARK
                        Me?

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, you OK?

                                 MARK
                        I think so.

           Mark thinks, staring out the window.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        It’s weird.

           Looks back at Milo, drooling on himself.
                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        That was me ... like, twenty-eight 
                        days ago.

                                 JAMES
                        Twenty nine days.  Don’t sell  
                        yourself short.

           A big smile.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You’re kickin ass, man.

                                 MARK
                        I am?

                                 JAMES
                        You’re doin it.

                                 MARK
                        I am, right?  

                                 JAMES
                        You’re finding your way.

                                 MARK
                        James, I don’t wanna be like that--
                             (thumbs at Milo)
                        That’s not me.  I gotta be better 
                        than that if I want my life back, 
                        you know.

                                 JAMES
                        Now you’re talkin--

                                 MARK
                        Tell me what to do, man, you’re my 
                        sponsor, I’m all in, what’s next.

                                 JAMES
                        Listen.

           He listens.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going anywhere.  I’m here.     
                        Follow my lead, do as I say, you’ll 
                        get well.

           Mark takes that in.

                                 MARK
                        What about ...
           Points to the file.

                                 JAMES
                             (laughs)
                        Oh, fuck.  

           James stares at the folder, nodding mechanically.  

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Our first celebrity client, huh? 

           A frozen smile. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        We’ve hit the big time.

           INT. ORIGINAL PANCAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The entire “James Gang” is there.  Coffee and pie.  

           James holds court.

                                 JAMES
                        We just snatched ourselves a big 
                        payday, gentlemen.  Give it up for 
                        Dee.

           Dee is back, Applause, he smiles sheepishly.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        It’s funny.  I was just talkin 
                        about this the other day with 
                        Chief, remember?

           Chief nods knowingly.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Our first celebrity client.  

           James leans back luxuriously.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        This is monumental.  HUGE.  You 
                        know what this means--

                                 DEE
                        Geraldo.  

                                 JAMES
                        Geraldo, Sally Jessy, Maury, all of 
                        em, let the whole world know what 
                        we’re doin out here, right guys?
           They all smile.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Get that celebrity into treatment, 
                        keep that celebrity sober, make the 
                        rich client happy, and BAM, next 
                        thing you know it’s long, black 
                        cars and cigars.

           Yeah.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Spanks.

                                 SPANKS
                        Yessir.

                                 JAMES
                        I need you to set things up with 
                        Betty Ford.

                                 SPANKS
                        Got it.

                                 JAMES
                        Potts.  Arrange some First Class 
                        transportation.  No more Last Class 
                        for us, get us three tickets:  
                        myself, our celebrity and Mark, 
                        here.

           Mark raises an eyebrow.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Mark killed it today, guys.

           Nice work, light applause.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Bobby.

           Bobby perks up.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        We need to borrow your Beemer.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Done.

                                 JAMES
                        Need it tomorrow.  
                                 BOBBY
                        No problem.  Lemmee ask my wife, 
                        but, yeah, it should be cool.

                                 JAMES
                        Bobby, c’mon.

                                 BOBBY
                        I’ll rent one.

           Points to Chief and Dee.

                                 JAMES
                        Chief, Dee, you guys’ll be our 
                        floaters--  get Milo’s clothes to 
                        Hazelden, be on call, hold down the 
                        fort.

                                 DEE
                        Copy that.

                                 JAMES
                        Allison.

           Points to the waitress, walking by.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna take my credit card 
                        here and pay for the entire meal.

                                 ALLISON
                        Yessir.

           Thanks from the Gang.

           Then.

                                 SPANKS
                        I could take this one, James.

                                 JAMES
                        What- whattayou mean.

                                 SPANKS
                        Well, with it being Holly 
                        Fitzgerald and all, I thought maybe 
                        you’d ...

           It gets quiet.

                                 JAMES
                        What.
                                 SPANKS
                        Well, you know.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m sorry, I’m not following.

                                 SPANKS
                             (delicately)
                        The guys and I ... we’ve been 
                        talking, and it just seems a bit 
                        much, you know, with your history 
                        with her, and hell, I’ve been 
                        wanting to give it a shot, do an 
                        intervention myself, so ...

           Silence.

                                 JAMES
                        You guys have been talking, huh.

           Slight nods, everyone staring at their coffees.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You got any other suggestions.

           Nothing.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Potts?

           A shrug.  

                                 POTTS
                        ... probably a good idea.  Big 
                        client, don’t wanna--

                                 JAMES
                        What, fuck it up?

                                 POTTS
                        Well.

           Goes to say something--

           Doesn’t.

           A muffled RING breaks the silence--  

           James reaches into his briefcase, pulling out the phone.
                                 JAMES
                        Dr. James Fearing.
                             (deflates)
                        I’m picking us up some food, baby, 
                        you want that carrot cake?
                             (mouths to Mark)
                        Get in the car.

           Marks stands, mouthing Bye to the guys and leaves.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        Whoa, no.  No, no, not tomorrow, I 
                        can’t do that tomorrow, Colleen.

           He stands.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (covers the mouthpiece)
                        You’re fired.  All of you.

           Blank stares.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Pack up your shit and be out by 
                        tomorrow.

                                 POTTS
                        Now, wait a sec--

           But James is already gone.

           And the Gang just sits there in silence, staring at each 
           other.

                                 BOBBY
                        Toldja.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DOOR BURSTING OPEN

           James charges into the foyer.

                                 JAMES
                        COLLEEN?!

           Mark slinks in after him.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        COLLEEN?!
                                 COLLEEN (O.S.)
                             (hissing)
                        Shhhhh-- the kids.  

           Colleen appears at the top of the stairs, wearing a bathrobe.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m on the cusp of something big, 
                        Colleen, I can’t do tomorrow, we 
                        got a HUGE celebrity client on the 
                        hook here, HUGE, and I can’t--

                                 COLLEEN
                        Who?

                                 JAMES
                        --just drop everything for your 
                        goddamn parents, don’t we, Mark?  
                        Don’t we have a huge celebrity--

                                 MARK
                        Yes.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Who?

                                 MARK
                        Holly Fitzgerald.

                                 JAMES
                        Well, no, not her, exactly--

           Colleen just stares at him.  Mark’s face falls, realizing.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Not that Holly Fitzgerald.  The 
                        other one, you know, the ... 

           Beat.

                                 MARK
                        ... figure skater.

                                 JAMES
                        Right.

                                 COLLEEN
                             (near tears)
                        You’re an asshole.

           She turns on a heel.
                                 JAMES
                        This is my moment, Colleen, I can’t 
                        pass this up, not because I knew 
                        her, like, a hundred years ago--

           A door slam.  

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Shit.   

                                 MARK
                        I’m sorry.  

                                 JAMES
                        It’s fine.  

                                 MARK
                        I wasn’t thinkin, I--

                                 JAMES
                        It’s fine, whatever, she doesn’t 
                        understand. 

           Shakes his head. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        She never understands.   

           A muffled RING.  James pulls the phone out of his briefcase:

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        What.

           A slow smile. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Bobby got the Beemer.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE BEEMER

           Slowly pulling in front of the palatial Fitzgerald estate.

           Bobby drives, the chauffeur, while James and Mark lounge in 
           the backseat wearing dark suits, ties and sunglasses.

                                 JAMES
                        Stop right here.

           He takes a deep breath.  Stares at the mansion.
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Bobby.  Stay here with the car.

                                 BOBBY
                        Gotcha.

           Takes off his sunglasses.

                                 JAMES
                        Mark.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah?

                                 JAMES
                        You’re going to lead the pre-
                        intervention meeting today.

                                 MARK
                        Wha-- No.  

                                 JAMES
                        You got your notes, right?

                                 MARK
                        No, no way--  Why?

                                 JAMES
                        Well.  There’s a slim possibility 
                        that Holly’s Dad could ... maybe, 
                        recognize me.

                                 MARK
                        So?

                                 JAMES
                        So we didn’t get along and I’m not 
                        gonna squander this opportunity 
                        because of some whatever 18 years 
                        ago.

                                 MARK
                        I’m not doin it.

                                 JAMES
                        You’ll be fine.  

                                 MARK
                        James, c’mon.

                                 JAMES
                        I’ll be your wing man.
                                 MARK
                        I’ll blow it.

                                 JAMES
                        I’ll be right next to you.

                                 MARK
                        I’m a fuck-up, you know that.

                                 JAMES
                        Look at me.

           He does.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You can do this.

           Mark nods.

                                 MARK
                        OK.

                                 JAMES
                        If you wanna stay sober--

           James slips on his disguise:  a pair of Coke-bottle glasses, 
           his eyes huge and blinking.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You gotta be on the firing line.

           Mark stares at him.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Let’s do this.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - THE FITZGERALD MANOR - DAY

           Old money.  Edina money.  A quiet, serious room.  

           Mark and James sit stiffly on an antique couch, Claire 
           Fitzgerald sitting cross from them.

                                 CLAIRE
                        My husband will join us in a 
                        moment.  But, I should forewarn 
                        you... he doesn’t really believe in 
                        all this.
                             (a weak laugh)
                        He’s indulging me.
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I’m sure my wife has already told 
                        you-- 

           BORIS FITZGERALD strides into the room, walking and talking, 
           his mustache a shocking white--

                                 BORIS
                        I think this intervention business 
                        is a waste of all of our time and 
                        certainly my money.

           Sticks a hand out.

                                 BORIS (CONT’D)
                        Boris.

           Mark and James stand up, Mark firmly shaking Boris’ hand.

                                 MARK
                        Nice to meet you.  I’m Dr. Warren--  
                        Beatty.

                                 BORIS
                        Pleasure.

                                 MARK
                        And this is my, uh, associate--
                             (gestures to James)
                        Steve ... Stimple- stein.

                                 BORIS
                        Steve Stimplestein, OK.

           They shake, James not meeting Boris’ eyes.

                                 BORIS (CONT’D)
                        Have a seat.  

           They take a seat.

                                 BORIS (CONT’D)
                        Let’s not beat around the bush.  My 
                        daughter is a gutter drunk.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Boris, please--
                                 BORIS
                        She’s been like this for as far as 
                        I can remember and frankly, if it 
                        were up to me, I’d hire some guys 
                        to throw a sack over her and dry 
                        the brat out.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Boris.

                                 BORIS
                        Don’t “Boris” me now, we’ve tried 
                        every goddamn thing with her and 
                        I’m done.  

           He leans back, hands behind his head.

                                 BORIS (CONT’D)
                        So.  Gimmee the hard sell.

           James leans forward, STOPS, and reluctantly sits back, 
           pushing Mark forward.

                                 MARK
                        Well, sir ...  

           He coughs.  Checks his notes, flipping through his note pad.  
           Flips and flips.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Ah.  Addicts are easy, families are 
                        hard.

           Silence.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        So, there’s that ... to think 
                        about.

           Checks his notes again.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Oh.  Also.  It’s very important to 
                        understand that your daughter 
                        drinks because you enable her.

           Beat.

                                 BORIS
                        You’re telling me it’s my fault.
                                 MARK
                        Uh.  
                             (checks his notes again)
                        Yes. 

                                 BORIS
                        Get outta here.

           Boris STANDS and James meets him toe-to-toe.

                                 JAMES
                        Are you prepared to get real tough.

                                 BORIS
                        --the hell you think I’ve been 
                        doing--

                                 JAMES
                        Where does your daughter live.  An 
                        apartment?

                                 BORIS
                        Uptown.

                                 JAMES
                        You paying for it?

                                 BORIS
                        Well, yeah.

                                 JAMES
                        You help her out financially, 
                        right, pay her bills, bail her out, 
                        that kind of thing.

                                 BORIS
                        Of course, she’s my daughter.

                                 JAMES
                        Like I said.  Are you prepared to 
                        get tough?

           Boris blinks.  And sits down.  

           James follows.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Your daughter has a disease.

                                 CLAIRE
                        See, I told you.
                                 JAMES
                        And part of what’s so frustrating 
                        about this disease is that it tells 
                        the person suffering from it, that 
                        they don’t even have it.

           Boris is listening.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        We need to corner this disease, 
                        force a crisis and make your 
                        daughter live with the 
                        consequences.

                                 BORIS
                        How do we do that?

                                 JAMES
                             (simply)
                        Love.

           Mark watches, awestruck.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me.  How has your 
                        daughter’s behavior affected you?

                                 BORIS
                        Well.  She was arrested again--

                                 JAMES
                        No.  You.  How does she make you 
                        feel?

           A long silence.

                                 BORIS
                        I’m mad.  

                                 JAMES
                        Of course.

                                 BORIS
                        I’m real mad.

                                 JAMES
                        Tell me.

                                 BORIS
                        I did everything right.  Gave my 
                        kids what they needed.  What they 
                        wanted.  That’s what a good father 
                        does.  You provide.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        And after all the bailing out, 
                        picking up the pieces, all that, if 
                        she had just once said--
                             (eyes well up)
                        Thank You, Dad.
                             (breaks down)
                        I don’t even know her anymore.  
                        She’s this ... curse ... that I 
                        live with every day.
                             (beat)
                        I hate her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Honey.

                                 BORIS
                        I hate her so much.
                             (pleading)
                        What did I do wrong?

           James leans in, a hand on his arm.

                                 JAMES
                        You did nothing wrong.  

           Claire is crying now too, holding her husband and the three 
           of them hug each other in a tight circle.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I always envied Holly and how 
                        involved you were in her life.

           Mark raises an eyebrow.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        See, there’s something’s inside of 
                        me, something nagging, this itch 
                        that I can’t seem to ...

           He slowly pulls away.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t right ...

           He whips off his Coke-bottle glasses.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        My name is Dr. James Fearing.

           Boris narrows his eyes.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        “Jimmy.”  
                             (tears come)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        And I’d like to make amends for all 
                        the harm that I did to you and your 
                        family.

           Beat.

                                 BORIS
                        You.

           A hand CLUTCHES James’ neck.

                                 CLAIRE
                        BORIS!

           They tumble to the floor.

                                 JAMES
                             (choking)
                        I’m sorry--

                                 BORIS
                        It was YOU.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m sorry I harmed you--

                                 BORIS
                        YOU screwed her up--

                                 JAMES
                        And I forgive you.

                                 BORIS
                        You forgive ME.

           He BANGS James’ head against the floor, over and over again, 
           Mark and Mrs. Fitzgerald trying to pull Boris off and he LETS 
           GO, finally, James rolling to his side, red-faced and 
           coughing.

                                 BORIS (CONT’D)
                        Get him outta here.

           James sits up, rubbing his neck.

                                 JAMES
                        Sir.

                                 BORIS
                        Don’t you say another word.

                                 JAMES
                        Please.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Let him talk, Boris.

           Hard breathing.

                                 JAMES
                        She can be saved.

           A silence.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I can save her.

                                 BORIS
                        How do I know that.

                                 MARK
                        He saved me.

           Everyone looks up, suddenly remembering the other person in 
           the room.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        He can do it.

           James smiles.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I know.  

           They just stare at Mark.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Because of him ... I’m alive today.

           And that settles it.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MORNING

           James has an ear pressed against an apartment door.

                                 BORIS
                        Honey.  It’s your Father.  

                                 JAMES
                             (mouths)
                        I love you.

                                 BORIS
                             (tight)
                        I love you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        Your Mother and I are here and uh, 
                        ... we’d like to talk to you.

           Nothing.

                                 CLAIRE
                        C’mon, honey, open up.

           James wordlessly nods and Boris turns the apartment KEY into 
           the lock.

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - ST. PAUL - MORNING

           The door opens ...

           A lavish loft-like apartment, all windows and sparse modern 
           furniture.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Holly?!  Holly, it’s your Mother.

           BANG

           An empty vodka bottle skitters across the floor.  

           And CRUNCH, Mark steps in dry cat food, scattered about the 
           floor.  James stands at the dining room table, flipping 
           through a pile of unopened mail.

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t think she’s been here for 
                        awhile.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I just talked to her yesterday.  
                        Maybe she went out for coffee or 
                        something.

           Nobody believes that.

                                 JAMES
                             (suddenly, to Boris)
                        The credit cards she uses-- they’re 
                        in your name, right?

           Boris nods.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Let’s call them up and check the 
                        last place she spent money.

           James hands Boris his phone.
           Mark stands in front of the refrigerator, squinting at a 
           collage of PARTY PHOTOS pinned to the door:  there’s Holly 
           looking pouty on a cruise, sticking her tongue out on Bourbon 
           Street and in every single snapshot, there’s a martini glass 
           in one hand and an arm around a different BIG, HANDSOME GUY.

                                 BORIS
                             (into the phone)
                        Boris Fitzgerald.

           James strolls about the apartment, hands behind his back, 
           observing the apartment with a professional distance:  
           there’s a cluster of empty bottles hidden behind a couch, 
           clothes slung over a chair and then ...

           He stops.

           Sitting starkly on a side table, is a LIPSTICK TUBE.  

           He looks around (no one is looking) and slowly reaches for 
           the table, turning his back to everyone.  

           He snatches the lipstick.  Uncaps it.  And achingly pushes 
           the blood red tube, ever so slowly, up to his face ...

                                 BORIS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        She’s in Chicago.

           James pockets the lipstick.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Chicago?  What’s she doing in 
                        Chicago?

                                 BORIS
                        Ordered room service last night at 
                        the Drake.  

                                 JAMES
                        Here we go.

                                 BORIS
                        I dunno.

                                 JAMES
                        Sir.

                                 BORIS
                        This just seems impossible.
                                 JAMES
                        You need to show her who’s boss,  
                        show her how serious you really 
                        are.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think we should go.

                                 JAMES
                        I think your wife is right.

           Boris rubs his chin, then.

                                 BORIS
                        Chicago, huh.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DOOR BURSTING OPEN

           James charges into his house, carrying a MINK COAT.

                                 JAMES
                        Colleen?!

           Mark slinks in after him.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        One intervention, baby.  

           He searches the Rec Room ... nothing.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I paid for this with one 
                        intervention, what did I tell you?

           THE KITCHEN

           James rushes to the kitchen table and finds a NOTE.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (reads)
                        Damnit.

           Mark quietly enters behind him.

                                 MARK
                        Everything OK?

                                 JAMES
                        She’s staying with her folks for 
                        awhile-- ah fuck.
           Dumps the mink on the table.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        She doesn’t get it.

           A heavy sigh.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        She just doesn’t get it.

           THE DOOR BELL RINGS

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE FRONT DOOR   

           Swinging open and a CHAUFFEUR (50’s) stands there, wearing 
           all black, all formal.

                                 CHAUFFEUR
                        Dr. Fearing?

                                 JAMES
                        ... yeah ...?

                                 CHAUFFEUR
                        Your car is here.

           OVER THE CHAUFFEUR’S SHOULDER:  a long black limousine 
           stretches down the suburban street.

           INT. LIMOUSINE - MOVING - DAY

           James and Mark sit in the backseat, legs spread out, giddy as 
           teenagers. 

                                 JAMES
                        Check it out.

           He reaches into his briefcase (a deep burgundy) and pulls out 
           TWO HAVANA CIGARS with a wide smile:

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Huh?  Huh?

           Starts to light one--

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Oh, hey-- 
                             (leans forward)
                        Can we smoke these in here?
                                 CHAUFFEUR
                             (over his shoulder)
                        Be my guest.

           He lights and puffs, lights and puffs both cigars and they 
           lean back, the backseat filling with smoke.

                                 JAMES
                        You’re something else, man.

                                 MARK
                        What?

                                 JAMES
                        “He saved me.”  Classic.  

           Mark sheepishly smiles.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You got it.  You got the killer 
                        instinct.  You could be really good 
                        at this.

                                 MARK
                        You think?

                                 JAMES
                        Hell, yeah.

           Takes a long drag ...

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You and me?  

           Blows smoke rings.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        We’re going places.

           INT. AIRPLANE - MOVING - NIGHT

           First class.

           Boris, Claire and Mark are all wrapped in blankets, sleeping, 
           the entire cabin dark except one overhead light.  It shines 
           directly above James.

                                 JAMES
                             (waves to an attendant)
                        Kristy, honey?  Could I get another 
                        one of these Shirley Temples.
           CLOSE-UP:  a catalog.  Another luxury leather briefcase.

           He circles it.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Mark.
                             (nudges him)
                        Mark, look--

           Mark wakes up, barely, and they stare out the window 
           together, two beaming faces pressed against the glass:

           CHICAGO

           A twinkling phosphorescent grid.  A Saturday night on Saturn.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MICHIGAN AVE

           Water Tower, tree lights, carriages.

           It all rolls past the window, floating over James and Mark’s 
           faces, sitting in the backseat of another long, black limo, 
           the Fitzgeralds sitting across from them.

           EXT. THE DRAKE HOTEL - NIGHT

           James and Mark step out of the limo.

           Bright lights and uniformed men.

           They try hard not to look excited as the CONCIERGE pulls 
           their luggage from the trunk.  James and Mark go to grab them- 
           STOPPING.  

           Then, playing it super-cool.

           And with hands deep in their pockets, they swagger to the 
           entrance and through the revolving doors.

           INT. THE DRAKE HOTEL - NIGHT

           The lobby.  

           Like a Henry Mancini song.  Dark.  Sexy. 

           James and Mark just stand there, frozen, seized with class 
           anxiety.  They look at each other:  pleated khakis, Polo 
           shirts and dock shoes.
                                 MARK
                        We don’t belong here.

                                 JAMES
                        The hell we don’t.

           James strides to the front desk, stepping up beside Boris.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I got this.

           Slaps down a credit card.

                                 BORIS
                        Oh, no.  

                                 JAMES
                        Sir.  Please.

           The WOMAN behind the counter takes it.

                                 BORIS
                        You sure?

           Looks at him, C’mon.

                                 BORIS (CONT’D)
                        Well.  
                             (sincere)
                        Thank you.

                                 JAMES
                        My pleasure.

           The woman behind the counter looks up.

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m sorry, sir, but your card’s 
                        been declined.

                                 JAMES
                             (laughs)
                        Every time, with you people. 

           Hands her another card.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Try my Platinum.

                                 WOMAN
                        Yessir.

           James shrugs.
                                 JAMES
                        It does that sometimes.

           She tries the Platinum.

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m really sorry, sir, but this 
                        card was declined too.

                                 BORIS
                        I got it--

                                 JAMES
                             (holds up a hand)
                        Please.
                             (to Mark)
                        The business card.

           Mark stares at him, confused.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You know, the corporate card.

           Mark realizes, shaking his head slightly, No Way.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I gave it to you before the flight, 
                        remember?

           James narrows his eyes at him ... and Mark relents.

                                 MARK
                        Corporate card.  Right.

           Slaps down his own credit card.

                                 JAMES
                             (to Boris)
                        What room number is your daughter 
                        in?

                                 BORIS
                        Eight fifty-five.

                                 JAMES
                        Let’s get freshened up, gather our 
                        thoughts and meet at her room in an 
                        hour.

                                 BORIS
                        In an hour.  Fine.
                                 JAMES
                        I won’t let you down, sir.

           Boris allows a slight smile.

           And as the Fitzgeralds stroll arm-in-arm across the lobby, 
           the Woman behind the counter hands Mark a sheet of paper.

                                 WOMAN
                        Your bill, sir.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MARK    

           Face in his palms.

                                 MARK
                        Eleven-hundred dollars?

                                 JAMES
                        C’mon, get dressed.

                                 MARK
                        Who charges five hundred dollars a 
                        night, who does that?

                                 JAMES
                        We gotta go.

                                 MARK
                        This is too much, I’m done, find 
                        someone else.

                                 JAMES
                        I’ll pay you back, OK?

                                 MARK
                        You let ME pick up the tab?

                                 JAMES
                        Mark.  

                                 MARK
                        --I’m goin through a divorce, do 
                        you understand that?  I’m losing my 
                        house, my kid, yeah, let’s let that 
                        JERK blow eleven-hundred dollars.

                                 JAMES
                        Mark.  I’ll get you back when we’re 
                        done with this job, OK?  I swear.
                                 MARK
                        Ah, who am I kiddin--  

           Mark falls back on the bed.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I’m no interventionist.

                                 JAMES
                        That’s not true.

                                 MARK
                        I’m a fuck-up.  Drunk or sober.

                                 JAMES
                        That is not true.

           Mark just stares at the ceiling.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I need you.

                                 MARK
                        Sure.

                                 JAMES
                        I do, man, you’re one of the 
                        dozens.

           Then.

                                 MARK
                        I miss her.

                                 JAMES
                        I know.

                                 MARK
                        I miss my kid-- 

           He wipes his eyes.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

                                 JAMES
                        C’mere.

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Mark stands before a bathroom mirror, James shaking up a 
           cannister of SHAVING CREAM.
                                 JAMES
                        You believe in God?

                                 MARK
                        I dunno, man.

                                 JAMES
                        Do you think God has forgiven you?

                                 MARK
                        Sure.

           James sprays out the letter “N” in shaving cream.  Then the 
           letter “O” and so on, spelling out in big, foamy letters the 
           phrase:  “NOT GUILTY”

                                 JAMES
                        Who the hell are YOU to overrule 
                        God?

           Mark looks at himself in the mirror.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Believe it.

           And he leaves Mark to stare at his reflection, a tired, sad 
           reflection, the phrase “NOT GUILTY” emblazoned across his 
           forehead.

                                 JAMES (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I steamed your suit.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - THE DRAKE - NIGHT

           James and Mark stride down the hallway, looking like high 
           rollers, the Fitzgeralds close behind, everyone counting down 
           the room numbers.

           Room 855.

                                 JAMES
                             (quiet)
                        Here we are.  Everybody good?

           Silent nods and James KNOCKS on the door, everyone holding 
           their breath ... 

           A silence.

           And.

           Nothing.
                                 BORIS
                        Goddamnit.  This is a waste of  
                        time.

                                 JAMES
                        No need to panic.  We’re gonna 
                        plant ourselves at the end of the 
                        hallway there--  

           Points to TWO CHAIRS at the end of the hall, flanking a 
           coffee table.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Boris, Claire.  Why don’t you two 
                        go back to your room, get a solid 
                        night’s sleep and let us do our 
                        jobs.

           Boris and Claire just stand there, looking a little lost.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        We got it under control.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A COURTESY PHONE

           Sitting on a coffee table.

                                 JAMES
                        Call me on that, if you see Holly.

           James stands above Mark, sitting at the end of the hallway, 
           several doors down from Holly’s room.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Make sure she doesn’t go anywhere.

                                 MARK
                        Wait-- where you goin?

           Punches him in the arm.

                                 JAMES
                        Stay sharp.

           INT. LOBBY - THE DRAKE - NIGHT

           The late night crowd.  Dark suits and high heels.
           James stands in the middle of the lobby, briefcase at his 
           side (patent leather), an unlit cigar stuck in his teeth, and 
           watching a BUSINESSMAN shake hands with another BUSINESSMAN.  
           They both wear LANYARDS around their necks.  And they both 
           smoke cigars.

                                                                CUT TO:

           AN UNLIT CIGAR

           Poking between the two Businessmen.

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        Gotta light?

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Oh, yeah, sure.

           He pats himself down, looking for a lighter, finds it and 
           James leans into the flame, puffing and puffing, EYEING THE 
           NAME TAG around the man’s neck:  

           “National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association”  

           He leans back, satisfied.

                                 JAMES
                        Thank you, gentlemen.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        That a Cuban?

                                 JAMES
                        Is there any other kind?

           Laughter and back slaps.

           THE PALM COURT - CORNER BAR

           Packed with sportscaster and sportswriters, jackets off and 
           sleeves rolled up.  Cigarette smoke, quiet JAZZ.  

           And James stands at the entrance, scanning the crowd ...

           Nothing, no Holly.  

           Instead, a LANYARD.  Draped over a bar stool.

           He casually strolls over, smoking his cigar, dancing a bit to 
           the music, smiling at the BARTENDER, and--
           HE SNATCHES THE LANYARD

                                                                CUT TO:

           MARK

           Keeping watch, making spit bubbles.

           WOMAN’S LAUGHTER

           And a door bursts open, right in front of Mark, food trays 
           tumbling to the floor, Whoops, a middle-aged RED-HEAD pokes 
           her head out, drunk and half-naked.

                                 RED-HEAD
                        Oh.  Shhh.  Sorry.

           Mark gives her a half-smile and she disappears back inside, 
           Ohmigod, there’s someone out there, laughter, and the DOOR 
           SLAMS.

           He blinks.

           A half-glass of WHITE WINE sits in front of him.  Just 
           sitting there, all alone, in an empty hallway.  

           Mark bites his lip.

           And with his foot, he reaches for it, not leaving the chair, 
           his shoe snaking across the carpet, Mark hanging onto the 
           chair like a buoy, reaching and reaching for the glass, till 
           finally, with his tippy-toe, HE KNOCKS IT OVER, the wine 
           spilling and spreading across the carpet.

           He crawls back up the chair.  

           Pale, breathing hard.

           He closes his eyes.

           INT. LOBBY - THE DRAKE - NIGHT 

           James wears the lanyard around his neck, striding past a 
           YOUNG LADY sitting at a swag table--

                                 YOUNG LADY
                        Sir.

           James freezes.
                                 YOUNG LADY (CONT’D)
                        You’ll have to put out your cigar.

                                 JAMES
                        Ah.  Of course.

           Takes a few puffs--

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Did I miss dessert?

                                 YOUNG LADY
                             (smiles)
                        No, I don’t think so.

           He stubs the cigar out in an ashtray-- 

                                 JAMES
                        I like the sweater.

           And he saunters through the banquet doors.

           THE GRAND BALLROOM

           James enters the vast, dark room and MUSIC KICKS IN.  

           A haunting voice:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        “Come let’s stroll, stroll across 
                        the floor ...”

           The Stroll by The Diamonds.  A burlesque beat echoing 
           throughout the near-empty ballroom.  A banner hangs over a 
           makeshift stage:  “ROCKIN BACK IN TIME!”  And a ‘50s cover 
           band rocks and rolls, wearing white suits and pomade hair.

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        “Feel so good, take me by my hand.”

           And on the small dance floor, two rows of BABY BOOMERS do the 
           Stroll, clapping together, completely wasted, ties wrapped 
           around their foreheads, heels off, COUPLES moving down the 
           Avenue together, bumping and grinding, everyone very 
           committed to Strolling.

           James scans the hall:  knots of PEOPLE talk at numbered 
           tables, sitting in shadow.

           He moves closer to the dance floor ...
                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        “There’s my love, strolling in the 
                        door ...”

           HE STOPS. 

           Holly Fitzgerald. 

           Slowly moving down the Avenue ...

           Eyes locked on James.  As if she’s been waiting for him all 
           along.  

           A martini in her hand, a red cocktail dress, seriously 
           Strolling towards James, all on her own, people moving down 
           the line, clapping and dancing mechanically around her.

           He’s frozen.

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        “Baby, let’s go strolling, by the 
                        candy store ...”

           She steps off the dance floor, mascara smeared, still 
           dancing, approaching slowly, her half-mast eyes never leaving 
           his, until finally, she’s toe-to-toe with him. 

           The music stops.  

           APPLAUSE.

           Hard breathing between them.  The dance floor empties, lights 
           dim and a disco ball spins.

           Then.

           Smoke Gets in Your Eyes by The Platters.

           They stare at each other.  She touches his stomach.

                                 HOLLY
                        Lil belly.

           Looks him over, a small smile.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Lil grey hairs ...

           Moves in close, smelling his neck.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Jimmy.
                                 JAMES
                        You need help.

                                 HOLLY
                        I do.

           Nuzzles into his chest.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Help me.

           She sways to the music, not touching him.

                                 JAMES
                        Holly.  
                             (rote)
                        Your life has become unmanageable.

                                 HOLLY
                             (quietly sings)
                        “When your heart’s on fire--”

                                 JAMES
                        You’re powerless over alcohol.

                                 HOLLY
                        “--you must be alive--”

                                 JAMES
                        Let go and let God.

                                 HOLLY
                        “Smoke gets in your eyes.”

                                 JAMES
                             (blunt)
                        Your father’s here.

           She suddenly pulls back.

                                 HOLLY
                        Where’d you go?

           Searches his face.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Where are you?  Where’s my Jimmy?

           He squarely looks at her.

                                 JAMES
                        Holly.  Please.
                                 HOLLY
                             (a slow smile)
                        There you are.

           She touches his face.  

                                 JAMES
                        Listen.

           Now he’s swaying to the music too.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Things have to change for you--

                                 HOLLY
                        Did you miss me?

                                 JAMES
                        --the way things changed for me.

                                 HOLLY
                        Tell me.

                                 JAMES
                        What?

                                 HOLLY
                        Tell me you missed me.

                                 JAMES
                        I remember you fondly, yes.

                                 HOLLY
                        I don’t believe you.

                                 JAMES
                        Holly. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Jimmy.

                                 JAMES
                        You need to get into treatment.

                                 HOLLY
                        Can I ask you something?

           She grabs his hand and places it on her chest.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Do you feel that?

           He closes his eyes.
                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Am I still pretty?

                                 JAMES
                        I’ve arranged everything at the 
                        Betty Ford Center.

                                 HOLLY
                        Tell me I’m pretty.

                                 JAMES
                             (quick)
                        You’re pretty.

                                 HOLLY
                        Do you really think so?

           She wraps her arms around him.

                                 JAMES
                        Please don’t do that.

                                 HOLLY
                        Let’s get outta here.

                                 JAMES
                        No.

                                 HOLLY
                        Jimmy.

                                 JAMES
                        I can’t.

                                 HOLLY
                        You can.

                                 JAMES
                        Please.  Go to treat--

           She kisses him, softly, cutting him off.

                                 HOLLY
                        I think ...

           Eyes flutter, her head lolling back.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Catch me.

           And he catches her, tight-- kissing her on the mouth.
           They pull apart, staring at each other.

                                 JAMES
                        Let’s go.

                                                                CUT TO:

           JAMES AND HOLLY

           Running through the lobby together, hand in hand, like 
           teenagers-- 

                                 JAMES
                             (laughing)
                        Wait, wait.  We can’t go back to 
                        your room.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE FRONT DESK

           The GENTLEMAN behind the counter shakes his head.

                                 GENTLEMAN
                        I’m sorry, but we’re all booked for 
                        the night.

           She slaps down her father’s credit card.

                                 HOLLY
                        Give me the best you got.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

           Blackness.

           The DOOR BURSTS open, two SILHOUETTES in the doorway and the 
           lights click on ... 

           The Presidential Foyer.  

           James stands there, mouth open, and Holly casually throws her 
           purse on a chair.

           She walks deeper into the suite, pulling off her clothes, 
           dropping one item at a time, leaving a trail for him to 
           follow, which he dutifully does, tossing his briefcase on an 
           ottoman.  

           THE PRESIDENTIAL LIVING ROOM
           Holly stands in front of a window, just a SHADOW, the city 
           skyline behind her, a continuous streak of red and white 
           lights zipping along Lake Shore Drive.

           James stands there and stares ...   

           The palatial suite.  

           The twinkling city.  

           Holly.

           Everything he’s ever wanted.

           He cries.

           Quietly.  Tears streaming down his face.

                                 HOLLY
                        C’mere.

           A voice in the dark.

           He goes to the voice, mechanically, and embraces the shadow. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got you.

           And as she pulls him into the Presidential Bedroom, slowly, 
           there’s a MUFFLED RING coming from James’ briefcase.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Mark sits where we left him, the courtesy phone to his ear.

                                 MARK
                        Pick up, pick up, pick up.

           Standing in front of Holly’s room is a BIG HANDSOME GUY 
           (30’s).  He BANGS on her door.

                                 HANDSOME
                        C’mon, Holly.
                             (kicks the door)
                        Let me in--

           Turns to Mark, sitting at the far end of the hall.

                                 HANDSOME (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

           Starts to walk over (Mark quietly hangs up the phone).
                                 HANDSOME (CONT’D)
                        You see anyone come out of that 
                        room?

                                 MARK
                             (a shrug)
                        I don’t think so, no.

                                 HANDSOME
                        Shit. 
                             (sighs)
                        Well, thanks.

           Mark closes his eyes, squeezing the bridge of his nose.

                                 MARK
                        Where the hell are you ...

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLACKNESS

           A KNOCK

           Eyes snap open.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           A MAID (50’s) stands outside of Holly’s door, a toiletry cart 
           parked alongside the wall.  

           THE NEXT DAY.  

           Mark rubs his eyes and sits upright, watching the Maid open 
           the door to Holly’s room.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What’s going on here?

           BORIS stands over him.

                                 MARK
                        Wha-- 

                                 BORIS
                        We’ve been trying to get a hold of 
                        you all morning.

                                 MARK
                        I’ve been-- I’m on watch.
                                 BORIS
                        Yeah, well, keep up the great work.

           Boris rushes down the hall, Claire and Mark trailing after 
           him and they all charge into Holly’s room.

           HOLLY’S ROOM

           Nobody’s there.  Just the Maid, standing in the middle of the 
           room with a pillow in her hand.

           Boris turns on Mark.

                                 BORIS (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Jimmy?

           He opens his mouth to answer ... 

           Closes it.

                                 BORIS (CONT’D)
                        You don’t know where he is, do you?

                                 MARK
                        He was following a lead, and, I--

                                 BORIS
                        Bunch of yahoos.

           Boris strides to the phone next to the bed and picks it up.

                                 BORIS (CONT’D)
                        Front desk.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE FITZGERALDS 

           Charging down the hallway again, Mark on their heels.  Boris 
           sticks a room key into the Presidential Suite’s door.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - MORNING

           It’s quiet.

           Boris and Claire rush through the Presidential Foyer, Mark 
           pausing at the ottoman ...

           James’ briefcase.  

           He closes his eyes, fearing the worst.
           THE PRESIDENTIAL BEDROOM

           The door swings open ...

           James sleeps upright in a king-sized bed, shirtless, Holly 
           draped across his chest.

           His eyes snap open.  

                                 JAMES
                        Hey.

           Boris and Claire stand in the doorway.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I found Holly.

                                 BORIS
                        SonuvaBITCH--

           He CHARGES for the bed, Holly suddenly awake.

                                 HOLLY
                        Daddy, no!

           James hits the floor, naked, pulling Holly with him, side-
           stepping Boris and slipping into--

           THE PRESIDENTIAL BATHROOM

           He locks the door, faces flushed, laughing, A BANG AT THE 
           DOOR, Goddamn you, Fearing!  Quickly getting dressed, James 
           and Holly run for another door, I’ll KILL YOU, slipping into 
           the--  

           PRESIDENTIAL FOYER

           Mark stands there, wide-eyed.

                                 JAMES
                        Grab my briefcase.

           He snatches it and the three of them sprint for the door.

           INT. LOBBY - THE DRAKE - MORNING

           James and Holly run across the lobby, barefoot, shirts 
           unbuttoned, Mark right behind them--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        HOLLY?!
           The BIG, HANDSOME GUY.

           He runs after them, his face falling when he sees James--

                                 HANDSOME
                        Who the hell--

                                 HOLLY
                        Oh, Hi.

           He PULLS at Holly’s arm and JAMES CLOCKS HIM, hard, the poor 
           guy sprawling backwards-- 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        That was my boyfriend.

           And they’re laughing and running again, tearing through the 
           revolving doors--

           EAST WALTON PLACE

           They run for the curb, James WHISTLING, a cab screeching in 
           their path, the three of them tumbling inside, never missing 
           a beat, the taxi pulling away and Holly’s Boyfriend runs 
           after them, HOLLY, PLEASE, HOLLY, waving his arms.

           INT. CAB - MOVING - MORNING

           James leans forward.

                                 JAMES
                        O’Hare airport.
                             (to Mark)
                        Mark, I’d like you to meet Holly.  
                        My fiance.

                                 MARK
                        Fiance. 

           She holds out a limp hand.

                                 HOLLY
                        Charmed.

           James is already dialing his phone.

                                 JAMES
                        I feel, I don’t know how I feel, 
                        man, it’s incredible.  There’s like 
                        lightning bolts comin out my 
                        fingertips, you know.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAMES (CONT'D)
                        I’m a God on a mountaintop, looking 
                        down at my future and it’s lookin 
                        good, man, REALLY GOOD--
                             (into phone)
                        Potts.  How you doin, you doin 
                        good?  Good, good, you’re one of 
                        the dozens, Potts, listen--

                                 HOLLY
                        I feel sick.

                                 JAMES
                        I need you to book those tickets 
                        outta Chicago now and I need it 
                        today, like, in an hour--

                                 HOLLY
                        Gimmee that.

                                 JAMES
                        What, no, not the--

           She VOMITS in his briefcase.

           INT. AIRPLANE - MOVING - DAY

           First class.

           Holly is unconscious on James’ shoulder.  Mark sits across 
           the aisle.

                                 JAMES
                             (fast)
                        I’ve been asleep all these years, 
                        you know, just asleep on my feet, 
                        walking and talking--
                             (robot voice)
                        Good Morning, Sir, Nice Weather 
                        We’re Having, Beep-Bop-Boop, it’s 
                        BULLSHIT, you know, asleep on my 
                        feet for years and for what, Mark, 
                        tell me, because none of it adds up-

           Mark patiently listens.

           INT. CAB - MOVING - NIGHT

           Holly is still unconscious on James’ shoulder.
                                 JAMES
                        And this itch, or whatever you want 
                        to call it, that’s been eating me 
                        from the inside all these years, I 
                        realized, isn’t something you can 
                        ignore, it isn’t something you can 
                        willfully push away, but rather 
                        something you have to embrace, 
                        Mark.  You have it hug it tight and 
                        never let it go, because it’s YOU.  
                        You gotta lick it, eat it, devour 
                        it--

           Mark nods, not understanding at all.

           EXT. BETTY FORD CENTER - CALIFORNIA - NIGHT

           James pushes Holly in a wheelchair down a long hallway.  Mark 
           follows.

                                 JAMES
                        And all this time I’ve been talking 
                        about Holly like there’s something 
                        wrong or sick about it, instead of 
                        what she really is ... 
                             (stops)
                        Me.  She is me.  I am her.  
                             (makes a fist)
                        We are one.  And that’s the truth 
                        here, with a capital T.  It isn’t 
                        about Right or Wrong or Addiction, 
                        all that nonsense that’s been 
                        clouding my head, like, forever, 
                        but Life and the freedom to live 
                        the way you were destined to.

           Patient intake.  An ELDERLY WOMAN behind a counter.  James 
           kneels in front of Holly.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (quiet)
                        Wake up, baby.  Time to go.

           She opens her eyes, barely, the light too bright.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, say Goodbye.

                                 HOLLY
                        I need a drink.
                                 JAMES
                        I know, baby.

           She rubs her eyes, sitting upright.

                                 HOLLY
                        Where are we?

                                 JAMES
                        You’re at the Betty Ford Center.

                                 HOLLY
                        Whoa-- what?

           She looks over his shoulder:  a long, cold hallway.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        No.  

                                 JAMES
                        Listen to me--

                                 HOLLY
                        I’m not doin it, I can’t do it.

                                 JAMES
                        Yes, you can.

                                 HOLLY
                        No, please.

                                 JAMES
                        Holly.  You can do it and you wanna 
                        know why?

           She stares at him.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Because you want to.

           She thinks about that.

                                 HOLLY
                        You wanna marry me, right?

                                 JAMES
                        Absolutely.

           Her eyes well with tears.

                                 HOLLY
                        After ... ? 
                                 JAMES
                        What, baby?

                                 HOLLY
                        After here, is life ... ?

                                 JAMES
                        Tell me.

                                 HOLLY
                        Fun?

                                 JAMES
                        Of course.

                                 HOLLY
                        You can love big, right?

                                 JAMES
                        Yes.

                                 HOLLY
                        You do, right?  You love big?

                                 JAMES
                        I do.

                                 HOLLY
                        Like your wife.  You loved her big 
                        once.

           He blinks.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Your kids too, right?

           He just stares ...

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never loved anyone like that.  
                        Except maybe you.  Jimmy?

           The Elderly Woman approaches.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        OK, Holly.  Let’s get you started.

                                 HOLLY
                        Jimmy?  

                                 JAMES
                        Yes.
                                 HOLLY
                        What if I’m dull?  I don’t wanna be 
                        dull, Jimmy.  I don’t want life to 
                        be dull, is it dull?

           James just stares at her as she’s wheeled down the long, 
           white hallway.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                             (calling to him)
                        Is life dull, Jimmy?  I wouldn’t be 
                        able to stand that, Jimmy, I 
                        wouldn’t--

           Mark stands behind him and they both watch her disappear 
           behind the swinging doors.

           A silence.

                                 MARK
                        You OK?

           INT. DENNY’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           James stares at a cup of coffee.

           Mark watches him.

           Easy Listening plays from somewhere.

                                 MARK
                        Hey.

           Nothing.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you OK, or--

                                 JAMES
                        You get it, right?  Me and Holly?

                                 MARK
                        Sure.

                                 JAMES
                        You do?  You do.  We’re like--

           Makes a fist.

           A muffled RING.  
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’m not here.

           He TOSSES the phone across the table and Mark fumbles with 
           it, answering:

                                 MARK
                        Uh, Dr. James Fearing-- his phone.  
                        Hello. 
                             (covers mouthpiece)
                        It’s Colleen.

           James shakes his head, No Way.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Hey, uh, he’s not here, could he 
                        call you back?  
                             (bites his lip)
                        Oh.  OK.  I’ll tell him, then.

           Hangs up.  

                                 JAMES
                        I’m not going back.

           Mark doesn’t say anything.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’m not.  I say we book ourselves a 
                        room round here, a Holiday Inn or 
                        something and just be, like, 
                        available, you know, till Holly 
                        gets through this-- in fact, let’s 
                        just move our operations out here.  
                             (a smile)
                        In Palm Springs.  Why not, right?  
                        Start a branch out here in 
                        California, lotsa celebrities, 
                        lotsa addicts and then, who knows, 
                        maybe New York, or--

                                 MARK
                        Colleen’s divorcing you.

           James blinks.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 JAMES
                        No.

           Shakes his head, eyes closed.
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        No, she’s not.

                                 MARK
                        She said--

                                 JAMES
                        No, she’s not.  This is what she 
                        does, see, she does this--

                                 MARK
                        She sent papers.  

                                 JAMES
                        She sent-- what?

                                 MARK
                        Divorce papers.  To the office.  

                                 JAMES
                        No, she didn’t.

                                 MARK
                        Potts has em.

                                 JAMES
                        Potts.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah.

           Silence.

           Then, a sharp LAUGH.

                                 JAMES
                        Fuck her.

           Waves a hand.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I love Holly.  Doesn’t matter.

           Sips his coffee.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Doesn’t matter.

                                 MARK
                        Maybe you should call her--
                                 JAMES
                             (suddenly)
                        Where the hell are my nachos?

           Waves to someone OFF SCREEN:

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        What do I gotta do, huh-- how hard 
                        is it to make chicken nachos? 

                                 MARK
                        Shhh.

                                 JAMES
                             (voice raising)
                        No, I gotta tip the guy, like, what- 
                        ten, fifteen percent and he’s gonna 
                        ignore me, like I’m some bum in the 
                        corner, with just a cup of coffee--

                                 MARK
                        Keep your voice down.

                                 JAMES
                        Dontcha think, though?

                                 MARK
                        What.

                                 JAMES
                        FUCK HER, right?  So much blah blah 
                        blah, you know.

           He doesn’t know.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Controlling, uptight, Betty Crocker-
                             (sudden)
                        Why, whattayou think?

                                 MARK
                        What.

                                 JAMES
                        You’re me.  What would you do?

                                 MARK
                        Well.

           He thinks.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I wish I had a second chance.
                                 JAMES
                        She’s had plenty of chances.

                                 MARK
                        No, I mean-- I dunno, man.
                             (beat)
                        I love my wife.

                                 JAMES
                        I love my wife.  

           Mark blinks.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        What, you don’t think I love my 
                        wife? 

                                 MARK
                        I--

                                 JAMES
                        She’s the mother of my children, 
                        Mark, of course I love my wife, 
                        that’s not the point.

                                 MARK
                        I’m confused.

                                 JAMES
                        You know what, forget it.  No one 
                        understands.  It’s so beyond the 
                        common, like, human understanding 
                        of things, that I don’t even know 
                        if I can talk about it in a way to 
                        make it more clear for you, just 
                        forget it, ok, just ...

           He trails off.

           They sit in silence.

           Easy Listening music again.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        “Wake up Maggie, I think I got 
                        something to say to you--”

           Maggie May.

           James looks up.  Stares dumbly at Mark.

                                                                CUT TO:
           JAMES AND MARK

           Falling into the backseat of a cab.

                                 MARK
                             (leans forward)
                        Airport.

                                 JAMES
                        Such a FUCKIN ASSHOLE, what the 
                        hell was I thinking, ohmigod, 
                        please, please, please, God, I 
                        fucked up bad, I fucked it up so 
                        bad this time--

           Mark patiently listens.

           INT. AIRPLANE - MOVING - NIGHT

           Economy class.

           James and Mark are squeezed together.

                                 JAMES
                             (fast)
                        So I’m pinned under my car, right, 
                        and here comes lil Colleen, 
                        screaming for help and nobody’s 
                        coming.  So she grabs the car, my 
                        lil Colleen, and she LIFTS the damn 
                        car off me, Mark, like a 
                        superwoman.  Now how can a lil 
                        woman like Colleen, my baby 
                        Colleen, lift a goddamn automobile 
                        off a dying man, I ask you?  Love, 
                        Mark.  Love.  She loves me like 
                        that.  

           Mark nods.

           INT. MINNEAPOLIS/ST. PAUL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MORNING

           James and Mark SPRINT though a crowded airport lobby, James 
           yelling into the phone:

                                 JAMES
                        Meet me at the house in twenty 
                        minutes, Potts, and bring those 
                        papers, you understand, bring the 
                        divorce papers--
           EXT. FEARING HOUSEHOLD - MORNING

           A cab comes to a screeching halt.

           James and Mark jump out, the James Gang standing on the front 
           lawn-- Bobby, Dee, Chief, all of them walking fast behind 
           James and Mark, keeping pace, and Potts, holding out the 
           divorce papers.

                                 POTTS
                        Here you go, Boss.

           James snatches the documents, looking them over.

                                 BOBBY
                        Everything OK?

                                 JAMES
                        Working on it.  Here.

           Tosses something to Mark.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Hang back, fellas.

           And the Gang falls back, keeping a respectful distance.  Mark 
           opens his hand:  

           Holly’s lipstick.

           INT. FEARING HOUSEHOLD - MORNING

           The door bursts open.

                                 JAMES
                        COLLEEN?!

           The kids run into the foyer, James scooping them up into his 
           arms.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        COLLEEN!

           And there she is.  

           Standing at the top of the stairs.  James kisses the kids.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        We’ll play later, OK, run along.

           They take off.  
           A long silence.

                                 COLLEEN
                        What.

           He raises the divorce papers.  RIPS THEM IN HALF.

                                 JAMES
                        I won’t do it.

           He moves to the stairs.

                                 COLLEEN
                        You stay right there.

                                 JAMES
                        Honey.

           Hands up.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Honey.  I’m wrong.

           She rolls her eyes.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Here we go.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m wrong.  And you can go ahead 
                        and divorce me but I won’t accept 
                        it, OK?  You’re going to have to 
                        understand that.  I won’t accept 
                        it.  

                                 COLLEEN
                        Really.

                                 JAMES
                        I’ll camp outside.  Right there on 
                        the front lawn, married to you 
                        forever, understand?  You can re-
                        marry someone else and I’ll still 
                        be out there, baby, wearing this 
                        ring.  

                                 COLLEEN
                        You talk and talk and talk--

                                 JAMES
                        Test me.  Go ahead, move to New 
                        York.  I’ll be living on the fire 
                        escape.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAMES (CONT'D)
                        Move to Alaska, I’ll be sleeping 
                        with the dogs, you can’t get rid a 
                        me.

                                 COLLEEN
                        I’m sick of you, Jim.  All the 
                        lying and cheating-- 

                                 JAMES
                        Me too.  I’m sick of me too, baby, 
                        lemmee tell you, I sicken myself.

                                 COLLEEN
                        It’s you and you and you and then 
                        it’s AA and your AA friends and 
                        then the kids and I’m, like,  
                        somewhere waaayyy down there.

                                 JAMES
                        That’s not true. 

                                 COLLEEN
                        You know it is, Jim.

                                 JAMES
                        You’re number one.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Get outta here.

           He takes a step on the bottom step.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Stop right there.

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t know what I’m sayin or 
                        doing, I’m just winging it 
                        everyday, trying to live right by 
                        you and the kids and I’m not, I 
                        know that, I am not.

           He takes another step.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Don’t take another step.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m coming, baby.  You can’t stop 
                        me.

                                 COLLEEN
                        I don’t want you anymore, I wanna 
                        divorce.
                                 JAMES
                        You don’t mean that.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Yes, I do.

                                 JAMES
                        You remember our deal?

                                 COLLEEN
                        Don’t.

                                 JAMES
                        What did we say.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Don’t take another goddamn step.

           He takes another step (halfway there).

                                 JAMES
                        You were goin to Hawaii, remember, 
                        a family vacation.

                                 COLLEEN
                        No.

                                 JAMES
                        And we made our deal.

           Takes another step.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        If we missed each other as much as 
                        we thought we would ...

           Her eyes well up.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        We’d get married.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Stop it.

                                 JAMES
                        I love you.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Stop it.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m sorry.
                                 COLLEEN
                        No, you’re not.  You don’t care 
                        about anything except you.

                                 JAMES
                        Listen to me.

           He takes another step, near the top now.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Mean it.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m sorry.

           He’s face-to-face with her.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  I love you.

           He picks her up, carrying her like a little girl.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Why do you hurt me.

                                 JAMES
                        I dunno, baby, I dunno.

           She buries her face in his chest.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’ll never let anything happen to 
                        you, Colleen.

                                 COLLEEN
                        No more.

                                 JAMES
                        No more.  You’re everything.

           And he carries her into the bedroom.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. FEARING HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           All’s quiet.

           The front door opens and Mark slips in.
           A muffled RING. 

           Coming from between the pillows of the couch.  The phone.  
           Mark answers it.

                                 MARK
                        Dr. James Fearing’s phone.

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                             (a whisper)
                        Hey.

                                 MARK
                        Hey, man.  

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        You just get in?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah.  Went and saw a movie.

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        Guess what?

                                 MARK
                        What.

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        I’m back in the Big Bed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           JAMES

           Sitting on the edge of the Big Bed, his back to a sleeping 
           Colleen.

                                 JAMES 
                        Sweet-smellin sheets.  

                                 MARK 
                        Congratulations.

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah.  How you feelin, you good?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, yeah.  I’m good.

                                 JAMES
                        Good, good.  One step at time, 
                        brother.  You get some sleep now.
                                 MARK
                        I will.

                                 JAMES
                        Oh, and Mark?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah?

                                 JAMES 
                        Thanks.

           Beat.

                                 MARK
                        Of course.

                                 JAMES
                        Good night.

           Click.

                                 COLLEEN (O.S.)
                        Who was that?

                                 JAMES
                        Just wrapping things up, baby, you 
                        wanna glass of water?

                                 COLLEEN
                        C’mere.

           She pulls him back to bed, resting her head under his chin.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Stay.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m here.

           And she nestles closer, grabbing his hands and instantly 
           falling back asleep.

           A long silence.  

           SLOW PUSH IN on James, just lying there, staring at the 
           ceiling and blinking in the dark ...  

           A clock ticks somewhere.

           The hum of an air-conditioner.

           James shuts his eyes tight.
           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY 

           An overgrown, neglected yard.

           The sound of a sputtering engine.

           At a picnic table, the kids throw ice at each other and 
           Colleen waves at them, Knock it Off, with a wooden spoon.

           The sputtering engine gets louder and LOUDER and JAMES 
           APPEARS, hunched over, pushing a LAWN MOWER, trudging past 
           his family and he disappears again, the engine fading OFF 
           SCREEN.  

           Colleen swipes a hot dog from one of the kid’s hands, 
           scolding them with it, Keep your hands to yourself, and the 
           mower gets louder and LOUDER, James appearing (red-faced, 
           sweaty) and disappearing again.

           James’ daughter suddenly stands up on the picnic bench, 
           YELLING something, waving his mobile phone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MARK 

           Taking a nap on the couch, a hand shaking him.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Marky Mark, wake-up. 

           Mark’s eyes snap open.  

           INT.  REC ROOM - MORNING

           James hovers over him, the mobile phone pressed to his ear.

                                 JAMES
                             (into the phone)
                        Have you contacted her parents?

           James excitedly paces the room and Mark sits up, rubbing his 
           eyes.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t contact the parents.
                             (mouths to Mark)
                        Outside.
           EXT. FEARING HOUSEHOLD - MORNING

           They walk fast to the parked car in the driveway.

                                 JAMES
                             (into phone)
                        No, no, no, don’t do anything, 
                        we’re on it.  

           Hangs up, starts dialing.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        It’s Holly.

           Mark STOPS at the passenger door.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        She just left treatment.

           He hops into the driver’s seat and turns the ignition, the 
           car idle.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        She’s heading home but we should 
                        have someone at the Drake, just in 
                        case-- 
                             (into phone)
                        Bobby.  Get packed.  You’re goin to 
                        Chicago.
                             (to Mark)
                        Let’s go.

           Mark just stands there.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Probably an hour or so, I’ll talk 
                        to Potts-- 
                             (to Mark)
                        Get in the car.
                             (into phone)
                        Let me worry about the ticket.

           He hangs up and reaches for the passenger door, opening it.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        What are you doin, c’mon, let’s go.

                                 MARK
                        Just.
                                 JAMES
                        What?

                                 MARK
                        Slow down.

                                 JAMES
                             (laughs)
                        All right, OK, fine.

           James turns off the ignition.  

           A silence.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You OK?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah.  

                                 JAMES
                        Sit down.

           Mark sits down.  

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me.

                                 MARK
                        Gimmee a sec.

           Beat.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        This Holly thing. 

                                 JAMES
                        Tough nut to crack.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, well.  Maybe ...

           Beat.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you should, I dunno ... let 
                        someone else-- you know.

           James narrows his eyes.

                                 JAMES
                        No.  I don’t know.
                                 MARK
                        Let someone else take care of this 
                        one.

                                 JAMES
                        You think?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah.  Get your house in order, 
                        before you start--

           A BURST OF LAUGHTER.

                                 JAMES
                        Guy’s outta treatment for thirty-
                        four days, and now he’s tellin me 
                        how to run my business.

                                 MARK
                        No, it’s not like that--

                                 JAMES
                        Here.

           Tosses Mark the phone.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You make the calls.

                                 MARK
                        C’mon.

                                 JAMES
                        You’re some kinda expert.  Save 
                        some lives.

                                 MARK
                        All I’m sayin, is you should slow 
                        down for a second.

                                 JAMES
                             (suddenly)
                        Get out.

                                 MARK
                        What?

                                 JAMES
                        Get outta the car.

           Mark stares at him.  James snatches his phone back.
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Lose my number.

                                 MARK
                        You serious?

                                 JAMES
                        I open my house to you, I give you 
                        a job, I saved your life, for 
                        chrissakes, and you’re gonna tell 
                        me what to do--

                                 MARK
                        No.  I just thought--

                                 JAMES
                        I’m eleven years sober.  I’m a 
                        fuckin rock.  You think I need your 
                        help?
                             (snorts)
                        Get out.

           He turns the ignition.

                                 MARK
                        James.

           James stares forward.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  I am.  I thought I 
                        could help.  You told me I was 
                        getting good at this and ...

           Nothing.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        James.  Please.  I got nothing.  I 
                        got nowhere to go.

           His eyes well up.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Dude.  C’mon.  I’m sorry, OK, I’m 
                        really, really sorry, I-- 
                             (sudden)
                        You don’t have to pay me back for 
                        the hotel, OK?  We’re square.  Or, 
                        or, I’ll work for free for a little 
                        while, just until ...  

           A long silence.
                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me.

           An idle engine.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Well, let’s just take a break, OK, 
                        and ... we’ll talk tomorrow?

           Mark slowly gets out of the car and James violently backs the 
           car out of the driveway, bouncing off the curb--

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                             (calling out)
                        It’s cool, you can borrow--

           The car SCREECHES down the street.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        My car.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           MARK WALKING

           Night.

           His hands are shoved deep in his pockets, hunched over, 
           aimlessly walking down a commercial street, occasionally 
           peering into a dark storefront window.

           He stops.

           “Blame It On Midnight”

           Blinks from a neon sign above him.  A nightclub.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Mark sits at the empty bar counter, staring at his hands.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Whattaya think?

                                 MARK
                        Huh?

                                 BARTENDER
                        To drink.  Whattayou want to drink?
                                 MARK
                        What’s, uh ... 

           Vaguely gestures to the tap.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Bud, Bud Light, Pabst, Miller. 

                                 MARK
                        Hm.

           He bites his lip.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Tough choice, I know.

                                 MARK
                        Bud.

           The Bartender turns his back to him, filling up a tall stein 
           glass--

                                 BARTENDER
                        Quiet night.

           Tops off the foam and turns back to the counter ...

           Mark’s gone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           OVER MARK’S SHOULDER

           Staring at a large suburban house.  

           His home.

           On the front curb, sitting among plastic garbage bags, a 
           rusted BICYCLE and stacks of fiber glass ... is a chair.

           A LA-Z-BOY CHAIR

           Mark slowly goes over to it and wipes the seat with his hand.

           He sits down.  Stares up at the dark house, a bedroom window 
           flickering with the blue light of a television.

           Shoves his hands into his jacket pocket-- finds something.  A 
           folded note.  With his name on it.  He opens it:

           “Easy does it”
           He leans back ... 

           And reclines in his La-Z-boy.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           THE BIG BOOK

           Being cracked open.  Mark sits at a cafeteria table, quiet.

           An AA meeting.

           Fluorescent lights, folding chairs and a handful of middle-
           aged AAs, a serious group, My name is Patrick, I’m an 
           alcoholic, HI PATRICK, everyone working the steps, taking it 
           day by day and the group turns to Mark.

           He bites his lip.

                                 MARK
                        Uh.  My name is Mark.
                             (beat)
                        I’m an alcoholic.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A YMCA PARKING LOT

           Another night, WEEKS LATER, Mark standing with a knot of AA 
           smokers.

           He’s a bit more comfortable now, a cup of coffee in his hand, 
           smiling warmly and laughing at someone’s tragic story.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A FRONT DOOR

           Swinging open.  

           Colleen stands in the doorway, the kids running up and down 
           the stairs behind her.

                                 MARK
                        Hey.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Hey.

           Beat.
                                 MARK
                        Mark.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Sure, I know who you are.

                                 MARK
                        Right, of course.  

           Beat.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Is, uh, James around?

                                 COLLEEN
                        No.  He’s ... you know.  Around.

                                 MARK
                        Right.

           Silence.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Is it an emergency?

                                 MARK
                        Oh, no, no, it’s fine, I just ...

           Another silence.

                                 COLLEEN
                        You OK?

           A shrug.

                                 MARK
                        I’m worried, you know. About James.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Why.  

                                 MARK
                        Well.  He’s been-- you know, with 
                        the whole ...

           She just stares at him, not getting it.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        The divorce ...

                                 COLLEEN
                        What about it.
                                 MARK
                        Nothing, I guess.

                                 COLLEEN
                             (defensive)
                        I love him.  

                                 MARK
                        Of course.

                                 COLLEEN
                        He drives me crazy, but whattayou 
                        gonna do, he’s my husband.

                                 MARK
                        Well, I’m sure you--

                                 COLLEEN
                        There’s nothing you can do.

           End of discussion.

           He bites his lip.

                                 JAMES
                        OK.  
                             (sudden)
                        Thanks.

           He turns to leave, walking to his parked bicycle--

                                 COLLEEN
                        Wait.  I have something for you.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Mark sits at the kitchen table, a tall glass of milk in front 
           of him, the kids eating cookies. 

           A SET OF KEYS are dropped in front of him.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Your car’s in the garage.

                                 MARK
                        Oh.  Thanks.

           She sits down.

                                 COLLEEN
                        I know it’s not normal, you know.
           Mark nods.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m not an idiot.

                                 MARK
                        No.

                                 COLLEEN
                        OK.

           Colleen’s daughter stands on a chair, dunking a cookie into 
           Mark’s glass.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  You have your own milk.  

                                 MARK
                        It’s OK.

           And Colleen’s son crawls up onto Mark’s lap, gnawing on a 
           huge cookie.

           A long silence.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        It’s getting late.  I should 
                        probably go ...

           But he doesn’t move.

           And Colleen doesn’t say anything.  

           And they all just sit there, under the single kitchen light, 
           eating cookies.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A BICYCLE WHEEL

           Clicking and clacking, a playing card in the spokes.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - TWILIGHT

           Mark pedals hard on his rusted bike, wind in his hair, 
           smiling, as he tries to keep up with a four-year old kid 
           riding a bicycle with training wheels.

           MAX.  His son.
           Max breaks ahead of him, turning into the driveway of his 
           former suburban home as Max’s Mom, SHARON, opens the front 
           door.

           Mark stops.

                                 MARK
                        Alright, Mr. Max.  

                                 MAX
                        Dippy’s!

                                 MARK
                        No, not tonight, kiddo, I gotta get 
                        going.

                                 MAX
                        Tomorrow.

                                 MARK
                        Tomorrow, you got it.  Gimmee a lil 
                        somethin.

           Max gives him a kiss.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Don’t give Mom any trouble.

           Mark sits back on his bike seat and gives his ex-wife a 
           little salute.

           She salutes him back.

           And as Mark kicks the kickstand and slowly turns his bike 
           around, Sharon and his son watch him ride down the empty 
           suburban street, weaving in and out of street lamp light, the 
           wheels clicking and clacking, clicking and clacking.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           MARK  

           Standing under a florescent light.  

           A long silence.  (He’s nervous)

           Then.

                                 MARK 
                        I don’t have any friends.
                             (beat)
                        Drinking.  That was my only friend.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARK  (CONT'D)
                             (thinks)
                        And I miss my friend.  But.  I’m 
                        sober now.  And I’m starting to get 
                        out there, you know ... starting to 
                        meet people and see things ...
                             (beat)
                        I saw this couple.  I was driving 
                        down the street, my brain churning 
                        over all my bullshit, you know, and 
                        I just glimpsed out the window and 
                        I saw this teenage couple.  They 
                        had to be, like, fifteen years old 
                        and the girl was leaning up against 
                        the porch wall, stand-offish-- 
                        upset, you know, and the boy said 
                        something, I don’t know what, but 
                        she suddenly lunged for him and 
                        they were hugging each other, 
                        tight, and then they were gone ... 
                             (beat)
                        I don’t really know what I’m sayin.
                             (a crooked smile)
                        I think I’m done.

           He sits down.

           Thank you for your share.

                                                                CUT TO:

           AN EVICTION NOTICE

           Being ripped off a glass door.

           INT. OFFICE - MORNING

           “The National Counselling Intervention Specialist”

           Mark stands at the door, the orange notice in his hand.  

                                 MARK
                        ... hello?

           The place is empty.  

           Phones ring and tropical fish float belly up in aquariums.

           A toilet flush, a DOOR BURSTS OPEN and Potts stumbles out of 
           the bathroom, tucking in his pants.

                                 POTTS
                        Mark. 
                                 MARK
                        Hey.

                                 POTTS
                        Where’s James?

                                 MARK
                        You don’t know?

                                 POTTS
                        Hold up.

           He picks up a phone:

                                 POTTS (CONT’D)
                        National Counselling Intervention

                             (stabs a button)
                        National Counselling Intervention 
                        Specialist, please hold.

           Stabs another button and turns to Mark.

                                 POTTS (CONT’D)
                        You don’t know where he is either?

                                 MARK
                        No, he’s not even pickin up his 
                        phone.
                             (holds up the notice)
                        What’s this?

                                 POTTS
                        Shit.  No, really?

           The phones start BEEPING.

                                 POTTS (CONT’D)
                        Dammit.

           He gets back on the phone:

                                 POTTS (CONT’D)
                        Sorry for the delay, what can I do 
                        for you?

           And Mark stands there for a moment, unsure what to do.

           Then.  

           He sits down at a cubicle.  

           Picks up a phone.
                                 MARK
                        National Counselling Intervention 
                        Specialist, how can I help you?

           INT. ORIGINAL PANCAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mark sits at the head of a table, a BINDER open in front of 
           him.

                                 MARK
                        I’m looking over the books, guys, 
                        and honestly-- we’re sunk.

           Potts, Dee, Spanks, Bobby and Chief.  They all sit around the 
           table, solemnly nodding.

                                 POTTS
                        I predicted this.

                                 MARK
                        These books are a disaster.  I 
                        mean, short of burning the place 
                        down to the ground, I’m not sure 
                        how we can get outta this mess.

                                 BOBBY
                        I know a guy.

                                 MARK
                        No.  Thank you.  But I think this 
                        place is worth saving, so ... hear 
                        me out.

           He leans forward.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Spanks.

                                 SPANKS
                        Yessir.

                                 MARK
                        I got us a pre-intervention meeting 
                        tomorrow morning in Loretto.  

           Eyes wide.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        You wanna give it a shot?

                                 SPANKS
                        Yeah.
                                 MARK
                        Great.
                             (hands him a folder)
                        Details are inside.  Bobby.  I need 
                        you work the phones, alone, cuz I 
                        need everyone else out in the 
                        field, distributing these--

           He dumps a huge stack of PAMPHLETS on the table.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        We all good with that.

           Yeahs, Of Course.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Chief.

           He looks up.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        How am I doin?

           A wink.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        And finally ...

           Throws his hands up.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Where the fuck is James?

                                                                CUT TO:

           JAMES AND HOLLY

           Kissing slowly, sitting on the edge of a bed, just the quiet 
           sounds of their lips moving.

           A roadside motel.

           Heart-shaped bed, smoky mirrors, pink rococo.  

           James touches her breast ... she grabs his hand, entwining 
           fingers.  He touches her other breast with his other hand and 
           then, between kisses:

                                 HOLLY
                        Could we ...

           He tries to unzip her dress.
                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Jimmy?

                                 JAMES
                             (mouth full)
                        Hm?

                                 HOLLY
                        Could we--

           She pulls away.

                                 JAMES
                        What’s the matter.

                                 HOLLY
                        Could we, just, I dunno-- 

           A shrug.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Talk?

                                 JAMES
                             (a smile)
                        Of course, honey, of course--

                                 HOLLY
                        I’m just a little nervous.

                                 JAMES
                        Me too, me too.

                                 HOLLY
                        Sorry.

                                 JAMES
                        No, no, no, don’t be.

           Beat.

                                 HOLLY
                        I like it, our room.

                                 JAMES
                        It’s cool, huh? 

                                 HOLLY
                        All red and pink.  Very honeymoon.

                                 JAMES
                        Very honeymoon.
                                 HOLLY
                        I want our wedding to be just like 
                        this room, all red and pink.

                                 JAMES
                        Absolutely.

           Beat.

                                 HOLLY
                        Here we are.

                                 JAMES
                        So crazy, right?

                                 HOLLY
                        Yeah.

           They shake their heads.  A silence.  

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

                                 JAMES
                        I love you.

           Another silence.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You hungry?

                                 HOLLY
                        I don’t think so, not yet.

           Beat.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Why, are you?

                                 JAMES
                        I could eat.

                                 HOLLY
                        I could eat too.

                                 JAMES
                        You know what-- let’s wait.  We’ll 
                        order room service-- 

                                 HOLLY
                        Yeah!
                                 JAMES
                        Right after we work up an appetite--

                                 HOLLY
                        I’m gonna fuck you so hard.

                                 JAMES
                        You’re nasty.

           Beat.

                                 HOLLY
                        I should call my parents.

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah.

                                 HOLLY
                        Tell them I’m OK, you know, so they 
                        don’t worry.

                                 JAMES
                        Go ahead.

           She looks at the bedside phone.

                                 HOLLY
                        Later.

           Another silence.

           Then. 

           They KISS again, passionately, tearing at each other’s 
           clothes, breathing hard, Holly suddenly shaking, her 
           shoulders trembling, a shrill noise coming between them--

                                 JAMES
                        Hey, hey, what’s the matter?

                                 HOLLY
                        Nothing.

           She’s crying.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Hold me.

           She crawls up into his arms and he cradles her as she 
           uncontrollably sobs his arms.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry, Jimmy, I’m sorry.
                                 JAMES
                        It’s OK, don’t worry--

                                 HOLLY
                        Goddamnit.

           She bolts upright, shaking her head and covering her mouth.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.

           And she runs to the bathroom, slamming the door behind her.

           James just sits there, confused.

                                 JAMES
                             (calling out)
                        You OK in there?

           Nothing.

           He goes to the bathroom and presses an ear to the door.  
           Knocks.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Holly, honey.

           Turns the doorknob ... locked.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  You OK?

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        Could you-- Jimmy?

                                 JAMES
                        What is it.

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        Could you, just, leave me alone.

                                 JAMES
                        ... ok ...

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        Please.  I need a minute.

           And James wanders back into the room, sitting on the bed.

           Stares at the blank TV.

           A muffled RING.
           He JUMPS over the bed, nearly diving for his briefcase (Croco-
           embossed) fumbling for his mobile phone, answering it:

                                 JAMES
                        Dr. James Fearing, yes.

           He stands.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, what?

           Swings on his jacket.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Dee, Dee, hold up, calm down.  
                        Where are you?

           Snatches his briefcase and slips out of the motel room--

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do anything, OK?

           Strides past Holly’s parked PORSCHE, moving fast across the 
           parking lot.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’m on my way.

                                                                CUT TO:

           JAMES JOGGING

           On the side of he road, sweating, his shirt soaked and open, 
           the phone pressed to his ear:

                                 JAMES
                             (leaving a message)
                        POTTS?!  WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?!  
                        We gotta situation with Dee, he 
                        slipped, a relapse, I think, and 
                        I’m meeting him at the Hilton right 
                        now, I can’t seem to reach Bobby or 
                        Chief and I need someone to pick me 
                        up, OK, I need someone to come get 
                        me, like, NOW--

           EXT. HILTON HOTEL - MINNEAPOLIS - MORNING

           A motorcycle with TWO RIDERS screeches into the parking lot.
           James swings off, on the phone, SPRINTING to the hotel 
           entrance as the driver, MILO (fifteen pounds heavier, sober), 
           tries to keep up.

                                 JAMES
                             (leaving another message)
                        Pick up the phone, man, I’m here, 
                        I’m in the lobby--

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MORNING

           James and Milo run past room numbers, STOPPING at an open 
           door.

                                 JAMES
                        DEE, you in there?  I’m comin in.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           James freezes.  

           Everybody’s there:  Colleen, Potts, Dee, Bobby, Chief, 
           Spanks.  All sitting on a couch.  

           And Mark.

           An intervention.

                                 MARK
                        Hey, man.

           He stands.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you have a seat, James.

                                 JAMES
                        You gotta be fuckin kidding me.

           Mark gestures to an empty chair.  He’s the leader.

                                 MARK
                        Have a seat.

                                 COLLEEN
                        I love you honey.

                                 BOBBY
                        We’re here for you, buddy.

           Solemn nods, We care about you, man.
                                 MARK
                        We just wanna say a few things and 
                        then we’ll be outta your hair.

           James blinks.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, you know the drill.

           Mark goes over to him, takes his arm and sits him down.  
           Milo, not knowing what to do, plops down on the bed.

           A nervous silence.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead, Dee.

           A snort.

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, you go ahead Dee.

           Dee sits forward, a letter shaking in his hand.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Look at you.

                                 DEE
                             (reading)
                        “James.  Your behavior has affected 
                        me negatively in the following 
                        ways...”

                                 JAMES
                        You were wearing your pants 
                        backwards when I met you.

                                 DEE
                        “You have fired and re-hired me six 
                        times now--”

                                 JAMES
                        You drank Scope from a bottle, 
                        remember?

                                 DEE
                        And that makes me constantly 
                        insecure and worried for my well-
                        being.

                                 JAMES
                        This is a joke.  Who’s next?
                                 MARK
                        James, please. 
                             (to Dee)
                        Are you finished?

                                 DEE
                        You give some great advice, James, 
                        but you just don’t follow any of 
                        it.

                                 JAMES
                        That all?

                                 DEE
                        That’s it.

                                 MARK
                        Bobby.  Your turn. 

                                 JAMES
                        Really, Bobby?  You got something 
                        to say?
                             (to Milo)
                        This guy used to live under the 
                        Hennepin Bridge.

           Milo nervously laughs.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        At his first meeting, he pissed 
                        himself, right in the middle of his 
                        share.

                                 MARK
                        Go ahead, Bobby.

           Bobby goes to read his letter, but instead folds it and 
           speaks directly to James.

                                 BOBBY
                        I just think you should stay outta 
                        people’s heads and beds for awhile.

                                 JAMES
                        Profound.  Thanks. 
                             (to Spanks)
                        What about you, Spanks?  What words 
                        of wisdom does the spit-back 
                        methadone king have to impart.
                                 SPANKS
                             (reading)
                        “You once said to me, that you 
                        operate in two speeds:  full speed 
                        ahead and fuck it.”  
                             (looks up)
                        James.  It’s time you find another 
                        gear. 

                                 JAMES
                        What are you even talking about, 
                        dude?

                                 MARK
                        JAMES, please.

                                 JAMES
                        What, you think you’re in charge, 
                        Marky?
                             (to Milo)
                        This guy, just weeks ago, was 
                        crying to me -- 
                             (whining)
                        My kids, my wife, my house.

                                 COLLEEN
                        We’re trying to help you, Jim.

                                 JAMES
                        Ah, the withholding bitch speaks.

                                 MARK
                        Stopit--

                                 JAMES
                        Gentlemen, this is Colleen.  Now, 
                        you don’t really know her because 
                        she doesn’t take AA or my career 
                        seriously and doesn’t want anything 
                        to do with you all.

                                 COLLEEN
                        That’s not true.

                                 JAMES
                        Of course, she doesn’t complain 
                        when I pay the bills--

           Mark abruptly stands.

                                 MARK
                        You’re gonna stop it, James, right 
                        now.
                                 JAMES
                        No, no, no, I wanna hear more.  
                        Whattaya got Potts?

           Potts shrugs.

                                 POTTS
                        You’re being a dick.

                                 JAMES
                        You would know.
                             (to Milo)
                        Actually, Milo, you and Potts have 
                        a lot in common.  You both like to 
                        beat the shit outta your wives when 
                        you’re drunk.

           Potts LUNGES for James, Mark getting in the middle.

                                 MARK
                        Hey, hey, hey.

                                 JAMES
                        What’s the matter, Pottsy, you got 
                        something to say to me, huh?  Why 
                        don’t you read your letter, ya 
                        piece a shit, all of you, lemmee 
                        hear your letters, because when you 
                        add up your chips, fellas, it don’t 
                        even come close to my eleven years.

                                 CHIEF 
                        Bullshit.

           The Old-timer speaks.  

           For the first time.  James shuts up. 

           The room gets real quiet.

                                 CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        Now you’re a good kid-- 

                                 JAMES
                        C’mon, Chief--

                                 CHIEF
                        Shut-up.

           He shuts up.
                                 CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        You’ve done us all alotta good ...  
                        Not one of us would be alive if 
                        weren’t for you, ain’t that right?

           Everyone nods.

                                 CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        But you’re gonna sit there--

           He leans forward with a creak.

                                 CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        And listen.  Because we’ve done 
                        alotta listening to you.

           He sits back.

                                 CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        Carry on.

                                 MARK
                        Thank you, Chief.
                             (beat)
                        Colleen.  Why don’t you go next.

           She slowly unfolds her letter.

                                 COLLEEN
                             (reading)
                        “James.”

           And she starts to cry ...

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        “When you love me, there’s nothing 
                        like it.  I feel safe and 
                        protected, like nothing could ever 
                        hurt me.  But when you don’t love 
                        me ...”

           James stares at the floor.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        “It’s like the sun shuts off.”

           She lowers the letter.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        We need help, honey.  What we do... 
                        it’s not good for the kids, your 
                        job, us, it’s not good ... for me.
           James looks at her, a bit shaken.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to Al-Anon.  Will you go 
                        to treatment?  

           He BOLTS to his feet.

                                 JAMES
                        I have to use the bathroom.

           And he runs for the door.

           Mark goes after him, pausing at the door--

                                 MARK
                             (to everyone)
                        I got it, stay here.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           Mark stands outside a hotel bathroom.

                                 MARK
                        James.  You OK in there?

           He knocks.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Listen.  I know this is hard for 
                        you.  But.  Things have really 
                        gotten outta hand, you know, 
                        chasing down Holly and then chasing 
                        down your wife and I just think you 
                        need to stop for a second and be 
                        still.

           Nothing.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        James.  C’mon, we’re all waiting.

           He pushes the door--  LOCKED.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Wha-- ?

           He SLAMS against the door with his shoulder, over and over 
           again--

           HE KICKS THE DOOR
           It bangs open:

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Motherfucker.

           The window is open, a garbage can beneath it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MARK SPRINTING

           Tearing across a busy street, weaving in and out of moving 
           cars, James a hundred yards ahead of him--

           A HONK

           And Mark SLAMS against the hood of a car, rolling off with 
           ease, Sorry, I’m Sorry, and he’s on his feet again, not 
           missing a beat, SPRINTING down a commercial street, weaving 
           in and out of pedestrians and now he’s on James’ heels--

                                 MARK
                        YOU CAN’T KEEP LIVING LIKE THIS!

           CRASH

           A grocery cart topples at Mark’s feet and he LEAPS OVER it, 
           chasing James into--

           A SUPERMARKET

           Heads turning, people SCREAMING as Mark chases James down the 
           frozen food aisle--

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        DRUNK OR SOBER, YOU CAN’T DO THIS 
                        ANYMORE!

           And they’re running down the breakfast aisle, James pulling 
           cereal boxes off the shelves, CHUCKING them at Mark, sugar 
           pops exploding off of Mark’s head, scattering everywhere, 
           crunching underfoot, James disappearing into--

           THE BACK ROOM

           Mark stops dead in his tracks, standing in the middle of the 
           windowless room, craning his neck over boxes and forklifts--

           A FLASH OF LIGHT

           The emergency door KICKED OPEN, ALARMS SHRIEKING, JAMES 
           looking back, grinning, and Mark is off again, tumbling-
           OUTSIDE 

           Into the bright sunlight, blinded for a moment, and he’s on 
           the chase again, pumping his arms and legs, running across 
           another busy street, cars slamming on their brakes, HONKING, 
           and then it’s quiet, just Mark and James’ hard breathing and 
           heavy footfalls, running down a suburban street--

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, James!  Slow down.

           And they’re jogging through a vast public park now, running 
           across a little league diamond and into the vast outfield, 
           slowing down, slower and slower, then--

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        C’mon.

           They stop.  

           Coughing, bent at the waist, in the middle of the lush park.

                                 JAMES
                        How does it feel?

           Between gasps.

                                 MARK
                        What?

                                 JAMES
                        Being close to the flame?

                                 MARK
                        James.

                                 JAMES
                        Trying to prove something to 
                        yourself, huh?

                                 MARK
                        James.

                                 JAMES
                        On the firing line now, man, you’re 
                        on the firing line.

                                 MARK
                        You need help.

                                 JAMES
                        The one that needs help here, 
                        buddy, really needs help, is you.
                                 MARK
                        Don’t.

                                 JAMES
                        I’ve seen you.  I’ve seen the fire 
                        in your eyes, Mark, the struggle 
                        inside, beating it back everyday, 
                        and you’re tired, aren’t you?  
                        Exhausted.  And right now, you’re 
                        not even sure if you can beat this 
                        thing, am I right?

           Mark doesn’t say anything.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I get it, man.  I do.  It’s not 
                        pretty what’s goin on in your head.

           A hand on Mark’s shoulder.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        But that’s why I’m here. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m not just a friend or your 
                        sponsor or a helping hand ... I’m 
                        an awakener.    

           Mark stares at him.  Stone-faced.

                                 MARK
                        You.  

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah.

                                 MARK
                        Are out of control.

           James flinches.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        And you’re going to treatment.

                                 JAMES
                        Really.

                                 MARK
                        It’s all set up.

                                 JAMES
                             (explodes)
                        FOR WHAT?!
           PUSHES him.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been sober for eleven goddamn 
                        years, ELEVEN, never slipping, NOT 
                        ONCE, staying dry and saving lives 
                        on the front line and you’re gonna 
                        tell ME I need to go to treatment?  
                        Who the fuck are YOU, huh?  Some 
                        loser who doesn’t have a pot to 
                        piss in, no job, no wife, no house, 
                        no money, no NOTHING--

                                 MARK
                             (rote)
                        If you accept this Golden Ticket, 
                        we have a flight arranged--

                                 JAMES
                        You’re unbelievable, you know that.

                                 MARK
                        --to a recovery center in 
                        Oconomowoc, Wisconsin--

                                 JAMES
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 MARK
                        --all you have to do is say Yes.

                                 JAMES
                        Mark.  Please.

           A pause.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 MARK
                        Because I care about you.  We all 
                        care about you.

                                 JAMES
                        No, really.

                                 MARK
                        I care about you.

                                 JAMES
                        Bullshit.  Say it.
                                 MARK
                        I told you--

                                 JAMES
                        Fuckin say it, I dare you, because 
                        I know you don’t have the guts to.

                                 MARK
                        What are you--

                                 JAMES
                        Tell me.  Why.

                                 MARK
                        Because.  I care about--

                                 JAMES
                        No, say it.

                                 MARK
                        What?!

                                 JAMES
                        Say the words.

                                 MARK
                        WHAT?!

                                 JAMES
                        Tell me why you’re doin this?!

                                 MARK
                             (blurts)
                        I dunno.

           Beat.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        You.  You’re the reason why I’m 
                        here.  You.  And even though 
                        everything is so bad right now and 
                        I feel so alone and I don’t know 
                        what my future is anymore, I ... I 
                        felt cared for, loved, you know ... 
                        by you.  And I gotta believe in 
                        this, believe in you, or...  
                             (shakes his head)
                        James.  You gotta walk the walk, 
                        man, you gotta be better than you 
                        are ... or I’m finished.  We’re all 
                        finished.  Bobby and Dee and Potts 
                        and Spanks and Chief, all of em.  
                        Colleen.  They love you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                             (beat)
                        I love you.

           A silence.

           Then, a snort.

                                 JAMES
                        Get the hell outta here with that.

           Mark’s face falls.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        “I love you.”  Puh-lease.

           Mark just stands there, frozen.  Slowly shakes his head.

                                 MARK
                        ... you’re sick ...

           He turns away.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m sick, right.

           Mark starts to walk away.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (calling after him)
                        You’re the sick one.

           Nothing.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You know what-- fuck you.  

           Mark picks up the pace.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        FUCK YOU and your sanctimonious 
                        bullshit.

           James just stands there ... a lone figure in an empty 
           pasture.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Aw, c’mon, man.

           He starts to walk after him.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You gotta be tougher than that.  I 
                        love you too, man, I do.  That was 
                        the right answer.
           Mark ignores him, walking faster.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I was testing you and you passed.  
                        You’re a bona fide interventionist 
                        now.

           James starts to jog.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, Marky Mark, come back.  I’m 
                        sorry, OK? 

                                 MARK
                             (over his shoulder)
                        Leave me alone.

                                 JAMES
                        I’ll go to treatment.  You hear me?  
                        I’ll go.

                                 MARK
                        I don’t give a shit.

           James is running now.

                                 JAMES
                        Hold up, man, hold up.

                                 MARK
                        Leave me alone.

           And Mark is running now too.

                                 JAMES
                        Let’s just hug.

                                 MARK
                        Get away from me.

           They’re on the chase again.

                                 JAMES
                        COME BACK, MAN!  I’M SORRY!

           A FULL-SPRINT, both running down another suburban street--

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        COME BACK!

           James REACHES FOR MARK, his hand outstretched in mid-air--
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        COME ON, MARK, DON’T LEAVE ME!

           Nearly catching his shirt, his face twisted with effort, 
           chasing and chasing, two grown men running and running in 
           circles.

           Then.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        I don’t know who I am.

           OFF-SCREEN LAUGHTER

                                 VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        No, seriously, I don’t.  I have no 
                        idea who I am.

           And chasing and chasing, fingers touching Mark’s shirt, just 
           barely, chasing and chasing--

                                 JAMES
                        COME BACK, MAN, C’MON!

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        There was this guy, see.  I only 
                        knew him for a very short while, 
                        but he was a big part of my life.

           Chasing and chasing.

                                 VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He’s in my head still, you know, 
                        talking straight and keeping me 
                        sober, and this guy, a wise man, 
                        once said to me about AA ...

           His fingers graze Mark’s shirt, James’ face lighting up, 
           almost there, almost got it--

                                 VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Thousands come.  Dozens stay.

                                                                CUT TO:

           AN AA MEETING

           MARK stands at the podium, alone under a single light, a dark 
           auditorium spreading out before him.
                                 MARK
                        See, I’m committed to the service, 
                        working the steps, taking it one 
                        day at a time, but I gotta ya--  I 
                        still don’t know who I am.

           A shrug.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        And that’s OK.  Because I do know 
                        one thing ...

           He stares at the audience for a moment.  (a cough)

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I’m one of the dozens.

           He smiles.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Keep coming back.  Thank you.
