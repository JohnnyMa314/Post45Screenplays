               Al Capone controls the city through violence and graft.  His 
                breweries produce 120,000 barrels of illegal liquor daily.  
                          His profits exceed $75 million yearly.

                                   He is 30 years old.

               A Task Force is assembled to combat Capone’s empire.  The man 
                 chosen to lead this task force is a brash young Treasury 
                  Agent with little experience.  His name is Eliot Ness.

                                   He is 26 years old.

                                  This is a true story.
           INT.  CLARK STREET GARAGE - MORNING

           TOMMY GUNS piled on a card table.  The infamous Mob street-
           sweeper, recognizable by the 50 round drum magazines.

           Seven MOB HENCHMEN surround the table, dressed in dark wool 
           suits, overcoats and hats.  Leather shoes stamp the ground 
           for warmth as they exhale puffs of steam.  The sharpest 
           dressed is BUGS MORAN, thick-faced Mob Boss, smoking a cigar.

                                 BUGS MORAN
                        I want a dozen in his head, at 
                        least three times that in the body.  
                        If that scar-faced bastard has 
                        anything but a closed casket--

           WHAM!  The door is kicked open -- instinctively the Henchmen 
           go for the Tommy guns but stop when they hear--

                                 POLICEMAN 1
                        Police!  Let’s see those hands!

           Two POLICEMEN in blue wool and shiny gold buttons enter.  
           Moran and his Henchmen shake their heads, regard the 
           intrusion as a mere nuisance.

                                 POLICEMAN 1 (CONT’D)
                        Everybody line up, face the wall.

           Grumbling the Henchmen comply.  Policeman 1 comes over and 
           pats them down.  Policeman 2 hangs back, keeps his face 
           hidden in the shadows.

                                 BUGS MORAN
                        This a shakedown?

           No reply.  Policeman 1 finishes the pat downs, nods to 
           Policeman 2, who strolls over to the card table and picks up 
           one of the Tommy Guns...

                                 BUGS MORAN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause I already paid up.  Ask your 
                        precinct captain--

           SHICK-SHACK!  Moran stops as Policeman 2 COCKS the Tommy Gun.  
           Moran turns around and his face pales as he sees...

           ALPHONSE GABRIEL “AL” CAPONE.  30 years-old with the solid, 
           muscular build of a prizefighter -- not yet hefting the well 
           known gut and sagging features of prison and late life.  This 
           is a young man, with a full head of dark hair, taut jawline.  
           His eyes are intense, deep, predatory... but eerily 
           unpredictable... the hint of a brain already rotting from 
           syphilis.  And his scar...

           A smooth-bore razor scar runs from just below his left ear to 
           mid-cheek.  As he holds Moran frozen with that swelling 
           stare, he runs his tongue along the inside of his cheek, 
           rolling the scar like a writhing snake.

                                 CAPONE
                        You want to beg, Bugs?

                                 BUGS MORAN
                        Go to hell.

           CRACK!  Capone crushes the right side of Moran’s face with 
           the butt of the Tommy Gun, shoves him back against the wall, 
           then steps back and-- 

           UNLOADS -- sprays bullets across all seven men.  It’s an ugly 
           mess of wool, lead and blood.  When the last man slumps to 
           the ground Capone steps over Moran’s body, calmly exchanges 
           his spent clip for a fresh one on the table, and then unloads 
           again until Moran is unrecognizable.

           Capone and the “Policeman” turn to leave when--

           SOMETHING leaps from the shadows -- Capone swings the Tommy 
           Gun up and into the face of--

           A BARKING DOG -- a German Shepard, chained to the back of a 
           truck.  Capone keeps the gun aimed at the dog and... his 
           demeanor instantly changes and he smiles, gives the dog a 
           friendly tussle behind the ears. 

                                 CAPONE
                        Hiya’, pooch.  Howya’ doing, boy?
                            (to other “Policeman”)
                        Make sure to call this in.  I don’t 
                        want him sittin’ here all day.

           EXT.  CLARK STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Capone and the “Policeman” exit the garage onto a busy 
           sidewalk.  Nobody gives them a second look as they walk 
           casually away from the scene of the crime, dissolving into 
           crush of sharply dressed Sunday Pedestrians in overcoats, 
           fedoras and dresses.

           Pull back from the sidewalk.  Watch as Model A’s, Tudor 
           Sedans and Roadsters prowl the streets.  Rise higher and see 
           a bustling city built of brick and steel,  cosmopolitan and 
           industrial in the same breath.  
           Rise higher and see the iconic “L” tracks crisscrossing above 
           the streets.  Finally, rise high enough to see the harbor on 
           Lake Michigan, packed with ships of all sizes.

                               CHICAGO, 1929

           As POLICE SIRENS echo through the city CUT TO:

           EXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT

           A YOUNG COUPLE in pinstripe suit and flapper dress walk 
           through the shadows and over garbage -- couldn’t look more 
           out of place as they reach an unmarked METAL DOOR.  Pinstripe 
           Suit gives the door two RAPS with his knuckles and a small 
           SLIT opens, a pair of INTENSE EYES peer out.

                                 EYES
                        Yeah?

                                 PINSTRIPE SUIT
                        Jimmy sent me.

           The slit SHUTS hard.   Then... the sound of LOCKS moving and 
           the door OPENS.  A THICK ARM ushers the Couple inside...

           INT.  SPEAKEASY - CONTINUOUS

           Booming sounds of jazz, voices, and glasses clinking.  The 
           walls are brick, the floors bare, but this place is bubbling 
           with energy.  The Couple hand their coats to a COAT CHECK 
           GIRL, then wade into the jumping main room...

           Thick with smoke, booze, sex and youth.  Packed to bursting 
           with 20 YEAR-OLDS in sharp suits and slinky dresses.  
           Everybody is drinking and laughing, flirting and partying.  
           The beating heart of Chicago in the roaring twenties.

           Find a CUTE COCKTAIL WAITRESS in a shorter-than-short skirt 
           as she shimmies up to the BAR and picks up a ROCKS GLASS 
           filled with brown liquor.  Stay with her through the crowd 
           and over to a TABLE IN THE CORNER...

           She sets down the drink and it is immediately picked up by...

           ELIOT NESS.  26 years-old.  He radiates the confidence and 
           invincibility of his young age -- ready to take on the world.  
           Couple that with his dashing good looks, his All-American 
           college boy charm and his cavalier grin... and it’s no wonder 
           the Cutie is batting her eyes at him.

           He takes a sip of the drink and GRIMACES -- the look is 
           perfectly choreographed to elicit a giggle.
                                 NESS
                        That really your best scotch?

                                 COCKTAIL CUTIE
                        Scotch ain’t really our specialty, 
                        if ya’ know what I mean.

                                 NESS
                        Then what is your specialty?

           She gives her lips the most subtle of licks that says she 
           ain’t flirting for tips.  Ness gives her a mischievous grin.

                                 COCKTAIL CUTIE
                        Beer.

                                 NESS
                        Then I’ll take one of those.

           She winks at him, then turns and gives him an extra shake of 
           her shimmy as she cuts through the crowd.  As soon as she’s 
           gone Ness scans the bar, eyes come to rest on...

           The BARTENDER, a wiry little man doling out brown bottles 
           with no labels from beneath the bar--

           CLINK.  One of those brown bottles is set right down in front 
           of Ness.  He reloads his charm and looks up at the Cutie.

                                 COCKTAIL CUTIE
                        So, you waitin’ on anybody, or...

                                 NESS
                        Expecting a few pals any minute.
                            (her face falls)
                        But they won’t stay long.

           He winks at her... and it just isn’t fair.  She almost melts 
           before retreating back into the crowd in a daze.

           Ness takes a sip of the beer.  He nods, not bad, then looks 
           at the brown bottle: no label, just a small CIRCLE with TWO 
           DIAMONDS inside it scratched into the glass.

           He looks back to the Bartender.  He hands a beer to a 
           customer but then quickly turns around and answers a PHONE 
           hidden below the bar.  His FACE changes and before he can 
           hang up he has his hand in the air, signaling to...

           THE BOUNCER by the door -- sees the signal and SLAMS a 
           massive bolt down on the door--

                                 BARTENDER
                        Raid!  Everybody out!  
           PANDEMONIUM.  Ness remains seated as the Customers turn into 
           frightened cattle.  Across the room ANOTHER BOUNCER opens a 
           concealed door in the COAT CLOSET, funnels Customers through.  

           Ness watches the Cocktail Cutie disappear through the door, 
           all thoughts of a late night rendezvous forgotten.  He sighs, 
           then looks back at the bar... the Bartender is GONE.  

           Ness takes another swig of beer and stands up.  Get the first 
           good look at him: lean, athletic build with a stylish suit 
           cut perfectly to show it off. He fights against the crowd to 
           the bar and vaults over it, SEES an open HATCH in the floor.

           INT.  LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Dark, damp, cluttered with barrels and crates.  A canvas-
           backed TRUCK idles by a garage door.  The Bartender loads a 
           crate of beer bottles into the back as the Bouncers drop 
           through the hatch.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Get the barrels in the truck.

           The Bouncers pick up the nearest barrel and heft it into the 
           truck bed.  As they do... the truck engine STOPS.  The 
           Bartender heads around to the cab... the keys are GONE.

                                 NESS (O.S.)
                        Looking for these?

           They all look up to see Ness standing in the middle of the 
           room, holding the KEYS.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hand ‘em over, we’re in a hurry.

                                 NESS
                        That depends on how good your 
                        snitch is.  If he works at the 
                        precinct, then he gave you at least 
                        30 minutes heads up.  If he’s just 
                        a beat cop... then you probably 
                        have more like five.

                                 BARTENDER
                        But we’ll only need one to get 
                        those keys.

           Ness closes his fist around the keys.  Bring it on.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Your funeral, pal.
           The Bouncers converge on Ness from either side.  Ness looks 
           like a featherweight between them.  The First Bouncer steps 
           in and SWINGS a wrecking ball fist at Ness--

           Ness ducks, rolls forward -- holy shit he’s quick -- and JAMS 
           his elbow into the Bouncer’s knee -- his whole body goes off-
           balance and he CRASHES to the grimy floor.

           Ness pops up into a fighting stance as the Second Bouncer 
           lunges for him -- Ness sidesteps, GRABS the Bouncer’s arm and 
           THROWS him hard to the ground -- a perfect Jujitsu toss.

           The Bouncer starts to get up but -- WHAM!  Ness SPINS and 
           KICKS him square in the chest -- sends him toppling into a 
           stack of KEGS -- CRACK!  Beer spills everywhere.

           The First Bouncer tries to get up but Ness throws two 
           lightning fast PUNCHES and sends him back to the floor.

           CRACK!  Ness is taken off his feet as the Bartender 
           blindsides him with a board -- the KEYS go splashing into the 
           beer.  The Bartender rears back for another blow but Ness is 
           too fast, SWEEPS his legs out from under him--

           YELLING, COMMOTION -- Two POLICEMEN drop through the hatch.  
           Ness raises his hands, starts to stand up-- 

                                 NESS
                        Don’t shoot, I’m a--

           BAM!  BAM!  They shoot anyway -- Ness DIVES for cover.  The 
           First Bouncer THROWS a beer keg at the Policemen -- they jump 
           out of the way.  The Bartender grabs the keys from the floor, 
           scampers to the truck and starts the engine--

           Ness tries makes a run for the truck but -- BAM!  BAM!  The 
           policemen drive him back into cover -- The Bouncers take the 
           opportunity and JUMP into the truck as it speeds away.

           Ness watches it go, beyond frustrated, then -- he’s TACKLED 
           by the Policemen and SLAMMED on the ground.  Cuffs go on.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Brilliant, fellas.  Brilliant.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What do you have there?

           The Policemen hoist up Ness so that he can see...

           ALEXANDER JAIME.  By the way the Police snap to attention 
           he’s a man of some power.  About 35, dressed in a 
           conservative suit with impeccable posture.  Looks like a 
           stockbroker with a cool, measured stare... until he sees: 
                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                            (disbelief)
                        Eliot?

           Ness gives him a shrug and a smile.  What can I say?

           INT.  ALEXANDER JAIME’S CAR - LATER

           Ness, still cuffed, gets in the passenger seat and Jaime puts 
           the car in gear.  Jaime tosses Ness a key to the cuffs.

                                 ALEXANDER JAIME
                        You have to stop doing this.  
                        You’re getting a reputation.

                                 NESS
                        Half the cops in this town are on 
                        the take, the other half are too 
                        scared to do anything about it, and 
                        you’re worried about my reputation?  
                        For being what, too honest?

                                 ALEXANDER JAIME
                        A trouble maker.  Two years on the 
                        job and you’ve burnt every bridge 
                        in Chicago.

                                 NESS
                        Hard to burn bridges that were 
                        already rotted out.

                                 ALEXANDER JAIME
                        You’re not listening to me--

                                 NESS
                        You think I should just take my cut 
                        and keep my mouth shut?

                                 ALEXANDER JAIME
                        You’ve been blacklisted.  They’re 
                        going to transfer you. 

           Ness sits back in stunned silence.

                                 NESS
                        How do you know?

                                 ALEXANDER JAIME
                        I just know.

           And then Ness looks out the window -- he realizes something--
                                 NESS
                        Where are we going?

           INT.  ORNATE HOUSE - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Jaime leads Ness past regal furnishings and expensive decor.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE 
                        Speak only when spoken to.  And for 
                        God’s sake don’t ask questions.  
                        These men aren’t accustomed to 
                        being questioned.

           They reach a hardwood door.  Jaime pauses, gives Ness one 
           last look, this is serious, then opens the door.

           INT.  ORNATE HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           A classic leather and hardwood gentleman’s study turned board 
           room for the SECRET SIX: 

           Six MEN in their 60’s-70’s.  White hair, walrus mustaches and 
           gold watch fobs, all sitting in leather club chairs with flat 
           expressions.  Titans of industry.  Power brokers.  The 
           unelected ruling elite of Chicago.   

           Standing in front of them like a child giving a book report 
           is an INCOMPETENT POLICE SERGEANT.  Ness and Jaime stand in 
           the far corner.  Ness doesn’t even try to hide his disdain.

                                 INCOMPETENT SERGEANT 
                        We entered the location and found 
                        some bottles and empty beer kegs.

                                 NUMBER ONE
                        Arrests?

                                 INCOMPETENT SERGEANT
                        No sir.  The place was deserted.  I 
                        doubt it’d been used for some time.

                                 NESS
                        Bullshit.  They were tipped off.

           Brings the room to a screeching halt.

                                 INCOMPETENT SERGEANT
                        That’s not possible--
                                 NESS
                        They got a phone call 5 minutes 
                        before you showed up and cleared 
                        the place out.

                                 NUMBER TWO
                        How do you know this?

                                 NESS
                        Because I was there.

                                 NUMBER TWO
                        Doing what?

                                 NESS
                        Having a drink.

           Alexander Jaime looks like he might pass out.... until the 
           Six begin to chuckle.  No doubt these Men keep their own 
           liquor cabinets, and the answer amuses them.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        I knew there was going to be a 
                        raid.  I wanted to see how things 
                        worked from the inside.

                                 INCOMPETENT SERGEANT
                        I’m sorry, who are you?

           Ness finally steps forward into the center of the room.  His 
           YOUTH is striking in contrast to The Six.

                                 NESS
                        Eliot Ness.
                            (pause)
                        I’m with the Treasury Department.

                                 INCOMPETENT SERGEANT
                            (laughs scornfully)
                        A Prohibition Agent?  The tip-off 
                        probably came from you.
                            (eyes this “kid” 
                             scornfully)
                        What are you, sixteen?

                                 NESS
                            (ignores him)
                        Capone pays $20 for tip-offs on 
                        police raids.  Most of those tip-
                        offs come from police.
                            (pause, looks down at:)
                        Those are nice shoes.
                                 INCOMPETENT SERGEANT
                        I beg your pardon--

                                 NUMBER ONE
                        You may go, Sergeant.

           The Sergeant puffs up his chest and turns to leave.

                                 NESS
                        Twenty-six.
                            (without looking at the 
                             Sergeant)
                        I’m twenty-six.

           The Sergeant, more red faced than ever, exits.

                                 NUMBER THREE
                        You believe he made the tip-off?

                                 NESS
                        No sir, but somebody under his 
                        command did.  And accountability 
                        ends at the top.

           The Six all give him sturdy nods -- that’s the kind of 
           hyperbole businessmen love.

                                 NUMBER ONE
                        You think this raid was a waste of 
                        time, Mr. Ness?

                                 NESS
                            (pause)
                        Yes sir, I do.  Without the tip-off 
                        you get 25 misdemeanor arrests.  
                        Maybe seize 50 gallons of beer, 
                        dozen bottles of really bad scotch.

                                 NUMBER TWO
                        It’s something.

                                 NESS
                        It’s nothing.  They can open that 
                        place back up in 24 hours.  50 
                        gallons?  Drop in the barrel.

           Now NUMBER SIX, the most austere, clears his throat -- the 
           very sound makes the other five sit up and take notice.

                                 NUMBER SIX
                        So far our prosecutorial efforts 
                        have been for naught, Mr. Ness.  We 
                        can’t tie Capone to any illicit 
                        operations.
                                 (MORE)
                                 NUMBER SIX (CONT'D)
                            (pause)
                        What would you propose?

                                 NESS
                        That depends, sir.

                                 NUMBER SIX
                        Depends on what?

                                 NESS
                        Are you serious about taking down 
                        Capone?

           Alexander Jaime blanches.  But Six remains calm.

                                 NUMBER SIX
                        Capone is destroying my city.  
                        After the world’s fair we were 
                        poised to overtake New York as a 
                        center of culture in this country.  
                        But Capone is undoing decades of 
                        progress.  So yes, Mr. Ness.  We 
                        are serious.

           Ness takes that in, nods...

                                 NESS
                        You go after his money, sir.  It 
                        buys his muscle, his protection 
                        with the police and the judges and 
                        the politicians.  You can’t hurt 
                        Capone by targeting his patrons.  
                        But you can hurt him by targeting 
                        his supply.  
                            (pause)
                        Hit his breweries, not his bars.

           A long moment.  Number Six fingers his mustache...

                                 NUMBER SIX
                        Mr. Jaime speaks very highly of 
                        you, Mr. Ness.  I can see why.

           Judging by the looks on the other five’s faces, some kind of 
           approval has just been given.

                                 NUMBER ONE
                        How many men would it take?

                                 NESS
                        Fewer the better.  No more than 10, 
                        working as a small unit.
                                 NUMBER TWO
                        And you’d want to be on this task 
                        force, I presume?

                                 NESS
                        No sir.  I’d want to run it.

           Wow.  Took a lot of balls to say that to these men, and it 
           shows on their faces.  But...

                                 NUMBER SIX
                        Very well.  
                            (pause)
                        Mr. Jaime will make sure you get 
                        whatever you need.  You don’t 
                        report to the Treasury Department.  
                        You don’t report to the Police.  
                        You report to us.
                            (pause)
                        Give us results, Mr. Ness.

           INT.  BETTY’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING

           The All-American Rockwellian home.  Nice china, half-eaten 
           golden-brown turkey on the table with all the trimmings.  At 
           one end of the table is MR. ANDERSON, gray-haired patriarch 
           in Sunday slacks and cardigan.  At the other end is MRS. 
           ANDERSON, portrait of a homemaker, still wearing her apron.

           Ness sits in the middle, perfectly mannered and groomed, his 
           eyes across the table on...

           BETTY ANDERSON.  25 and a glowing girl-next-door beauty.  
           Wearing the same conservative style dress as her mother -- 
           housewife in training... But a clever gleam in her eye says 
           she could be so much more.

                                 MRS. ANDERSON
                        Can’t you tell us anything about 
                        it, Eliot?

                                 NESS
                            (coy)
                        Let’s just say I’ll be going after 
                        a certain organization that 
                        provides... a certain service.

                                 BETTY
                        You mean Al Capone.

           Ness flashes that cavalier grin, shrugs it off.  Mrs. 
           Anderson looks positively titillated.  Betty, however, seems 
           a little more concerned...
                                 MRS. ANDERSON
                        That sounds dangerous.

                                 NESS
                        It’s not like I’ll be shooting it 
                        out with Capone himself.
                            (reassuring smile)
                        Two months, tops, and we’ll have 
                        him behind bars.

           Betty doesn’t seem so sure, but puts on a brave face. 

           INT.  RIVIERA MOVIE THEATER - LATER

           A beautiful gold and red velvet theater, PACKED with trendy 
           young COUPLES in three piece suits and dresses. 

           Ness and Betty sit together.  Betty watches the screen, Ness 
           watches Betty... and slowly moves his hand to hold hers... 
           but she draws her hand away, gives him a chiding look.  Ness 
           smiles, I know... then looks around Betty at:

           MR. and MRS. ANDERSON sitting on the other side of Betty.  
           Ness settles back into his seat as...

           ON SCREEN: A newsreel starts.  Grainy, herky-jerky footage of 
           Chicago fills the screen with the title “City Under Siege!”

                                 ANOUNCER (ON SCREEN)
                        Notorious Gangster Al Capone cuts a 
                        swath of destruction across the 
                        once peaceful city of Chicago.  Law 
                        abiding citizens lock their doors 
                        as their streets are turned into a 
                        war zone.

           Various images of shootouts, liquor barrels, the aftermath of 
           the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre... and CAPONE.  Ness watches 
           it all, rapt.

                                 ANOUNCER (ON SCREEN) (CONT’D)
                        From his plush apartments in the 
                        Lexington Hotel, Capone reigns over 
                        organized crime like a Caesar.

                                 BETTY
                        They talk about him like he’s a 
                        movie star.

                                 NESS
                            (smiles)
                        Yeah... imagine how they’ll talk 
                        about the guy who locks him up.
           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - DAY

           The room is FULL of file boxes, stacked waist high all 
           around.  File folders are scattered everywhere,  Ness has his 
           nose in one as Alexander Jaime enters.  Ness tosses the file 
           into a SMALL PILE (about 50) on the floor, picks up another.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        Honest men that hard to find?

           As if to answer Ness tosses aside another file.  Jaime looks 
           at the pile.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Rejects?

                                 NESS
                        Yes.

           Jaime points to another pile, twice as big as the first.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        And those?

                                 NESS
                        Should all be in jail.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                            (picks up a file)
                        What wrong with this one?  
                        Detective, 10 year veteran--

                                 NESS
                        He’s married.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        That a problem for you?

                                 NESS
                        Would your wife let you run around 
                        town in the middle of the night?

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        You tell me... she’s your sister.

                                 NESS
                        Do they even know that I’m your 
                        brother-in-law?

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        Of course they know.  They think 
                        it’s added motivation.  For me.

           Ness nods, tosses aside yet another file.
                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        So... what are you looking for?

                                 NESS
                        The Chicago PD training manual for 
                        new recruits was written in 1901.  
                        They haven’t changed procedures in 
                        almost 30 years...  And Capone 
                        knows that.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        You want to rewrite the manual--

                                 NESS
                        I’m saying that I want a team that 
                        doesn’t have a manual.  Something 
                        that nobody has ever seen before.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        And where do you find that?

           INT.  PRECINCT TELEPHONE EXCHANGE - DAY

                                 NESS (V.O.)
                        Where nobody else has looked.

           Beehive of activity. Two dozen WOMEN work the switchboards, 
           constantly pulling and plugging connections.  The chatter of 
           voices and buzzing phones is maddening, and Ness and Jaime 
           cringe as they finish talking to a TRENDY LOOKING MAN.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                            (as the Man leaves)
                        Him?

                                 NESS
                            (shaking his head)
                        Shoes are too nice.

           Jaime looks down and, sure enough, he’s wearing expensive 
           wing-tips, buffed to a mirror shine.  Before Jaime can say 
           anything another PAIR OF SHOES walk toward them -- plain 
           brown lace-ups.  Simple, classic... cheap.  They belong to:

           PAUL ROBSKY.  27 and wound way too tight.  His suit is 
           fastidiously clean and creased.  Nothing out of place.  As he 
           maneuvers around the Women he flinches at the chatter, clacks 
           his teeth nervously.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Paul Robsky?
                                 ROBSKY
                        Yes?

                                 NESS
                        My name’s Eliot Ness.  I’m putting 
                        together a special unit and I need 
                        somebody who’s good with phones.

           Robsky is half listening, half starring at a GUM WRAPPER that 
           has fallen to the floor beside a trash can... 

                                 ROBSKY
                        Well, I’m your man, Mr. Ness -- I 
                        can wiretap, run patches -- you 
                        name it, but... um...
                            (eyes on the wrapper)
                        Who’s the, uh, target...

           He can’t help himself, dashes over and puts it in the trash.

                                 NESS
                        Al Capone.

           Robsky almost chokes.  A moment, he ponders, then looks back 
           at the chaos that is the exchange, back at Ness and...

                                 ROBSKY
                        Will it get me out of here?

           INT.  PRECINCT GARAGE - DAY

           Loud with growling engines and MECHANICS servicing vehicles.  
           Ness and Jaime confer with a Mechanic who points them across 
           the room to a CUSTOM CAR -- double thick glass, reinforced 
           doors, hood open to expose a muscular, suped-up engine.  A 
           PAIR OF LEGS stick out from under it.

           As Ness and Jaime approach they see that the legs are wearing 
           a pair of ratty, scuffed-up shoes.

                                 ALEXANDER JAIME
                        Certainly fits your criteria.

                                 NESS
                        Joe Leeson?

                                 LEESON (UNDER CAR)
                        Just rev the engine.

           Ness and Jaime exchange a confused look, then...

                                 MECHANIC (ACROSS THE ROOM)
                        Hey Joe!
           The Mechanic REVS the engine of a car--

                                 LEESON (UNDER CAR)
                        Fan belt’s shot!

           Ness and Jaime exchange an impressed look.

                                 NESS
                        This is a nice car.

                                 LEESON (UNDER CAR)
                        Impact resistant body, fuel-
                        injection V-8, bulletproof glass.

                                 NESS
                        Bullet proof?  Does it work?

                                 LEESON (UNDER CAR)
                        Of course it works...

           Leeson finally rolls out from under the car.  30 years-old 
           with matted hair and oil-stained, mismatched clothes.  His 
           face is flat, dry, and dripping with sarcasm -- the trademark 
           of a lifelong cynic.

                                 LEESON (CONT’D)
                        ...but they won’t let me try it.

           Ness considers that a moment, then...

           Draws his pistol and -- BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  Fires right into 
           the windshield -- Mechanics yell and dive for cover.  Leeson 
           doesn’t even flinch.  If he’s intimidated, confused or 
           impressed... he doesn’t show it.

           And sure enough... the bullets don’t leave a scratch.

                                 LEESON (CONT’D)
                            (to Jaime)
                        He always like this?

                                 ALEXANDER JAIME
                        On his good days.

           INT.  POLICE STATION - DAY

           BILL GARDNER, 26 years-old, sits at a desk reading.  He’s 
           built like a tank, full of country muscle, biceps practically 
           bulging out of his police uniform.

           Ness and Jaime watch him from across the room.
                                 ALEXANDER JAIME
                        He looks like a linebacker.

                                 NESS
                        Tight end, actually.  Yale.

                                 ALEXANDER JAIME
                        Did he actually attend classes?

           Jaime points to what Gardner is reading... a comic book.  
           Ness walks over to Gardner and takes the comic book out of 
           his hands... revealing a THICKER BOOK behind it: “Principles 
           of Explosives and Demolition, Volume III.”

           Gardner looks up at Ness inquisitively.

                                 NESS
                            (holds up the comic book)
                        A little light reading?

                                 GARDNER
                        For some unfathomable reason, 
                        intelligence is frowned upon here.

                                 NESS
                            (conspiratorially)
                        Because it’s a police station.

           Gardner cracks a smile, very amiable.  Ness nods to the book.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Ever put that stuff into practice?

           Gardner’s eyebrows shoot up excitedly.

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           The Team is assembled.  They’re a YOUNG group, clean cut and 
           handsome, full of smiles and energy.  Could easily pass for 
           an Ivy League fraternity if not for the shoulder holsters.  

           If it were legal, they’d be fun to drink with.

                                 NESS
                        Our mandate is simple: shut down 
                        Capone’s cash flow by attacking the 
                        production of booze in the city.

           KNOCK!  They all look up as the door swings open to reveal:
           MARTY LAHART.  27 with a rubbery smile plastered on his face.  
           He has all the style you can buy from the back of a comic 
           book, and the charm of a penny circus huckster.  Suffers from 
           an abundance of personality.

                                 MARTY
                        This the shrink’s office?  ‘Cause 
                        I’m supposed to report to some unit 
                        out to get Capone... so I must be 
                        off my nut.

           A few laughs -- hard not to like this guy.

                                 NESS
                        Gentleman, this is Marty Lahart.  
                        Don’t be fooled by that goofy 
                        grin... he’s actually quite stupid.

           Marty LAUGHS, swaggers in and shakes Ness’s hand -- they both 
           smile broadly, good to see you.  Ness motions to the rest of 
           the Team, Marty shakes their hands one by one:

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Paul Robsky, Joe Leeson, and--

                                 MARTY
                            (recognizes)
                        Bill Gardner.  Yale, ‘26.

           Marty shakes Gardner’s hand with extra enthusiasm -- he 
           barely comes up to his chin. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        I saw you score three touchdowns 
                        against Harvard.  Great game.

                                 GARDNER
                        Thanks.

                                 MARTY
                        Should’ve been five.  Their defense 
                        was lousy.

           Gardner looks like he’s been slapped in the face.  Everybody 
           else laughs.  Frat house atmosphere.  Young guys having fun.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not funny -- I had ten bucks 
                        on that game...
                                 NESS
                        Like I was saying, our plan is to 
                        cut off Capone’s supply at the 
                        source -- leave the bars and 
                        bottles to the beat cops.  We’re 
                        hitting breweries.  I want to 
                        measure our progress in gallons.
                            (pause)
                        There has never been a unit like 
                        this in law enforcement.  Our 
                        weapons and tactics will be unique.   
                        The mob expects police to be 
                        predictable.... so we will be 
                        unpredictable.  We will hit them 
                        hard and we will hit them fast and 
                        when we’re done the only thing left 
                        will be splintered doors and empty 
                        barrels.
                            (pause)
                        Sound good?

           They team HOOTS and CHEERS -- sounds damn good to young guys 
           like this.  But just one thing...

                                 ROBSKY
                        How do we find the breweries?

           EXT.  WABASH AVENUE - DAY

                                 NESS (V.O.)
                        Every bar in town gets its beer 
                        from someplace.  We just wait for 
                        the deliveries.

           Cars and Pedestrians pay no notice to the FORD TUDOR SEDAN 
           parked on the corner.

           INT.  CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Leeson is at the wheel, Ness shotgun, Marty in the back.  
           They stare through the windshield at the same ALLEY that 
           housed the Speakeasy.  Now deserted.

                                 MARTY
                        Maybe they moved to another spot.

                                 NESS
                        No way.  Business was booming.

                                 MARTY
                        They have scotch?
                                 NESS
                        Worst I ever tasted.

                                 MARTY
                        Shame.

           Then an unmarked canvas backed TRUCK turns into the alley.

                                 NESS
                        Here we go.

                                 MARTY
                        That truck doesn’t look like it’s 
                        carrying much weight.

                                 LEESON
                        Reinforced suspension -- mob rigs 
                        ‘em up so they can carry a few 
                        thousand pounds before they sag.

           TWO MEN (recognize them as the Bartender and Bouncer) come 
           out of the shadows and pull back the canvas flaps to reveal: 
           a DOZEN WOODEN KEGS.  They begin unloading.

                                 MARTY
                        The balls on these guys, doing it 
                        in broad daylight.

                                 NESS
                        Well, look at it from their 
                        perspective... whose got the balls 
                        to stop them?

           The Bouncer removes the last barrel and the truck pulls out 
           of the alley and back onto the street.

                                 MARTY
                        Now what?

                                 NESS
                        They make their deliveries, then we 
                        follow them back to the source.

           EXT.  FACTORY - NIGHT

           A Large brick building.  Windows and doors boarded up.  Quiet 
           like a cemetery until...

           A MAN darts across the gravel truck paths, stays low, he has 
           a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN in his hands.  As the moon hits him 
           realize it’s Ness -- he joins Leeson and Gardner in the 
           shadows against the building.  Gardner holds a Tommy Gun that 
           looks like a toy in his massive hands.
                                 NESS
                        Marty and Robsky will hit them from 
                        the back door.  We go at the same 
                        time -- 1:20 on the dot.

           They slink along the building to a a large wooden door that 
           looks almost rotted through.  Ness checks his watch... waits 
           for the second hand to come around and... 1:20 on the button.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Hit it.

           Gardner KICKS the door -- it SPLINTERS APART--

           Revealing a METAL DOOR behind it.  Gives them all pause.

                                 LEESON
                        That’s solid steal.

           Ness stares at it a moment, then BLAM!  BLAM!  Fires two 
           blasts where the hinges should be.  KICKS the door and -- 
           BOOM!  Nothing but a loud noise.

                                 NESS
                        Aw hell.

           BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Ness keeps firing around the door frame, 
           splintering the wood.  Another kick -- nothing.  BLAM!  BLAM!  
           BLAM! The night is split apart by a cacophony of shotgun 
           blasts against metal.  Gardner winces, Leeson plugs his ears.

           BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Finally there is a GROAN... and the door 
           simply FALLS backwards out of its mangled frame.

           INT.  FACTORY FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ness charges inside -- Leeson and Gardner behind him--

                                 NESS
                        Federal agents!  Nobody move!

           But there’s nobody there.  There are several wooden counters 
           and tables, a metal staircase leading up to a second floor 
           catwalk, large double doors at one end and a garage door at 
           the other.  Completely empty.  Half-smoked cigarettes smolder 
           in an ashtray, half-eaten sandwich on a table.

                                 LEESON
                        Should’ve just rung the door bell.

                                 GARDNER
                        Shut up, Leeson.
           NOISE from behind the double doors.  Ness raises his shotgun, 
           starts toward them and...

           VROOM!  Suddenly the doors EXPLODE OPEN as a CAR drives right 
           through them -- straight at Ness--

           Ness raises his shotgun to fire but -- CLICK!  Empty.  He 
           DIVES out of the way as the car rockets through the room and 
           BURSTS through the garage door easily--

           Ness drops his shotgun -- Gardner tosses him the Tommy Gun 
           and Ness takes aim at the back wheels of the truck and -- the 
           gun JAMS.  Ness scowls, watches the car disappear.

                                 MARTY (O.S.)
                        You get ‘em?

           Marty and Robsky come running through the double doors.

                                 NESS
                        Where the hell were you?  I said 
                        1:20 on the button.

                                 MARTY
                        And here we are.

           Ness grabs Marty’s arm and pulls back his sleeve to reveal 
           his watch, holds it next to his own.

                                 NESS
                        Oh you gotta’ be kidding me...

           Marty looks down at the two watches... Ness’s watch is THREE 
           MINUTES AHEAD of Marty’s.

                                 MARTY
                        No wonder I’m always late.

                                 NESS
                        Okay... There’s booze in here 
                        someplace, let’s find it.

           The Team fan out in all directions.  Marty goes back through 
           the double doors, Gardner goes up the stairs to the catwalk.

                                 GARDNER (O.S.)
                        Ness...

           Ness looks up at Gardner on the catwalk, pointing to a ladder 
           that leads to the roof... and a hatch.

                                 GARDNER (CONT’D)
                        Looks like most of them went out 
                        through the roof.
           Ness kicks the ground, should have thought of that.  Marty 
           peaks his head through the double doors.

                                 MARTY
                        You should take a look at this.

           INT.  FACTORY WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ness and the rest of the Team push through the doors... and 
           stop in their tracks as they see BARRELS...

           THOUSANDS of barrels, stacked 50 high to the ceiling, in row 
           after row after row.  And all marked with the Capone circle 
           and double-diamond.  Ness breaks into a broad smile.

                                 NESS
                        Jackpot.

                                 MARTY
                        Uh... not exactly.

           Marty KNOCKS on one... a hollow THONK THONK resonates.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        All empty.  They don’t brew 
                        anything here.

           Then Marty points to a corner... there is a pile of hoses, 
           brushes and long handled scrubbers.  Water and soapsuds are 
           pooled.  Ness’s face falls as he realizes... 

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE (V.O.)
                        An entire warehouse just for 
                        cleaning their barrels?

           EXT.  LINCOLN PARK - DAY

           Ness and Alexander Jaime sit on a park bench looking out over 
           Lake Michigan.

                                 NESS
                        We counted just over five thousand.  
                        I figure that’s just a fraction of 
                        their rotation.

           Jaime sighs.  Ness pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        What’s this?

                                 NESS
                        List of equipment.
           Jaime’s eyes nearly bulge out of his skull as he reads it.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        Do you know how much all of this 
                        will cost?

                                 NESS
                        I thought you were supposed to get 
                        me what I need.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        Well yes, but... they’re not happy 
                        right now. 

                                 NESS
                        They heard about the raid?

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        The whole city heard about it.

                                 NESS
                        Capone is better armed than we are.  
                        Better equipped.  I’m just trying 
                        to make it a fair fight.

           Jaime looks at the list again, heaves a resigned sigh.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        You really think the whole city 
                        heard about it?

           INT.  LEXINGTON HOTEL - CAPONE’S SUITE - NIGHT

           RAUCOUS LAUGHTER is thicker than cigar smoke.  MOBSTERS in 
           sharp suits and PEARL GRAY HATS (the Capone gang trademark) 
           form a makeshift boxing ring around the edges of the opulent 
           velvet-and-gold apartment.  Money changes hands as they watch 
           a fight between a hulking GORILLA of a Man and...

           CAPONE.  Stripped of his shirt, suspenders hanging around his 
           waist, slick with sweat.  See he’s in good shape, a lot of 
           muscle packed onto that frame.  And he’s surprisingly fleet 
           of foot -- he glides across the carpet more like a dancer 
           than a fighter.

                                 CAPONE
                        Who the hell are these guys, the 
                        keystone cops?

           Sitting to one side is a sharply dressed man with jet black 
           hair.  FRANK NITTI.  He holds a LITTLE BLACK BOOK in his 
           hands, jots notes with a stubby pencil.  He has the intense 
           focus of an accountant, all the warmth of an undertaker.
                                 FRANK NITTI
                        Treasury Department task force.

           Capone DODGES a massive punch from the Gorilla, counters with 
           a lightning fast one-two combination.

                                 FRANK NITTI (CONT’D)
                        Leader is a man named Eliot Ness.

                                 CAPONE
                        Sounds like a dandy.

           Capone absorbs a HARD SHOT to his chin, knocks him back a few 
           steps but he shakes it off -- his head must be made of stone.

                                 FRANK NITTI
                        Should I put them on the payroll?

                                 CAPONE
                        I’m not bribing guys that are too 
                        dumb to make an arrest.

           More laughter -- Capone joins in for a moment and then...

           His face changes -- smile disappears, eyes go flat like a 
           viper.  He lashes out and -- CRACK!  Lands a lightning-quick 
           blow to the Gorilla’s nose -- blood explodes and--

           Capone attacks like a rabid dog -- a vicious combination of 
           punches send the Gorilla stumbling -- the Mobsters make way 
           as he CRASHES against the wall like a fighter on the ropes.  

           Capone was just toying with the poor bastard until now...

           He doesn’t relent, keeps pounding on him with meaty fists as 
           the Gorilla slowly sinks to his knees and then collapses.

           Finally Capone stops.  The laughter is gone, the room is 
           silent.  Only Nitti seems unfazed by the savage beating, 
           keeps jotting notes in his black book.  And then... Capone’s 
           smile rolls back onto his face like nothing happened.

                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        Any other business?

           INT.  OLD TRANSPORTATION BUILDING GARAGE - DAY

           CLOSE ON: a wooden crate with a black “US ARMY” stencil 
           across the top -- a crow bar pops the lid to reveal five 
           BRAND NEW Thompson Submachine Guns, packed in straw.
           There are a dozen Army crates lying around, all opened to 
           reveal brand new weaponry: Remington M1911 pistols, 
           “Pineapple” Hand Grenades, Winchester 12-Guage Pump Action 
           Shotguns, and Browning Automatic Rifles (BARs) -- nasty-big 
           rifles that can sweep an entire street.

                                 MARTY
                            (picks up two pistols)
                        Who’s footing the bill for this?

                                 NESS
                        Anonymous benefactor.

                                 MARTY
                        Excellent.

           Marty grabs FOUR MORE pistols and walks away with them.  Ness 
           shakes his head, then walks across the garage.  He passes 
           Gardner, who is DELICATELY unpacking strange PUTTIES and 
           POWDERS from his own crate.

           Ness reaches Leeson, who is under the hood of...

           A BRAND NEW FORD ROADSTER, one of FOUR lined up like a chorus 
           line.  The MUSCLE CARS of the day.

                                 NESS
                        That going to work?

                                 LEESON
                        90 degree flathead V8 engine, fuel 
                        injection... it’s adequate.

           Leeson shuts the hood, wipes his hands on his pants, then 
           nods down the line to a large ARMY TRUCK.

                                 LEESON (CONT’D)
                        What’s that one for?

           Ness unfolds a large piece of paper onto the hood of the 
           car... it’s a diagram of some sort.

                                 NESS
                        I was hoping you could put together 
                        something like this.

           Leeson leans over, studies the mysterious diagram.

                                 LEESON
                        Oh yeah, I can do this no problem.

           Ness just pats him on the back, then...
                                 NESS
                        One last thing...

                                                               CUT TO:

           A polished wooden box opens to reveal... five beautiful, 
           shiny new WRIST WATCHES.  All PERFECTLY synchronized.  Ness 
           picks up the first one and hands it to Marty.

                                 MARTY
                        Aw hell, now I have to be on time.

           INT.  WAREHOUSE BREWERY - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Barrels stacked twenty feet high on one side, canvas backed 
           trucks on the other.  In the middle an enormous metal VAT.

           WORKERS in stained coveralls stir the vat from catwalks with 
           canoe paddles.  More workers tote sacks of grain and sugar.  
           Even more load barrels into the back of a truck.  The scope, 
           scale and efficiency of the operation is impressive.

           5 MOBSTERS in Pearl Gray Hats stand out amidst the hustle and 
           bustle.  Two by the STEEL front door, two more on the 
           catwalks.  The fifth is BERATING the crew loading the truck.

                                 JOHNNIE LAMB
                        Move your asses -- I shoulda’ been 
                        gone an hour ago! 

           This is JOHNNIE LAMBOSSA.  Johnnie “Lamb.”  Vulgar, abusive, 
           and not a handsome man despite obsessive styling and gaudy 
           clothes.  He has a big jaw that accommodates his big mouth.

           Suddenly, over the din of the workers, there is a RUMBLING.

                                 JOHNNIE LAMB (CONT’D)
                        Aw, what now?

           The rumbling gets louder -- it’s coming from OUTSIDE.

                                 MOBSTER
                        Want me to check it out?

                                 JOHNNIE LAMB
                        No, I want you to stand there with 
                        your thumb up your ass.

           Takes the Mobster a minute to identify the sarcasm, then he 
           opens the PEEP HOLE on the steel door -- just that little 
           opening makes the rumbling EVEN LOUDER.  The Mobster looks 
           through the peep hole and his eyes go wide--
                                 MOBSTER
                        Holy shit!

           He DIVES aside as the door -- and the WALL -- are completely 
           DEMOLISHED by--

           A MODIFIED TRUCK -- massive steel PLOW on the front and 
           double-thick glass on the windows.  Looks like a armored car.

           Brick, steel, debris go everywhere -- Mobsters and Workers go 
           for cover -- Johnnie Lamb makes an especially terrified dive 
           for protection.  After a moment everything settles and...

           INT.  RAID TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Ness is in the passenger seat, Leeson at the wheel.  Both 
           look stunned by the devastation.

                                 LEESON
                        I’ll be damned.  It worked.

           Ness picks up a handheld CB radio wired into the dash:

           INTERCUT WITH WAREHOUSE

           Ness’s voice BLARES from a MEGAPHONE mounted on the truck.

                                 NESS
                        We are Federal Agents.  Drop your 
                        weapons and put your hands up.

           Johnnie Lamb looks laughingly at the truck, just two men 
           inside... then looks at his Mobsters.

                                 JOHNNIE LAMB
                        Kill ‘em!

           The Mobsters OPEN FIRE -- the bullets bounce off the 
           reinforced glass, leaving no more than scuffs.

                                 LEESON
                        Did you actually figure they would?

                                 NESS
                        We’re the good guys -- gotta’ give 
                        them the option.

           CRACK!  The windshield begins to spiderweb.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        You’re sure this thing will hold?
                                 LEESON
                        Of course.
                            (another CRACK, pause...)
                        How much longer do you need?

                                 NESS
                            (checking his watch)
                        Oh, about 5 seconds...

           THE WATCH: the second hand comes around to the 12 and--

           BOOM!  Right on cue the BACK WALL of the warehouse EXPLODES -- 
           throws brick everywhere and opens a HOLE big enough for--

           MARTY and GARDNER to storm in--

           Marty fires two pistols at once -- fires them so fast that 
           he’s empty in seconds -- but he just DROPS them, reaches into 
           his coat and pulls out TWO MORE -- as is coat is open see 
           that he has SIX HOLSTERS strapped across his body.

           Gardner unloads with a BAR.  The Mobsters dive for cover as 
           bullets fly -- Johnnie Lamb doesn’t even shoot back, just 
           runs like a girl.

           Ness and Leeson jump out of the Truck -- Ness opens up with a 
           Tommy Gun and Leeson with a Shotgun -- The Workers drop 
           everything and scramble up the ladders and catwalks--

           EXT.  ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           The Workers scramble out a hatch and come face to face with 
           the BARREL OF A GUN, held by Robsky.  He smiles.

           INT.  WAREHOUSE BREWERY - CONTINUOUS

           The Two Mobsters on the catwalk fire down on the Team -- 
           everybody takes cover.  Ness and Marty end up behind the Vat.  
           At the same time the other two Mobsters fall back behind the 
           stacks of barrels and dig in.

           Now it’s a nasty fire fight.  Gardner unloads with the BAR -- 
           heavy caliber bullets shred barrels like cardboard.  Marty 
           and Ness try to fire but the Mobsters behind the barrels have 
           them pinned down.

                                 MARTY
                        Is this how you drew it up in your 
                        head, Chief?

           Ness ignores him, takes a pineapple grenade from his coat, 
           pulls the pin and drops it right beneath the vat--
                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Oh hell--

           They both SPRINT away from the vat -- Marty dives behind the 
           Raid Truck but Ness runs and JUMPS onto a pile barrels, 
           CHARGES up the slope created by them until he’s on top of the 
           30 foot high stacks--

           The Mobsters on the catwalk fire at him -- bullets hit all 
           around him, splintering barrels and then he--

           BOOM!  The grenade BLOWS -- The explosion destroys the base 
           of the vat and it TIPS over -- a TIDAL WAVE of beer crashes 
           to the floor--

           The force of the beer is so strong that it hits the stacks of 
           barrels and TOPPLES them like dominoes -- barrels fall almost 
           out from under Ness’s feet as he keeps running and then--

           LAUNCHES himself off the top of the barrels and ONTO the 
           catwalk, right behind the Mobsters--

           He SPINS and KICKS the first Mobster right off the catwalk-- 

           DOWN BELOW the two Mobsters behind barrels stop firing as 
           they see the WAVE of beer cascading right for them -- before 
           they can react their feet are taken right out from under them 
           by the undertow of beer--

           NESS ducks and rolls as the Second Mobsters fires right over 
           his head -- Ness pops up and -- WHAM!  WHAM!  Punch to the 
           stomach, face -- the Second Mobster flies off the catwalk--

           The remaining two Mobsters pull themselves out of the beer 
           and barrels and FIRE at Ness above them--

           Bullets hit all over the catwalk and -- Ness FIRES his pistol 
           at the BOLTS securing the catwalk to the wall -- BAM!  BAM! 
           BAM!  Perfect shots and the bolts RIP away from the wall--

           The catwalk breaks free, Ness SLIDES down the new incline 
           created -- straight at the Mobsters.  He fires at them, 
           drives them for cover and then LANDS right between them and 
           WHAM!  WHAM!  Knocks them both on their asses...

           ACROSS THE ROOM -- JOHNNIE LAMB slinks out of his hiding 
           spot, aims his pistol at an unaware Ness and...

                                 MARTY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Not very sporting, don’t you think?

           Johnnie looks up as -- CRACK!  Marty DECKS him right in the 
           nose -- Johnnie SCREAMS and drops his gun--
                                 JOHNNIE LAMB
                        Son of a bidsh you broge ma’ node!

                                 MARTY
                        Looks like an improvement to me.

           INT.  WAREHOUSE BREWERY - LATER

           Ness oversees the aftermath proudly: Robsky loads the Workers 
           and Mobsters (including a sulking Johnnie Lamb) into the back 
           of the Raid Truck.  Leeson gathers clipboards and papers,  
           Gardner DUMPS beer down a drain in the floor. And Marty...

           Is carrying a CASE OF BEER BOTTLES to the cab of the Raid 
           Truck.  Ness clears his throat and he looks up.

                                 MARTY
                        Evidence.

           Ness walks over to him disapprovingly, leans close...

                                 NESS
                            (quietly)
                        Make sure you grab two cases.

           Marty WINKS, you got it, Chief.

           INT.  LAWRY’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The quintessential Chicago steakhouse with leather booths and 
           big steak knives.  Ness and the Team laugh it up at a table 
           towards the back -- not exactly the prime seating, but they 
           don’t seem to mind.

           They’re having so much fun that Ness is the only one who 
           notices as a LARGE PARTY enters the restaurant -- an 
           entourage of sharp dressed MEN in Pearl Gray Hats...

                                 NESS
                        Son of a bitch.

           The whole team turns around and sees...

           Al Capone.  The MAITRE’D fawns all over him, shakes his hand 
           profusely as he ushers him to the prime table in the middle 
           of the restaurant.  As they take their seats Marty sees...

           Johnnie Lamb, nose bandaged in white gauze, two black eyes.

                                 MARTY
                        How’d he make bail already?
                                 GARDNER
                        Capone owns the courts.  They 
                        probably never even saw a judge.

           Ness keeps his eyes on Capone... which doesn’t escape Frank 
           Nitti, sitting to Capone’s right.  Nitti leans over and 
           whispers something to Capone, who promptly stands up...

           And walks right to Ness’s table.

                                 CAPONE
                        Good evening, gentlemen.  What are 
                        we celebrating?

           His voice has the labored tongue of hours of voice lessons... 
           but he still sounds like a thug.  Uneasy moment, none of the 
           guys move a muscle...

                                 NESS
                        Just here for a good meal.

                                 CAPONE
                        Don’t be so modest, Mr. Ness.  I 
                        hear you boys had a big night.

           If Ness is unnerved that Capone knows his name, he doesn’t 
           show it.  Locks eyes with Capone fearlessly.

                                 NESS
                        We’ll have bigger.  You can count 
                        on it.  Mr. Capone.

           Capone looks back at Johnnie Lamb -- who is locked in a 
           vicious starring contest with Marty.  When he looks Back Ness 
           is still starring at him.  Capone smiles graciously.

                                 CAPONE
                        Well, since you’re celebrating, let 
                        me buy you boys a round.
                            (winks at Ness)
                        Just kidding, of course.

           Capone heads back to his table.  Ness never takes his eyes 
           off him as he settles back into his seat.

                                 NESS
                        I want to get a wiretap on him.

           They guys all exchange looks.

                                 GARDNER
                        We’ll never get one at the 
                        Lexington -- security’s too tight.
                                 NESS
                        He’s got to be vulnerable 
                        someplace.  Let’s find it.

           Ness finally drops his stare... but Capone sneaks another 
           look back at him, then leans in close to Nitti.

                                 CAPONE
                            (ominously)
                        I want you to take care of Ness.

           Nitti just nods, jots something in his little black book.

           EXT.  ADDISON STREET - MORNING

           Ness exits a diner with two paper cups of coffee, crosses the 
           street to his car.  Marty is waiting inside.

           TWENTY YARDS BACK an ominous BLACK SEDAN starts its engine.  
           Can’t see the faces of the MEN inside, just PEARL GRAY HATS.

           NESS climbs into the drive’s seat, barely keeps the coffee 
           from spilling. As he closes his door--

           THE SEDAN guns its engine, peels out into traffic straight 
           toward Ness’s car -- passes within feet and -- an ARM HURLS 
           something GREEN through Ness’s window -- looks like a GRENADE-

                                 MARTY
                        Get down! 

           Coffee goes flying -- they ROLL out of the car, hit the 
           pavement, cover their heads and brace for the explosion... 

           ... But nothing happens.  After a moment Ness looks up...

                                 NESS
                        Marty?

                                 MARTY (O.S.)
                        I’m hit.

           Ness peers around the car, sees Marty lying on the pavement, 
           COVERED in coffee.  Then Ness sees the GREEN OBJECT lying by 
           the pedals... not a grenade but a rolled wad of $20 BILLS.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Looks like somebody wants to pay 
                        for your coffee, Chief.

           Ness grits his teeth, cranes his neck to see -- the Black 
           Sedan is visible down the street.
           FURY -- Ness jumps in the car and SLAMS the door shut, GUNS 
           the engine -- Marty barely gets in before Ness PEELS out--

           Ness weaves in and out of lanes, around cars, hellbent on 
           catching the Black Sedan.  Marty holds on tight, looks pale.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Uh... I think we’re speeding.

           Ness swerves around another car and gets right behind the 
           Sedan.  NOW the Sedan DRIVER notices -- accelerates right for 
           a 4-way intersection -- hits it as the light turns RED--

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Chief!

           Ness ignores the light, slingshots around the Sedan -- SLAMS 
           on his breaks and CUTS OFF the Sedan dead in the middle of 
           the intersection.  HORNS BLARE as traffic in every direction 
           is brought to a stand-still.  

           Marty exhales a sigh of relief -- Ness, jaw-clenched, gets 
           out of the car and  YANKS open the Sedan’s door and PULLS the 
           DRIVER onto the street.  The PASSENGER makes a move but -- 
           CLICK -- turns to see Marty aiming a pistol at him.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Relax.  He just wants to give him 
                        some change.

           Ness stands over the Driver, who cowers on the pavement.

                                 NESS
                        You think you can bribe me?

           A CROWD is gathering all around.  Ness pulls out the wad of 
           bills and THROWS it down at the Driver -- the wad BOUNCES 
           hard off his skull with a THWACK!

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        You tell Capone, you tell your 
                        friends, you tell everybody -- I 
                        can’t be bought!
                            (puts a foot on his chest)
                        You understand?

           The Driver manages a nod.  Ness lets up.  Marty winks at the 
           petrified Passenger... then notices a paper cup of COFFEE in 
           his trembling hands.

           Ness walks back to the car -- FLASH!  He turns to see a 
           PHOTOGRAPHER with a camera pointed at him.  Ness gets into 
           the car and sees Marty sipping the Passenger’s Coffee with a 
           satisfied grin on his face.
                                 MARTY
                        That was fun.

           EXT.  LINCOLN PARK - DAY

           CLOSE ON: Newspaper,front page, the picture of Ness... 
           standing on the running boards of his car, defiantly elevated 
           above the Mobsters, looking every bit the All-American Hero.

           Alexander Jaime looks at the headline with consternation.  
           Ness smirks, enjoying this immensely.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        This doesn’t help.

                                 NESS
                        They’re gonna’ see my face when I 
                        kick down the door anyway.  What’s 
                        the harm?

           As if on cue two PRETTY GIRLS walk by, EYEING NESS.  Ness 
           smiles at them, winks -- they giggle.  Jaime is not amused.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        It makes you a target.

           Jaime throws the newspaper in a trash can.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I want you to get a bodyguard.
                            (before Ness can protest)
                        This one isn’t negotiable.  Call 
                        him you driver, call him your damn 
                        valet for all I care -- just get 
                        one you can trust.

                                 NESS
                        Is this coming from my boss, or my 
                        sister’s husband?

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        If it were coming from your 
                        sister’s husband it wouldn’t have 
                        been nearly as civil.

           EXT.  FRANK BASILE’S “HOUSE” - DAY

           A rundown building that once passed for a house, now 
           subdivided four ways into a quadplex.  Ness climbs a rickety 
           wooden staircase to the second floor “landing” and door.  
           From within CHILDREN playing is audible.  He knocks.
           The door cracks open.  The eyes of MARY BASILE peer out.  If 
           her eyes are any indication, and they are, Mary is a hard, 
           tough, strong woman.  Lived through hell and back.  And 
           judging by the way she looks at Ness, he may have been 
           responsible for the hell.

                                 NESS
                        Hi Mary, I’m here to see Frank--

                                 MARY BASILE
                        He ain’t here.  And I’d appreciate 
                        if you don’t come ‘round again.

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        Mary, it’s all right.  Let him in.

           Mary glares a moment longer, then opens the door.

           INT.  FRANK BASILE’S “HOUSE” - CONTINUOUS

           Barely an apartment.  One large room with a woodfire stove in 
           one corner, a mattress in the other.  Two CHILDREN play on 
           the floor.  Mary steps aside so Ness can come in.  He 
           politely removes his hat, then smiles warmly as he sees...

                                 NESS
                        Frank.

           FRANK BASILE.  29, a mountain, a bear of a man with a scruffy 
           beard and big, gentle-doughy eyes.  He gets up and takes Ness 
           hat, doesn’t have a hook to hang it on so he just holds it.

                                 FRANK
                        Good to see you, Mr. Ness.
                        Can I get you some coffee?  Mary, 
                        put some coffee on for Mr. Ness.

           By the look in her eyes coffee is a luxury they can’t afford.

                                 NESS
                        No, that’s okay, Frank.  Anymore 
                        coffee today and my back teeth will 
                        be floating, know what I mean?

           Frank motions for Ness to sit down in one of the two 
           mismatched chairs in the corner.  Before Ness can speak the 
           Little Boy, a cute 5 year-old, climbs into Frank’s lap.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        I want you to come work for me.

           Mary’s eyes FLARE -- Frank makes eye contact with her, tries 
           to pacify her.  Ness senses the tension...
                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        I need a driver.  I put my car into 
                        a fire hydrant and now they don’t 
                        want me driving city property.

                                 FRANK
                        You want me to drive you?

                                 NESS
                        Just drive.

           He says it more for Mary’s benefit than Frank’s.

                                 FRANK
                        I’d love to, but... are you sure 
                        the police will let you hire me?
                        It’s just, I figure with my record-

                                 NESS
                        Not a problem.   Be at the Old 
                        Transportation Building tomorrow 
                        morning.  I’ll leave my car out 
                        front.

                                 FRANK
                        Aw no, Mr. Ness -- I can walk down 
                        there -- you shouldn’t.

                                 NESS
                        I need the exercise.  

           Ness gets up, matter settled, and takes his hat.  He gives 
           the Boy a tussle on the head, then nods politely to Mary and 
           lets himself out.

           EXT.  COMISKEY PARK - DAY

           The cheap seats.  Filled with hooky-playing school boys.  
           Ness and Marty share a bag of crackerjacks, trade a pair of 
           binoculars back and forth.

                                 MARTY
                        This was better when they sold 
                        beer.

                                 NESS
                        You were sixteen last time they 
                        sold beer here.

                                 MARTY
                        Fifteen.  My old man bought me one.  
                        Taught me how to bet, too.
                                 NESS
                        After we nail Capone we’ll have to 
                        start another task force just to 
                        curtail your gambling.

                                 MARTY
                            (a moment, then...)
                        So... Frank Basile.  That’s an 
                        interesting choice.

                                 NESS
                        You wouldn’t bring it up if you 
                        didn’t have an opinion.

                                 MARTY
                        I just wonder if he’s the right man 
                        for the job.

           Ness looks slightly peeved.

                                 NESS
                        The man did his time.  Left two 
                        kids and a wife and paid his debt.

                                 MARTY
                        Don’t make it sound so righteous -- 
                        he threw two guys off a roof--

                                 NESS
                            (temper rises)
                        Two guys who were coming to kill 
                        him and his family--

                                 MARTY
                        That’s what happens when you’re 
                        mixed up with the Mob--

                                 NESS
                        Well he wouldn’t have been mixed up 
                        if I hadn’t--

           Ness stops, realizes he just walked into Marty’s trap.

                                 MARTY
                        Funny thing about guilt.  It 
                        masquerades as so many things.

                                 NESS
                        This isn’t guilt.  I trust him.

                                 MARTY
                        Five years of prison can leave a 
                        man with an awful lot of debt.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARTY (CONT'D)
                        He’s got two kids and a wife... 
                        How’s supporting himself?

                                 NESS
                        Certainly not by selling me out.

           Marty just nods, not sold at all.  And for the briefest 
           moment Ness isn’t either... but then -- the CROWD near home 
           plate comes to life.  Marty looks through the binoculars.

                                 MARTY
                        You’re not gonna’ believe this...

           BINOCULAR POV: Al Capone and his entourage make their way to 
           the seats RIGHT BEHIND home plate while the crowd applauds 
           him wildly.  He waves like a politician.  Like royalty.

           Ness scowls... but is it Capone, or the adoration?

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ness sits at his desk as Marty and Robsky enter.  Marty opens 
           his mouth to speak when the phone RINGS.  Ness holds up a 
           finger, give me a sec.

                                 NESS
                        This is Ness.

                                 SINISTER VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        We’re gonna’ gun you down in the 
                        street like a dog, you piece of--

                                 NESS
                            (could care less)
                        That’s great, I look forward to it.
                            (hangs up)
                        Getting those twice a day now.  
                        What’s up?

           Marty looks to Robsky, who shuffles his feet nervously.

                                 ROBSKY
                        The wiretap...

           Robsky is interrupted again as Frank Basile enters -- sharply 
           shaven, hair combed, wearing a threadbare suit.  Marty eyes 
           him carefully.

                                 NESS
                        You were saying?
                                 ROBSKY
                        I want... to wiretap the Montmartre 
                        Cafe...

                                 MARTY
                        Capone’s brother Ralph runs it.  
                        From everything I gather, he’s got 
                        a big mouth.

                                 FRANK
                            (nervously)
                        That’s true.  He likes to brag.  
                        And back when... well, they used to 
                        handle orders from his office.

                                 NESS
                        I’m sold.  Let’s do it.

           Robsky looks even more hesitant now.

                                 ROBSKY
                        It’s not that easy.  See, there’s 
                        two places to tap a phone.  On the 
                        phone itself, or where the line 
                        connects to the grid -- like a 
                        junction box on a telephone pole...

           EXT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - DAY

           A happening joint even in the sunlight.  Bright red awning 
           and a glowing sign out front.  Fancy cars come and go,  
           Mobsters in Pearl Gray Hats are everywhere -- constantly in 
           and out of the Cafe as well as standing guard all around it.

                                 ROBSKY (V.O.)
                        The place is a fortress -- and 
                        besides the dozen guys guarding the 
                        front and back, there’s always 
                        customers coming and going.  We’d 
                        never get access to a phone inside 
                        long enough to tap it.

                                 NESS (V.O.)
                        So we tap the line outside.

           ZOOM AROUND the Montmartre and into the ALLEY behind it -- 
           dumpsters, trash cans, TWO MOBSTERS guarding the BACK DOOR... 
           and a TELEPHONE POLE rising above the building.

           ZOOM UP the telephone pole to a JUNCTION BOX -- about the 
           size of a briefcase, at the top of the pole.
                                 ROBSKY (V.O.)
                        But it’s not that simple.  Assuming 
                        we can get up that pole without 
                        being seen, the Montmartre still 
                        has at least 6 phone lines that I 
                        could count, and all lead into the 
                        junction box... along with every 
                        other line in the neighborhood.

                                 NESS (V.O.)
                        How many is that?

                                 ROBSKY (V.O.)
                        Probably 20.

           LOOK INSIDE THE BOX: looks like 20 circuit breakers, each 
           with a wire snaking into it.

           INT.  NESS’S CAR - DAY

           Parked in an alley, Ness, Robsky and Frank watch the 
           Montmartre.  Robsky finishes pointing to the TELEPHONE POLE.

                                 ROBSKY
                        But there’s no way to know which 
                        line to tap just by looking at 
                        them.  I need to hear somebody’s 
                        voice -- preferably somebody that I 
                        can recognize, to know I have the 
                        right line.

           Finally Ness has the same thwarted look as Robsky.

                                 NESS
                        So one of us needs to go undercover 
                        in the Mob’s favorite hang out, 
                        talk his way into using their 
                        phone, and stay on the line long 
                        enough for you to tap it.

                                 ROBSKY
                        And who’s gonna’ do that?

           Just then Marty gets in the car, all cheshire smiles.

                                 MARTY
                        I rented us a second floor room at 
                        the boarding house up the street.  
                        Perfect view of the Cafe.
                            (smirks)
                        It’s under the name Fred Pabst.

           Ness, Robsky and Frank all look at each other, then Marty.
                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        What?

           INT.  LISTENING POST APARTMENT - EVENING

           Peeling wall paper, soiled carpet, single bed in the 
           corner... but the ONE WINDOW has a perfect view of the 
           Montmartre down the street.  The Team barely fits inside the 
           small room as...

           Marty walks out of the bathroom COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED.  His 
           hair is dyed bright blonde, combed differently, and he wears 
           a flashy new suit and god-awful wingtip shoes.  It only takes 
           a second for the room to burst in LAUGHTER.

                                 MARTY
                        Laugh it up, you animals.  But you 
                        can’t deny it... I look good.

                                 LEESON
                        You look like a color blind pimp.

                                 MARTY
                            (to Ness)
                        I get reimbursed for this, right?

                                 NESS
                        For that monstrosity?  Hell no -- 
                        I’d be way to embarrassed to ask--

           The laughter explodes all over again.

           INT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - LATER

           Everything a Mob hangout should be.  Red leather booths, lots 
           of hardwood, gaudy gold-gilded bar.  Packed with Mobsters.

           Marty enters and is immediately frisked by two ENORMOUS 
           BOUNCERS.  His trademark grin is gone, his eyes dart all 
           over.  Sensory overload, he doesn’t see the MAN walking 
           toward him and -- BUMPS INTO HIM.

                                 MARTY
                        ‘Scuse me...

           And he turns to see that he bumped into...

           JOHNNIE LAMB.  Nose still bandaged, starring death at him 
           through blackened eyes.  Oh shit...
           EXT.  BETTY’S HOUSE - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT

           Betty and Ness linger on the front step.  Betty looks into 
           Ness’s eyes, and he steps closer and puts his arms around 
           her.  She squirms slightly as he leans in...

                                 BETTY
                        No, Eliot, not here.

           Ness kisses her behind her ear playfully.

                                 NESS
                        Hey, how about we go dancing?  Like 
                        when we were in college.

                                 BETTY
                        When?

                                 NESS
                        Right now-- 

                                 BETTY
                        Now?  Eliot, it’s late--

           But Ness is keyed up, excited like a teenager--

                                 NESS
                        C’mon, I know this place downtown 
                        with a great band and--

           He kisses her again but she puts her hand on his lips.

                                 BETTY
                        Downtown?  You mean it isn’t above 
                        board.

           Ness shrugs, feigns innocence... then sees the harsh 
           disapproval in her eyes.  Ness doesn’t hide his 
           disappointment.  He lets go of her, turns to leave.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        Dinner this Saturday?

                                 NESS
                        Working.

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Ness enters, hangs up his hat and coat, then turns on the 
           light switch and -- GROAN.  Ness almost jumps out of his skin 
           as he sees a BODY lying on his couch--
           It’s MARTY.  HUNGOVER.  Suit wrinkled to hell, jacket balled 
           up as a pillow.  Covers his grizzled face with his hands.

                                 NESS
                        What the hell happened to you?

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - LATER

           Marty, now sitting up with a cup of coffee, doesn’t look much 
           better.  The Team sits all around, trying not to laugh.

                                 MARTY
                        So I go in there last night...

           INT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - LAST NIGHT

           Marty comes face to face with the Johnnie Lamb... Marty 
           freezes, oh shit, I’m done... But Lamb just PUSHES PAST HIM.  
           Doesn’t recognize him.  Marty lets out a huge sigh.

                                 MARTY (V.O.)
                        I blend in, play it pretty cool.

           Bullshit.  He’s sweating bullets as he finds a seat at the 
           end of the bar, starts scanning faces, finds...

           RALPH CAPONE.  At 35 he’s a doughy, balding copy of his 
           younger brother.  Wearing a loud shirt and tie, he stands 
           behind the bar holding court.  What he lacks in his brother’s 
           charm he makes up for in bluster.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        And it’s not hard to find Ralph.

           A BARTENDER taps Ralph on the shoulder, whispers in his ear.  
           Ralph nods and pushes through a curtain behind the bar -- the 
           curtain hangs open so Marty can see...

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        He has an office behind the bar...

           RALPH’S OFFICE -- gaudier than the bar with plush furniture 
           and a huge hardwood desk... with a PHONE on it.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        With a private phone.  And I must 
                        have seen him on that phone two 
                        dozen times.

           TIME LAPSE as Ralph and the Bartender repeat their routine 
           over and over: Tap, whisper, Ralph answers the phone. 
           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 ROBSKY
                        But we still need somebody inside--

                                 MARTY
                        Guys... I’m not finished yet.

           INT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - LAST NIGHT

                                 MARTY (V.O.)
                        So I’m at the bar, making friends.

           Bullshit.  He’s still sitting alone, only now he’s on his 
           fourth or fifth scotch.

                                 MARTY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And it turns out ‘ol Ralph is a 
                        gambler, so I strike up a 
                        conversation with him...

                                 RALPH CAPONE
                        Sox are gonna’ cream the Yanks.  
                        I’m puttin’ two grand on it.

                                 MARTY
                            (without thinking)
                        Kiss that two grand goodbye.

           The place comes to a screeching halt.  Judging by the look on 
           everybody’s face NOBODY talks to Ralph that way.

                                 RALPH CAPONE
                        What’d you say, pal?

                                 MARTY
                        Hinkley’s pitching for the Sox 
                        tomorrow, and Babe’s got a lifetime 
                        batting average of .578 against 
                        him.  He’s gonna’ light ‘em up.

                                 RALPH CAPONE
                            (a moment, then...)
                        So... you’d bet the Yanks?

                                 MARTY (V.O.)
                        And another thing about Ralph?  He 
                        ain’t too good with numbers...

           INT.  RALPH CAPONE’S OFFICE - LAST NIGHT

           Marty sits at Ralph’s desk, feet up, talking on the phone.
                                 MARTY
                        That’s two grand on the Yanks.  And 
                        what’s the action on the Giants?

           Ralph Capone stands behind him looking VERY pleased.

                                 MARTY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        So now I’m allowed on that phone 
                        anytime I want to place bets.

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The Team looks stunned... then... they just explode with 
           laughter and applause -- lots of slaps on Marty’s back (to 
           the chagrin of his hangover headache).

           INT.  LISTENING POST APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ness watches the Montmartre through the rain streaks window.  
           Robsky sits anxiously on the bed, knees bouncing, holding a 
           large SATCHEL.  Leeson, Gardner and Frank lean against the 
           walls, equally unsuccessful at quelling their nerves.

           The phone RINGS.  Ness answers it quickly.

                                 NESS
                        Ready?

           INT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - RALPH’S OFFICE - SAME

           Marty looks over his shoulder as he talks.

                                 MARTY
                        Let’s get this show on the road.

           INT.  LISTENING POST APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                                 NESS
                        We’re on our way.  Now remember, 
                        you have to keep talking or else--

                                 MARTY (OVER PHONE)
                        I know.  Just hurry.  There’s only 
                        so many bets I can place.

           Ness sets the receiver ON THE TABLE doesn’t hang it up.
           EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           The Team splits into two groups as they exit -- Leeson and 
           Gardner go one way, Ness and Robsky the other... Frank makes 
           to follow Ness, but Ness stops him.

                                 NESS
                        Need you to hang back, Frank.  Less 
                        people, the better.
                            (before he can argue)
                        Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.

           EXT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - FRONT - MOMENTS LATER

           A mess of cars constantly stopping to let out MOBSTERS and 
           their SHOWGIRL dates.  Trenchcoated GUARDS direct traffic.  A 
           white CADILLAC pulls up, opens its door and--

           WHAM!  The Caddy is rear-ended by a FORD.  The Caddy’s DRIVER 
           jumps out and starts hollering -- the Ford’s doors open... 
           and LEESON gets out, also screaming.

                                 LEESON
                        What the hell’s he matter with you?

                                 CADDY DRIVER
                        You moron, you hit me!

           Now GARDNER gets out of the passenger seat -- his size adds a 
           whole new dimension to the altercation.  INSTANT CHAOS.  
           Guards wade in, lots of yelling, gridlock on the street.  A 
           perfect ruse.

           EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND THE MONTMARTRE - SAME

           A lone light illuminates the BACK DOOR of the Montmartre.  
           Two GUARDS patrol the alley... when they suddenly hear the 
           yelling from around the corner.  They exchange looks, then 
           take off to check it out.

           As soon as they are out of sight Ness and Robsky scurry into 
           the alley from the other end.

           Ness crouches by a trash can with his .45, keeps watch as 
           Robsky quickly straps a pair of CLIMBING SPIKES to his shoes. 
           Sha-CHINK.  Sha-CHINK.  He starts climbing, one foot at a 
           time.  Ness winches as the spikes cleave into the pole.

           Finally Robsky reaches the top -- Ness looks up at him... 
           he’s a sitting duck up there.
           Robsky opens the box at the top of the pole and...                                                  
           Oh shit.  Inside the box there are at least 50 leads.

           He takes a deep breath, then touches a pair of wires to the 
           first lead, listening on headphones...

           As he works, FOCUS on a lead toward the bottom... just know 
           that is the MAGIC LEAD.

           NESS stays crouched behind the trash can, then FREEZES as -- 
           HEADLIGHTS bounce off the alley walls -- Ness draws back into 
           the shadows as TWO CARS rumble into the alley.

           ROBSKY freezes, pulls himself against the pole as the CARS 
           stop beneath it.  All the doors open in perfect unison as 8 
           BODYGUARDS get out, holding Tommy Guns.

           NESS doesn’t move... through a narrow crack between garbage 
           cans he watches a MAN in a GRAY COAT get out of the second 
           car and quickly enter the back door.  The Bodyguards REMAIN.

           ROBSKY sneaks a look down... one of the Bodyguards is 
           directly below him.  He takes a breath, then GENTLY continues 
           trying the leads... only a few away from the Magic Lead...

           INT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - RALPH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Ralph YANKS the phone away from Marty.

                                 RALPH CAPONE
                        C’mon, somebody I want you to meet.  

           Ralph pulls Marty out of the room -- Marty glances back at 
           the phone as they go...

           EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND THE MONTMARTRE - CONTINUOUS

           ROBSKY touches the Magic Lead... and gets nothing (since 
           Marty isn’t there).  He keeps going.

           DOWN BELOW... the Bodyguard at the rear takes a few steps 
           down the alley... and SOMETHING catches his attention...

           NESS watches from his hiding spot as the Bodyguard walks 
           RIGHT TOWARD HIM.  Only 10 feet away.

           INT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           A LARGE CROWD has gathered around SOMEBODY.  Ralph pulls 
           Marty by the elbow, pushes everybody aside to reveal...
           AL CAPONE.  Grinning and glad-handing like a politician.  
           Ralph SHOVES Marty nose to nose with Capone.

                                 RALPH CAPONE
                        This is the guy I was tellin’ you 
                        about, Snorky.

           Capone smiles, charming, SHAKES Marty’s hand like a ton of 
           bricks.  Marty forces a smile, looks like he may throw up.

           EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND THE MONTMARTRE - CONTINUOUS

           The Bodyguard is 5 feet from Ness and still walking.  Ness 
           puts his finger on the trigger of his .45.  4 feet...

           The Bodyguard puts a second hand on his Tommy Gun.  3 feet...

           The Bodyguard suddenly LOOKS UP -- all of them turn to see:

           FRANK BASILE marching down the alley.  He looks mad as 
           hell... and with his size that’s a scary sight.  

           He stomps right up to the Bodyguard.  Whatever he’s saying 
           must scare the crap out of the Bodyguard because motions for 
           the others to get back in the cars.  Frank watches as the 
           cars pulls out of the alley.  

           After a moment NESS comes out of hiding.

                                 NESS
                        I didn’t know you spoke Italian.  
                        What’d you tell him?

                                 FRANK
                        It doesn’t translate very politely.

           INT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - RALPH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Marty slinks back inside, picks the phone back up.

                                 MARTY
                        Please, please say you’re done...

           EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND THE MONTMARTRE - CONTINUOUS

           Robsky tries another lead.  Nothing.  Then moves on to the 
           Magic Lead... suddenly his headphones crackle to life with:
                                 MARTY (OVER PHONE)
                        ...’cause I’m running out of 
                        betting lines and...

           Robsky’s eyes GO WIDE.

           EXT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - FRONT - CONTINUOUS

           The chaos has died down.  Leeson and Gardner exchange a look, 
           I hope that was enough time, and then get back in their car.

           EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND THE MONTMARTRE - CONTINUOUS

           Ness helps Robsky pull his Climbing Spikes off just as -- 
           VOICES.  Ness, Robsky and Frank all BOLT for the other end of 
           the alley, barely turning the corner as the Guards appear to 
           resume their post.  None the wiser.

           INT.  LISTENING POST APARTMENT - LATER

           Post-game.  FULL CELEBRATION.  Bottles of confiscated beer 
           are clinked and sipped.  Robsky wires a DEVICE on the desk: 
           there is a small speakerbox attached to a light and toggle 
           switch.  The definition of cutting edge for 1929.

                                 ROBSKY
                        All set.  Now we just wait for them 
                        to make a call.

           Then the door opens and Marty walks in, thoroughly haggard.  
           A beer is thrust into his hand and he drinks it thankfully.

                                 NESS
                        You look like hell.

                                 MARTY
                        You would too if you just spent the 
                        last hour drinking with Al Capone.

           Everybody looks STUNNED.

                                 NESS
                        Capone was there?

                                 MARTY
                        Yeah -- and Ralph made me meet him.  
                        I had to down two whiskey sours 
                        with the man.
                                 LEESON
                            (pause)
                        Was he buying?

           The guys start to snicker but before Marty can retort -- The 
           LIGHT on the desk starts BLINKING RED.  They quiet down as 
           Robsky flips the toggle switch and...

                                 VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        Yeah?

                                 RALPH CAPONE (OVER PHONE)
                        Hey, it’s me.

           Everybody’s on the edge of their seats with anticipation.

                                 RALPH CAPONE (OVER PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        I talked to Snorky tonight...

                                 NESS
                        Snorky?

                                 MARTY
                        Al’s nickname.

                                 RALPH CAPONE (OVER PHONE)
                        We’ve got an important delivery 
                        arriving at the harbor on Monday...

           Ness smiles victoriously as the guys all exchange slaps on 
           the back... and put on their game faces.  Show time.

           EXT.  CHICAGO HARBOR - NIGHT

           The city may sleep, but the harbor is bustling with activity.  
           Ships of all sizes and types dock and depart.  DOCKWORKERS 
           swarm the pier, loading and unloading all manner of goods.

           A long concrete BREAKWATER protects the harbor from the 
           oceanic water of Lake Michigan.  At the end of the breakwater 
           sits the CHICAGO HARBOR LIGHTHOUSE, a white tower sandwiched 
           between two red gable-roofed buildings. 

           EXT.  LIGHTHOUSE CATWALK - CONTINUOUS

           Ness and Marty, for once out of their three piece wool suits, 
           wear dark sweaters and pea coats -- look like Dockhands.  
           They both scan the harbor until...

                                 NESS
                        There.
           He points to a small BOAT that has just cleared the 
           breakwater... a small LIGHT flashes on-off-on from the bow.  
           Ness and Marty watch the harbor until...

           ANOTHER LIGHT mirrors the signal.  But not from the docks... 
           it comes from a deserted, rocky patch of the harbor on the 
           far side.  Ness holds up a pair of binoculars: through the 
           darkness he can just make out the MOUTH of a TUNNEL.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        They’re using the old lake drainage 
                        tunnels.

                                 MARTY
                        Big enough for small boats...

                                 NESS
                        And they run all over the 
                        waterfront.  Let’s go.

           EXT.  NORTH SHORE LINE - LATER

           Ness and the Team traverse the craggy rock piles along the 
           shore.  Treacherous going as water splashes on them, wind 
           whips at them.  They finally come to...

           The TUNNEL MOUTH.  Tucked along the rocks, with a thick ARMY 
           TARP covering the opening.  Ness pulls the tarp gently aside 
           so that he can peer inside...

           INT.  OLD DRAINAGE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           The tunnel is large -- easily 20 feet across and lit by lamps 
           anchored to the brick walls.  A channel of water laps gently 
           at a thin brick walkway along the wall.  

           A WOODEN DOCK has been built at the end of the tunnel, and 
           the boat is moored there.  TWO SMUGGLERS unload small wooden 
           crates onto the dock.

           EXT.  NORTH SHORE LINE - CONTINUOUS

           Ness lets the tarp fall back, turns to the Team.

                                 MARTY
                        What’s the plan?

                                 NESS
                            (mischevious)
                        You know how to swim, right?
           INT.  OLD DRAINAGE TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The Smugglers are almost done unloading as...

           SHHHHCK!  SOMETHING slides out of the darkness along the 
           brick walkway -- it stops right next to a Smuggler’s shoe.  
           He looks down at it... about the size of a hockey puck, 
           cobbled together from a few pieces of metal and--

           BAM!  It EXPLODES with DEAFENING NOISE and BLINDING LIGHT (a 
           flashbang) -- the Smugglers cover their ears and eyes as--

           SPLASH!  Suddenly Ness and Marty EXPLODE out of the water 
           alongside the ship -- GRAB the two Smugglers and PULL them 
           into the water -- WHAM!  WHAM!  Crack them both over the 
           head, out cold.

           Leeson, Robsky and Gardner quickly run in along the narrow 
           brick walkway and drag the unconscious smugglers out of the 
           water and into the ship’s cabin.  Then they help pull Ness 
           and Marty out of the water just as--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What’s taking you guys so long?

           Ness spins around to see A MOBSTER behind them, holding a 
           pistol.  The Team freezes, caught totally off guard.  And 
           then... the Mobster walks casually over to Ness... and picks 
           up a crate and THRUSTS it into Ness’s arms.

                                 MOBSTER
                        C’mon, we don’t got all night.

           INT.  TUNNELS - MOMENTS LATER

           The entire Team, all carrying crates, follows the Mobster 
           through the twists and turns of the tunnels.  Marty comes 
           close alongside Ness and whispers...

                                 MARTY
                        You want us to make Capone’s 
                        deliveries while were at it?

                                 NESS
                        Wait until we find the stash, and 
                        then we surround them.

           Up ahead BRIGHT LIGHT pours through another tunnel mouth.  
           The Team follows the Mobster through the mouth and into...
           INT.  OLD CISTERN - CONTINUOUS

           A SPRAWLING old brick DOME that has been converted into a 
           warehouse.  Hundreds of crates of all sizes are stacked.  At 
           least TWENTY MOBSTERS and WORKERS scurry all around.  There 
           are several DOZEN more tunnel entrances around the dome...

           And Ness and the Team are led right into the middle of it 
           all.  They all stop, momentarily dumbstruck...

                                 MARTY
                            (quietly to Ness)
                        We surround them, huh?

           The Team follows the Mobster through the hedge maze of 
           crates.  The set up is truly staggering -- metal catwalks 
           have been fastened to the walls to form overseer platforms.  
           Lightbulbs hang from the ceiling.

                                 MOBSTER
                        Over here.

           The Mobster points to a MOB FOREMAN jotting notes in a 
           notebook.  Ness and the Team set their crates down at his 
           feet.  The Foreman doesn’t look up, just motions...

                                 FOREMAN
                        Get paid over there.

           Ness and the guys start moving when--

                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                            (to Ness)
                        You stay.

           Everybody hesitates, but Ness nods for them to go -- as they 
           do he leans in close to Marty and whispers...

                                 NESS
                        Tell Gardner I want to use his new 
                        toys.  All of them.

           The foreman looks up at Ness, then nods to the crates.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Open ‘er up.

           Ness pulls out his knife and pries off the lid of the top 
           crate to reveal...

           PINEAPPLE HAND GRENADES.  Ness hides his surprise.  The 
           foreman sets down his notebook and picks one up.  As he does 
           Ness sneaks a look at the Foreman’s notebook -- FILLED with 
           dates, times, places and cargoes.  GOLDMINE of information.
                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                        That guy Ness wants a war, then 
                        that’s what Capone’ll give him.

                                 NESS
                        He’s got no idea what he’s in for.

           The Foreman grins, puts the grenade back and then stuffs the 
           notebook in his coat.  

           Ness heads off into the maze of crates.  After a moment Marty 
           joins him -- their hands BRUSH for a split second -- see that 
           Marty just passed SOMETHING to Ness.  None of the Mobsters 
           around them notice.

                                 MARTY
                        How’d the Sox do last night?

                                 NESS
                        Lost 4-5.

           Marty keeps walking but Ness stops and kneels down, pretends 
           to tie his shoe, then... slips a small DEVICE (what Marty 
           passed him) out of his hand -- looks like an egg timer with 
           silly putty attached to it.  Ness sets the timer for 45 
           SECONDS, sticks it to the nearest crate, then moves on.

           Ness finds a metal staircase and climbs up and onto a catwalk 
           that overlooks the entire room.  He WATCHES as Marty, Robsky, 
           Leeson and Gardner all PLANT their devices around the room.

                                 MOBSTER (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           Ness turns around, sees a Mobster with a Tommy Gun 
           approaching him.

                                 MOBSTER (CONT’D)
                        You ain’t s’posed to be up here.

           Ness just grins, walks casually toward him.

                                 NESS
                        Got something you should see...

           Ness gets right next to him and points out into the room...

                                 MOBSTER
                        What--

           Suddenly FIVE EXPLOSIONS erupt all around the room -- crates 
           SPLINTER throwing wood and glass and booze everywhere--
           WHAM!  Ness PUNCHES the Mobster in the stomach, RIPS the 
           Tommy Gun out of his hands and CLOCKS him--

                                 NESS
                        Federal Agents!  This is a raid!

           The rest of the Team have climbed to similar positions and 
           have guns aimed down at the Mobster and Workers.

           Ness scans the room until his eyes find... the FOREMAN -- and 
           the Foreman sees him looking and panics -- makes a run for it-

           NESS runs along the catwalk, but the Foreman cuts through the 
           crates, zigzagging his way across the room and-- 

           Ness JUMPS off the catwalk and ONTO a crate -- he jumps from 
           crate to crate taking a direct path after the Foreman--

           The Foreman ducks into the nearest tunnel and Ness jumps off 
           his crate and follows after him--

           INT.  RUM TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

           BAM!  BAM!  MUZZLE BLASTS light up the tunnel -- illuminate a 
           SILHOUETTE for a split second -- Ness charges ahead--

           Around a corner and now there is LIGHT visible ahead -- thin 
           shafts, coming from...

           A TRAP DOOR in the ceiling, left haphazardly open.  A small 
           metal ladder leads up to it.  Ness climbs and...

           INT.  SUPPLY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           ...finds himself in a small closet filled with brooms, file 
           boxes and other miscellaneous items -- he gives it only the 
           most cursory look before PUSHING through the only door--

           INT.  POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Ness explodes out of the closet and into a sea of BLUE 
           UNIFORMED COPS, going about their work (yes, a smuggling 
           tunnel led to a police station).  Ness skids to a stop, brief 
           moment of Christ, this city is corrupt, then--

           He SEES the Foreman pushing through the blue uniforms toward 
           the door -- Ness JUMPS onto a desk -- runs and VAULTS from 
           desktop to desktop across the room and then -- TACKLES the 
           Foreman right into a crush of Police officers--
           BAD MOVE -- the Police don’t think twice, just PILE ON NESS, 
           raining fists and blows on their “attacker.”  The Foreman 
           manages to pull free and run out the door--

           Ness wards off the blows, gets his BADGE out and--

                                 NESS
                        I’m -- I’m a Federal Agent--

           They finally let up and Ness runs for the door--

           EXT.  MICHIGAN AVENUE - CONTINUOUS

           Ness hits the sidewalk and catches a glimpse of the Foreman 
           running up the stairs of an L TRAIN PLATFORM-- 

           EXT.  L TRAIN PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

           Ness takes the stairs two at a time, gets there as the Train 
           is leaving the Station -- SEES the Foreman inside--

           Ness jumps ONTO a bench and GRABS the edge of the overhang -- 
           uses his momentum to pull himself up and onto the roof and 
           SPRINTS across the top of it--

           The Train picks up speed as Ness chases after it -- he gains 
           a little ground and just as the Train leaves the platform 
           Ness reaches the end of the roof and -- JUMPS--

           THUD!  Ness lands hard on the roof of the train and BARELY 
           keeps himself from sliding off the side -- he gets a grip and 
           steadies himself, then catches a glimpse of the LONG DROP not 
           just to the tracks but an extra 40 feet to the street-- 

           INT.  L TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           THUMP!  THUMP!  The Foreman hears the sounds from the roof 
           and PULLS his pistol out of his coat -- BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  He 
           fires into the ceiling -- people shriek and scatter--

           EXT.  L TRAIN ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Ness tries his best to hang on as BULLET HOLES punch through 
           the roof all around him--
           INT.  L TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           The Foreman GRABS a fleeing WOMAN and pulls her in tight as a 
           hostage, alternates aiming the gun at her head and the 
           ceiling, eyes darting around frantically--

           CRASH!  Suddenly Ness SWINGS down and EXPLODES through the 
           window behind the Foreman -- gun goes flying, The Foreman 
           loses his grip on the Woman, and he and Ness land hard--

           WHAM!  Ness throws a nasty punch but the Foreman wraps him up 
           -- they grapple, roll -- trade elbows and knees--

           CRACK!  An elbow to Ness’s ribs separates them -- they both 
           get up and come at each other again -- just as the Train 
           slows and pulls into the next station-- 

           WHAM!  Ness connects another punch and sends the Foreman to 
           the ground.  Then the train stops and the DOORS OPEN -- the 
           passengers stampede out -- and in the process scrambling feet 
           KICK THE GUN across the floor and right in front of--

           The Foreman.  He grabs the pistol, swings it up to fire and--

           Ness SPINS and WHIPS a kicks at him -- hits him so hard that 
           he tumbles out the doors and onto the next set of tracks -- 
           and right into the path of an approaching train--

           The Foreman’s eyes go wide as the train barrels down on him--

           Ness FLIES across the tracks and GRABS the Foreman by the 
           collar, PULLS him onto the platform a split second before the 
           train passes.  Close call.

           Ness jams a knee in the Foreman’s back and reaches into his 
           coat... and pulls out the NOTEBOOK.

           INT.  OLD CISTERN - LATER

           The Mobsters are cuffed and lined up as Ness enters through 
           another tunnel, dragging the Foreman with him.  He shoves the 
           Foreman alongside the other prisoners as Marty joins him.

                                 MARTY
                        We should probably tell the cops 
                        about this place.

                                 NESS
                        Some how I think they already know.
                            (hands Marty the notebook)
                        Dates, times, locations of at least 
                        50 more deliveries all over town.
                                 MARTY
                        Not bad.  And we’ve got something 
                        else you should see.

           INT.  TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           At least 30 DELIVERY TRUCKS parked bumper to bumper and side 
           to side.  Gardner stands on the hood of one, no room on the 
           floor to walk.  Ness looks very pleased.

                                 MARTY
                        Looks like a good chunk of Capone’s 
                        fleet.  Want us to take ‘em back to 
                        the garage?

           Ness gets a mischievous look on his face.

                                 NESS
                        Something like that.

           EXT.  LEXINGTON HOTEL - MORNING

           CRACK!  The unmistakable sound of a bat hitting a ball--

           A BASEBALL flies through the air and--

           SMASH!  Breaks a window.  Familiar scene, sure to be 
           accompanied by shrieks and running school boys.  Instead...

           Men CHEERING, hooting.  A dozen Mobsters, shirtsleeves rolled 
           up with baseball mitts, stand around a makeshift baseball 
           diamond in the middle of the street.  They even have real 
           canvas BASES, a pitchers rubber, and a home plate where...

           Al Capone stands, bat in hand, cigar in mouth and -- CRACK!  
           Belts another line shot that bounces off two cars, leaving 
           sizeable DENTS, before it’s fielded by a Mobster.

                                 CAPONE
                        That’s another run.

           Frank Nitti sits in a chair on the sidewalk under an 
           umbrella, daintily keeping score in his black book.  Then--

           HONKING -- Capone swings and misses -- looks furious as a 
           TRUCK turns down the street and into his game.  A moment... 
           then another truck comes around the corner.  Then another...

           A procession of THE CONFISCATED TRUCKS rumble their way 
           through, forcing the Mobsters off the street.  Leeson, Robsky 
           and Gardner drive the first three and WAVE with big grins on 
           their faces as even Capone is forced to step aside.
                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        Those are my trucks... those sons 
                        of bitches -- those are my trucks!

                                 NESS (O.S.)
                        Not any more.

           Capone whirls around to see... Ness standing behind him.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Now they belong to the city of 
                        Chicago.

           Capone’s eyes flash pure white hot fury and he SQUEEZES the 
           bat so hard it could snap -- takes two steps toward Ness and--

           SHICK-SHACK -- standing off to the side is Marty with a 
           SHOTGUN.  Capone stops, hands the bat to Nitti innocently.

                                 CAPONE
                        Real big man, huh?  Gotta’ have 
                        your pal pull a gun on me--

                                 NESS
                        I’m ready when you are, Snorky.  
                        Think I’m scared of you?

           Capone gets nose to nose with Ness.  Testosterone showdown.  
           Two alpha males who won’t back down.  A school yard standoff.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        What -- you scared I’ll embarrass 
                        you in front of your cronies?

           Capone’s eyes are like a viper ready to strike... he WHIPS  
           his hand up and -- Ness doesn’t flinch as -- he picks a piece 
           of lint from Ness’s coat.  He smiles at him.  Somehow... 
           that’s much more unsettling.

                                 CAPONE
                            (loud, for all to hear)
                        Assaulting a federal agent is 5 
                        years in lock-up.
                            (then, quietly)
                        Don’t worry, college boy.  You’ll 
                        get your chance.

           Capone turns around, jerks a thumb back at Ness.

                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        This guy needs to get laid.

           Bodyguards LAUGH as Capone saunters away and into the hotel, 
           taking Ness’s victory with him.
           INT.  LISTENING POST APARTMENT - EVENING

           Ness enters -- Robsky is sitting at the desk, taking notes on 
           a yellow legal pad as a phone call plays out.

                                 NESS
                        Anything good?

                                 ROBSKY
                        They gossip more than school girls.

                                 RALPH CAPONE (OVER PHONE)
                        You bringin’ the blonde by tonight?

                                 VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        Stella?  She should be comin’ by 
                        ‘round eleven.  She bailed on me 
                        last night -- you believe that?  
                        After I bought her that fur coat.

           Robsky gets up, puts on his overcoat as Ness takes his seat.

                                 RALPH CAPONE (OVER PHONE)
                        You oughta’ teach her some manners.

                                 VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        Maybe after I’m done with her 
                        tonight we let some of the other 
                        guys have a go at her.

                                 ROBSKY
                        Poor girl’s in for a rough night.

                                 NESS
                        Well, when you fall in with these 
                        guys... see you tomorrow.

           Robsky leaves and Ness sits back in the chair.

           TIME LAPSE -- Ness moves from the chair to the bed, his tie 
           slackens and his shoes come off.  Pours and repours cups of 
           coffee from a pot in the corner.

                                 RALPH CAPONE (OVER PHONE)
                        ...Snorky keeps a place up in 
                        Michigan under our Mother’s maiden 
                        name, just in case...

           Ness’s eyelids start to drop.  Christ, this is boring.  Goes 
           for the coffee pot -- only dregs left.  Damn.
           EXT.  STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Ness exits a diner with a paper cup of coffee.  Down the 
           street he sees the glow of the Montmartre and smiles.  He 
           heads back for the Apartment building when...

           He passes a WOMAN in a FUR COAT, clacking in high heels 
           straight for the Montmartre.  Ness double takes on her, 
           ponders, then...

                                 NESS
                        I’d steer clear of there tonight, 
                        if I were you.

           The Woman stops, turns around to look at him.

           She is STUNNING.  Maybe 22, a busty beauty with rosy-full 
           lips and blonde hair pouring down over her shoulders, drawing 
           attention to her strapless red dress and plunging neckline... 
           She’s practically spilling out of it.  A pin-up in the flesh.

           This is STELLA.  Ness is breathless.

                                 STELLA
                        What’s it to you?

                                 NESS
                        Just trying to help you out.

                                 STELLA
                        I know you, Mister?

                                 NESS
                        No.  But all the same, tonight’s a 
                        good night to stay home.  Trust me.

           She cocks her head, intrigued.  Last time a handsome young 
           guy called her “Miss” was probably never.  She smiles at him.

                                 STELLA
                            (coyly)
                        But I’m already dressed up?  Ain’t 
                        even had dinner yet.

           INT.  GIN JOINT - LATER

           Dim lighting, small tables that force couples to rub knees.      
           On one side of the room is an empty dance floor and a four 
           piece JAZZ BAND playing a mellow tune.  With her coat off 
           Stella is even more entrancing.
                                 STELLA
                        He’s not really my boyfriend.  He’s 
                        just... a guy to pal around with.

                                 NESS
                        A girl like you shouldn’t pal 
                        around with creeps like that.

                                 STELLA
                        And what kind of girl am I?

           Ness looks deep into her eyes like he’s examining her.

                                 NESS
                        You’re smart... confident... that’s 
                        why you left Indiana.

                                 STELLA
                        How’d you know...

           He winks.  Damn he’s charming.

                                 NESS
                        Came to the big city to get away 
                        from a small town.  Found a crowd 
                        that was always running around, 
                        some guys who could show you a good 
                        time... but you know you deserve 
                        better than cheap motels and late 
                        night phone calls.

                                 STELLA
                            (skeptical)
                        Like flowers and chocolates?

                                 NESS
                        Like someone to tell you that your 
                        smile is the prettiest thing I’ve 
                        ever seen.

           She blushes, has to avert her eyes... but she’s saved as the 
           Jazz Band picks up into a fast paced number.  A few couples 
           get up to dance and Stella suddenly smiles, GRABS Ness’s hand-

                                 STELLA
                        C’mon!

           Ness grins as he and Stella hit the dance floor.  Ness is a 
           hell of a dancer, his athleticism on full display as he and 
           Stella spin all over, powered by excitement and sexuality -- 
           the envy of every other couple.
           INT.  LISTENING POST APARTMENT - LATER

           Ness and Stella burst through the door in a fierce embrace.  
           Ness kicks the door shut as they topple onto the bed--

           Their kisses are desperate -- they fight for position, 
           pushing and grabbing and clawing at each other frantically.  
           Stella is fierce and aggressive as she forces Ness onto his 
           back and takes control.  

           Slowly she absorbs his frenzied energy, channels it into 
           something much more practiced, more passionate... until they 
           are writhing together as one.

           INT.  DINER - EVENING

           The Team is clustered at a booth.  A MAP is spread out 
           amongst blue plate specials, at least two dozen locations are 
           circled all over it.... but there are another dozen circles 
           with big X’s slashed across them.

                                 ROBSKY
                        ..And then they mention two more 
                        breweries on the east side...

                                 NESS
                        That makes... 18.  

           A WAITRESS comes over, starts refilling coffee cups.  She 
           smiles at Robsky, who blushes and looks away.  EVERYBODY 
           notices.  As the waitress leaves...

                                 MARTY
                        Very smooth, Romeo.

           The guys all snicker.  Robsky turns red again.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Here, let me help you.
                            (loudly, to Waitress)
                        Excuse me, miss?  My friend here 
                        has a question for you--

                                 ROBSKY
                        Knock it off--

           The Waitress starts to walk back over when--

           Suddenly all the windows EXPLODE in a HAIL of BULLETS--

           The guys HIT THE GROUND as bullets RAKE the booths and tables 
           and -- the coffee pot SHATTERS in the Waitresses hand -- Ness 
           jumps up and DIVES -- PULLS her to the ground--
           BRRAPPT!  The guys pull their pistols but bullets zip just 
           above their heads and then--

           IT STOPS as suddenly as it began -- outside TIRES SCREECH--

           Ness peers out the busted windows and sees three cars race 
           away -- then he looks back down and sees... the Waitress is 
           dead.  Shot through the chest.  He slumps to the ground.

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - LATER

           The Team is scattered around the office.  Suits ripped and 
           soiled -- for the first time the guys actually look unnerved.  
           The MAP is laid out on the desk.  Ness stares at it.  There 
           are blood stains on it.  Finally...

                                 NESS
                        Anybody wants out, now’s the time.  
                        We’ve hurt them... so they’re 
                        gonna’ come after us.

           Nobody says anything for a long moment.  Then...

                                 MARTY
                        I say we hit the ironworks brewery.

                                 GARDNER
                            (pause)
                        Lot of guys there.

                                 MARTY
                        Maybe I’m spoiling for a fight.

           Slowly... the guys all start to nod.  Hell Yes.

                                 ROBSKY
                        Let’s hit the Southside -- really 
                        take their legs out--

                                 LEESON
                        Trucks are routed through Western 
                        Avenue -- we could hit a convoy--

           The room quickly descends into a shouting match.  Ness 
           doesn’t say anything, just stares at the map...  dozens of 
           circles... After a moment they all turn to him and...

                                 MARTY
                        What do you think, Chief?

                                 NESS
                            (a moment...)
                        Let’s hit all of them.
           INT.  OLD TRANSPORTATION BUILDING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Ness stands of the hood of a car in front of 30 POLICEMEN and 
           PROHIBITION AGENTS.

                                 NESS
                        This will be the largest series of 
                        raids Chicago has ever seen--

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Raids?  You mean more than one?

                                 NESS
                        We have 18 targets.  You will be 
                        divided into five teams, each 
                        headed by one of my Men.

                                 PROHIBITION AGENT
                        What are the targets?

                                 NESS
                        You won’t be told until you are en 
                        route--

           The Crowd RUMBLES with discontent.  Toward the back, a 
           WEASELY LITTLE AGENT slips away from the pack and ducks 
           through a door.

           INT.  HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           At the end of the hall is a wall mounted TELEPHONE.  The 
           Weasel makes right for it when--

                                 MARTY (O.S.)
                        Looking for something?

           The Weasel turns around to see Marty standing in the doorway 
           with his Cheshire grin.

                                 WEASEL
                        No, I uh -- just needed to -- 
                        looking for a... bathroom.

           Marty grins, looks way too happy to accommodate him.

                                 MARTY
                        Me too.
           INT.  BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           There are 6 urinals on the wall, but Marty has chosen to 
           stand RIGHT NEXT TO the Weasel, who looks excruciatingly 
           uncomfortable.  Still grinning, Marty looks down at...

                                 MARTY
                        Say... those are nice shoes.

           INT.  OLD TRANSPORTATION BUILDING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Police and Agents are broken into teams and getting into 
           trucks.  Ness sees Marty almost dragging the Weasel to one.

                                 MARTY
                        This one’s a little nervous -- his 
                        first raid and all.  I figure he 
                        should ride with me.

           INT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Almost completely empty.  A few CRATES along the back wall, 
           and in the middle of the room four MOBSTERS play cards on a 
           table made of barrels -- the only barrels in sight.  

           THUMP!  THUMP!  One of the Mobsters gets up and opens a SLIT 
           on a garage door, peers lazily out, then OPENS the doors.

                                 MOBSTER
                        Pull it over there.

           As the truck rumbles in see that the driver is MARTY (with 
           the Weasel sitting shotgun).  He pulls toward the poker game.  
           The Mobsters look up as the truck stops just inches from 
           their make-shift table.

                                 MOBSTER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, what the hell’s your problem?

           Suddenly the back of the truck opens up and Ness LEAPS out 
           and ONTO the table with a shotgun -- more Police pour out of 
           the truck behind him--

           One of the Mobsters reaches for his gun but -- SHICK-SHACK!  
           Ness puts his shotgun under the Mobster’s chin.

                                 NESS
                        Don’t worry... you can tell ‘em you 
                        put up a fight.
           The Policemen fan out around the warehouse but... there’s 
           just nothing there.  They look skeptically at Ness.  Marty, 
           still dragging the Weasel by the arm, sidles up to him.

                                 MARTY
                        Nothing.  Not a drop.

           Ness notices the Mobsters SMIRKING at him.  Ness walks over 
           to the Leader, scary-calm, gets right in his face. 

                                 NESS
                        Where is it?

                                 LEADER
                        We ain’t got nothing here.  We’re 
                        good, god-fearing folk, officer.  I 
                        personally never touch the stuff.

           The rest of the Mobsters start to laugh.  Ness doesn’t react 
           for a moment, then he casually picks up a poker chip, fingers 
           it, then FLIPS it into the air...

           It hits the ground and ROLLS across the floor...

           Right to a GRATE in the corner.  The chip falls through the 
           grate and then, a moment later... THUD.  Sounds like it hit 
           wood.  Ness grins at the Mobsters.

           INT.  UNDER THE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The grate is pulled away and Ness peers down into a dark 
           space.  Pull back to reveal the poker chip sitting on a 
           BARREL.  Keep pulling back to see more and more barrels.

                                 NESS
                        Jackpot.

           Keep on going -- the underground seems to stretch on forever, 
           and it’s completely FILLED with barrels.

           INT.  LEXINGTON HOTEL - CAPONE’S SUITE - NIGHT

           Capone is eerily calm as he sits in a highbacked leather 
           chair, a cigar smoldering in his fingers... several inches of 
           ash indicate it has been ignored for some time.

           Scattered on the desk in front of him are various newspapers 
           with pictures of Ness.  Capone stares at the pictures...

                                 CAPONE
                        Do you know what the real danger of 
                        a man like Ness is?
           Frank Nitti, sitting across the room, closes his little black 
           book and looks at Capone.

                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        He’s infectious.  Like a virus.  It 
                        starts with him, but then it 
                        spreads... and soon an entire 
                        business that I have carefully, 
                        painstakingly cultivated withers 
                        and dies on the vine.

                                 FRANK NITTI
                        We can get to him.  I have a man 
                        inside who says he’s vulnerable.

           Finally Capone looks up from the pictures, locks eyes with 
           Nitti.  That scary, icy look of devious determination...

                                 CAPONE
                        That’s not enough anymore.

           INT.  RIVIERA MOVIE THEATER - EVENING

           ON SCREEN: newsreel footage of Ness standing victoriously 
           outside a warehouse as the Team hack open barrels with axes 
           and dump hundreds of gallons of beer into the gutter.

           Ness watches the screen, captivated by his own image.  Betty 
           keeps glancing at his hand... which isn’t anywhere close to 
           hers.  Not even trying.  She looks... disappointed.

           EXT.  RIVIERA MOVIE THEATER - EVENING

           Ness and Betty exit under the bright lights of the marquee.  
           They seem awkward, like a couple on a first date.

                                 BETTY
                        It’s good to see you, Eliot.  
                        Lately I feel like I only see you 
                        on the front page of the paper.

           He smiles, misses the underlying message there... They start 
           to cross the street when their path is suddenly blocked by an 
           elegant black CHAUFFEURED ROLLS ROYCE.

           The rear window rolls down to reveal... NUMBER SIX, smoking a 
           cigar.  He blows smoke out the window and...

                                 NUMBER SIX
                        Enjoy the show, Mr. Ness?
                                 NESS
                            (overcomes his surprise)
                        Yes, sir.  Very much.

                                 NUMBER SIX
                            (notices Betty)
                        And who is this lovely thing?

           Betty looks flustered to be noticed by a Titan like this.

                                 NESS
                        This is Betty Anderson, Sir. 

                                 NUMBER SIX
                        If I had a woman like that waiting 
                        for me at home, I doubt I’d spend 
                        my time running around the city 
                        like you do.

                                 NESS
                        It’s my job, sir.

           Number Six nods, the real reason he’s here...

                                 NUMBER SIX
                        And a damn fine job you’re doing, 
                        Ness.  Damn fine.  You boys keep up 
                        the good work.  And let me know if 
                        you need anything -- anything.  
                        I’ll handle it personally.  
                            (puffs the cigar)
                        When this is done, I believe you 
                        have a bright future in this city.

           And Number Six wraps on the roof with his walking stick and 
           the Rolls glides away down the street.

           INT.  NESS’S CAR - LATER

           Ness drives with a big grin on his face -- thoroughly pleased 
           with himself.  Betty is much more grounded.

                                 NESS
                        I mean, the man owns half of the 
                        waterfront, and he came to see me.
                            (too happy to talk)
                        I’m serious, Betty.  I think five, 
                        maybe six more months and--

                                 BETTY
                        Six months?  Eliot, remember when 
                        you said the whole thing would take 
                        two months, tops?
                                 NESS
                        This isn’t rounding up jaywalkers.

                                 BETTY
                        Don’t you think I know that?  I’m 
                        the one who can’t sleep through the 
                        night, who sits up crying because I 
                        have no idea where you are or if 
                        you’re alive or dead--

                                 NESS
                        It’s my job, Betty.  And you heard 
                        him, ‘when this is done you have a 
                        bright future in this city.’

                                 BETTY
                        Sounds like he already has you 
                        bought and paid for.

           Ness looks like he’s been slapped.  So stunned... he DOESN’T 
           NOTICE two sets of HEADLIGHTS behind the car, following them.

                                 NESS
                        What do you mean by that?

                                 BETTY
                        Wise up, Eliot.  As long as you get 
                        results he’s happy -- but the 
                        second you aren’t useful anymore 
                        he’ll kick you to the curb.

                                 NESS
                        That’s ridiculous--

                                 BETTY
                        What makes him different from 
                        Capone?  He owns the waterfront, 
                        yes, but he also owns slums and 
                        track housing.  The only difference 
                        between him and Capone is that he 
                        went to school with the Mayor.

           Ness turns onto a side street -- and catches something in the 
           rearview -- the Headlights following them.

                                 NESS
                        Don’t be ridiculous -- Capone is a 
                        criminal.  A murderer.

                                 BETTY
                        I just want you to be careful...

           But now Ness isn’t listening -- his eyes on the rearview 
           mirror, watching the Headlights following them.  
           He makes another turn... watches as the Headlights, belonging 
           to a BLUE SEDAN and a RED SEDAN, stay with them.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        ... I don’t want you to get hurt -- 
                        by anybody.

                                 NESS
                        Betty...

           She looks at him, expecting some warm words...

                                 BETTY
                        Yes?

                                 NESS
                        Hang on--

           He SLAMS his foot on the accelerator--

           EXT.  STATE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Ness’s car ROCKETS down the street -- and the Blue and Red 
           Sedans ROAR after it--

           INT.  NESS’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Betty stifles a yelp as Ness CAREENS around a curve.  He 
           keeps one hand on the wheel and reaches into his coat with 
           the other... pulls out his .45.

                                 BETTY
                        Eliot, what’s going on--

                                 NESS
                        Listen to me --  I want you to stay 
                        low, no matter what.  If you hear 
                        gunshots I want you to get on the 
                        floor.  Do you understand?

           Betty manages a terrified nod.  Ness reaches into his coat 
           and pulls out TWO SPARE AMMO CLIPS... hands them to Betty.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        I can’t reload while I’m driving, 
                        so I’ll need you to do it.

           WHAM!  The Red Sedan SLAMS against the back bumper -- then 
           pulls alongside Betty’s window -- Ness can now see three 
           MOBSTERS inside, Tommy Guns up and--
                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Get down!

           Betty gets on the floor as -- BAM!  BAM!  Ness fires straight 
           through her window into the side of the Red Sedan -- forces 
           the Driver to back off--

           WHAM!  Ness and Betty are shaken as the Blue Sedan RAMS into 
           the back of the car -- the car fishtails, Ness fights for 
           control and--

           MACHINE GUN FIRE -- the rear window BLOWS OUT, glass goes 
           everywhere -- Betty screams and covers her head -- Ness sees 
           the Red Sedan veering back towards them and--

           Ness JERKS the wheel, turns the car HARD LEFT and into an 
           ALLEY -- The Blue Sedan shoots right past them, but the Red 
           Sedan manages to SWERVE and follow into the alley--

           EXT.  ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           TIGHT.  Barely enough room for the cars to clear the brick 
           walls and -- CLANK!  Ness’s left sideview mirror is SHORN OFF-

           WHAM!  WHAM!  Ness plows through trash cans, sends them UP 
           and OVER the hood of the car -- WHAM!  They hit the Red Sedan 
           in pursuit, SPIDER-WEB the windshield but the Sedan gains--

           BRRAPPT!  Bullets tear through the car -- Ness points his .45 
           over his shoulder and fires wildly -- empties the gun--

                                 NESS
                        Reload!

           He hands the pistol to Betty -- she fumbles with it, 
           terrified -- BRRAPPT!  More machine gun fire -- Ness ducks, 
           but then SEES SOMETHING up ahead -- a metal FIRE ESCAPE 
           clinging to the side of the brick -- stairs and platforms and 
           a heavy wrought-iron RETRACTABLE LADDER on the second floor--

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Gun!

           Betty tries to slide the clip in with shaking hands -- 
           BRRAPPT!  Another volley and Betty drops the clip--

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Betty--

           She grits her teeth, steadies her hands and slides the clip 
           in -- gives it back to Ness and he fires-- 
           BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  SPARKS fly as bullets hit metal and brick 
           and then -- just as they pass beneath it -- he BLOWS the 
           safety bolts off and the ladder RELEASES, falls STRAIGHT DOWN 
           like a hammer and--

           CRUNCH!  IMPALES the Red Sedan like a toothpick through a 
           sandwich.  Ness breathes a sigh of relief as they come out of 
           the alley, looks down at Betty.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           She nods.  Ness is about to respond when he sees -- the Blue 
           Sedan barreling straight at them -- Ness SPINS the wheel--

           EXT.  MICHIGAN AVENUE - CONTINUOUS

           The Blue Sedan CLIPS the front bumper, sends the car into a 
           violent spin across three lanes of traffic -- the Blue Sedan 
           looses control, SKIDS OUT and nearly misses oncoming traffic--

           INT.  NESS’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Ness recovers from the spin -- sees that he is now BEHIND the 
           Blue Sedan.  Tables have turned.  He puts the pedal down, 
           swerves around traffic, GAINS.

           As they get within 30 yards the BACK WINDOW of the Blue Sedan 
           SHATTERS as FLASHES of Tommy Gun fire erupt -- Ness swerves 
           to avoid the storm of bullets, returns fire with his .45 -- 
           BAM!  BAM!  Blows holes in the back of the Sedan.

                                 NESS
                        Take the wheel!

           Betty double takes on Ness -- do what?  But Ness has already 
           OPENED HIS DOOR and stepped onto the running boards--

           She climbs into the driver seat, takes the wheel as Ness 
           let’s go -- he uses the door as a shield -- street racing 
           beneath him at 60 miles per hour -- BRRAPPT!  Another burst 
           of Tommy Gun fire--

           Betty JERKS the wheel instinctively -- Ness LOOSES his 
           footing, barely grabs onto the door to keep himself from 
           falling -- the street NIPS at the toes of his shoes as he 
           pulls himself back up--

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Keep it steady!
                                 BETTY
                        You think I’m not trying?

           BRRAPT!  Betty grits her teeth as bullets shred the front 
           grill of the car--

           Ness aims at the back tire of the Sedan and -- BAM!  BAM!  
           BAM!  The BACK TIRE of the Sedan BLOWS OUT -- the Sedan 
           SWERVES, can’t hold -- FLIPS--

           The Sedan bounces sickeningly like a tin can, denting and 
           coming apart with every impact--

           Betty skids to a halt in the wake of the wreck -- Ness jumps 
           right off the car and hits the ground full sprint -- reaches 
           the Sedan seconds after it comes to a hissing stop.

           Ness peers inside -- CARNAGE.  No seatbelts, no airbags, no 
           crash-testing.  An old-fashioned WRECK.  Two mangled BODIES 
           amidst a twisted mess or metal, glass and leather.

           Ness GRABS the closest body and DRAGS it unceremoniously out 
           of the wreckage, lets it flop like a rag doll -- then rifles 
           through the pockets...

           As he does get a look at the body: wearing a black suit, 
           black tie.  The Man’s face is covered with POCKMARK SCARS.

           Ness comes up with a PIECE OF PAPER.  He looks at it a 
           moment, then...

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - LATER

           Ness SLAMS the piece of paper on the desk for the entire Team 
           to see.  It looks like a LIST.

                                 NESS
                        That’s a complete list of my 
                        whereabouts, and who I’ve been 
                        with.  For the past week.

           Stunned silence from the Team as that sinks in.  Surveillance 
           means organization.  Organization means PROFESSIONALISM.  
           Marty gives Robsky a nudge.

                                 MARTY
                        Show him.

           Robsky sets a yellow legal pad on the desk.

                                 ROBSKY
                        Overheard this tonight.  Ralph 
                        Capone talking to a lieutenant.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROBSKY (CONT'D)
                            (reads)
                        “Snorky’s gonna’ ice that dandy.  
                        Put a bounty on him...”

           INT.  CAPONE’S SUITE - SOME TIME AGO

           Lights are dim.  Nitti sits in the corner as Capone paces in 
           front THREE HITMEN:

           1) A short Hitman with POCKMARK scars all over his face, 
           wearing a black suit, black tie. (recognize him as the man 
           Ness pulled from the car wreck).

           2) A short Hitman built like a TANK.  Bushy eyebrows and a 
           flamboyant suit.

           3) A creepy looking tall and thin Hitman, his flesh is so 
           tight and pale that he looks like a GHOUL.

                                 CAPONE
                        Two hundred grand for Ness.  Dead 
                        or broken.  One hundred for his 
                        associates.  
                            (pause)
                        Family and friends are five hundred 
                        grand.

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Ness and Marty are alone now.  A cold silence sinks in.

                                 NESS
                            (moment, then tries...)
                        I figured you’d at least have a 
                        joke about a hundred grand not 
                        being enough for you.

           Marty just nods, yeah, another time maybe...

                                 MARTY
                        I’m just wondering how they got so 
                        much information on you.  Only a 
                        few people know your whereabouts 
                        like that.  You, me...
                            (pause)
                        Frank.
                            (pause)
                        Where was Frank tonight?

                                 NESS
                        I was on a date with Betty.  I gave 
                        him the night off.
           Ness looks him right in the eye, sharply.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        He had nothing to do with this.

                                 MARTY
                        I hope you’re right.

           INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Ness sits on a bed, talking on the phone to...

                                 NESS
                        I’m sorry, Betty.  It’s just for a 
                        little while.

           INTERCUT with Betty, in her parent’s kitchen.  She looks out 
           the window at two POLICE CARS parked outside.

                                 BETTY
                        I feel like a prisoner.

                                 NESS
                        At least your at home.  Marty’s got 
                        us changing hotel rooms every other 
                        night just to be safe.

                                 BETTY
                        When can I see you again?

                                 NESS
                        I don’t know.
                            (pause)
                        I’ll call you tomorrow night.

           Ness hangs up.

                                 STELLA (O.S.)
                        She sounds upset.

           Ness looks back at Stella, wrapped seductively in bedsheets.

                                 NESS
                        You’d be too if you had police cars 
                        staked out in front of your house.

                                 STELLA
                            (coyly)
                        Well... am I getting any 
                        protection, Mr. Ness?

                                 NESS
                        I think you’re in good hands.
           She starts to giggle as he kisses her and -- KNOCK!  KNOCK!  

                                 MARTY (THROUGH DOOR)
                        Got a minute, Chief?

           Ness jumps out of bed and opens the door halfway -- not 
           enough for Marty to see the bed.  Marty is dressed in his 
           flashy undercover suit, hair dyed and slicked.

                                 NESS
                        Hot date?

                                 MARTY
                        I’ve still got some juice at the 
                        Montmartre.  I was thinking I poke 
                        around a little bit -- maybe find 
                        out who’s in town.

           The a door across the hall opens and Frank sticks his head 
           out protectively--

                                 FRANK
                        You alright, Mr Ness?
                            (then, recognizes...)
                        Oh, sorry, Marty -- didn’t realize 
                        it was you.

           Marty doesn’t acknowledge Frank, just nods to Ness and walks 
           down the hall.

                                 NESS
                        Watch your back.

           Marty gives him a thumbs up and Ness closes the door.  As he 
           turns back he gets a glimpse of BARE SHOULDERS in the bed.

                                 STELLA
                        Done with business for the night?

           Ness climbs into bed with her and they start kissing.  But 
           then Ness stops, looks at her.

                                 NESS
                        Do you have any money?

                                 STELLA
                        How romantic...

                                 NESS
                        No -- I mean... I want you to put 
                        some money away.  Enough for a 
                        train ticket back to Indiana.  In 
                        case things get worse around here.
           She looks at him playfully, leans in to kiss him.

                                 STELLA
                        Nothin’s gonna’ happen to me--

                                 NESS
                        I’m serious.

           She stops... looks almost confused... never experienced this 
           kind of concern, care before.  She’s touched.  A moment, 
           then... she jumps out of bed and digs through her clothes on 
           the floor... comes up with a KEY.

                                 STELLA
                        Here.  
                            (hands it to him)
                        I dunno’ I just thought, maybe... 
                        you could come to my place.  I 
                        could cook you dinner or somethin’.  
                        Like a real girl would.

           She looks embarrassed just saying it.  Ness takes the key, 
           then cradles her face in his hands and kisses her tenderly. 

           INT.  MONTMARTRE CAFE - LATE NIGHT

           Only a few Mobsters still linger in booths with empty 
           glasses.  Marty and Ralph sit at the bar with alone.

                                 MARTY
                        Somethin’ I need to talk to you 
                        about, Ralph.

                                 RALPH CAPONE
                        Shoot.

                                 MARTY
                        See... gamblin’ ain’t my only 
                        business.  And the way I hear it, 
                        there are some long odds in town 
                        that are more suited to my other 
                        talents.  If you catch me. 

                                 RALPH CAPONE
                        Yeah... I catch you.

           A moment, then Ralph gets up, motions for Marty to follow.
           INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - MORNING

           The Team, minus Marty, mills around the center of the lobby. 
           Morning sunshine pours through the floor to ceiling windows 
           as Ness joins them.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll get the car.

           Frank scurries out the front door.

                                 NESS
                        We all set?

                                 LEESON
                        Just waiting on Marty.

                                 NESS
                        He’s on special assignment.

                                 GARDNER
                        Hungover or gambling?

                                 NESS
                        Probably both.

           They laugh as they begin to file out the front door...

           EXT.  STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Beautiful morning.  Light traffic on the streets, a few cars 
           parked along the curb in front of the hotel.  Leeson and 
           Robsky are first out, then Ness...

                                 ROBSKY
                        Where’s Frank?

           And then the whole street turns into HELL.

           The street is FILLED with the MASSIVE CHOMP-CHOMP-CHOMP of 
           HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE -- All the floor to ceiling windows on 
           the front of the hotel BLOW OUT in an explosion of glass.

           The entire Team DIVES for cover as ENORMOUS DIVOTS the size 
           of softballs are taken out of the sidewalk and brickfronts. 

           Ness rolls behind a parked car -- BLAM!  All four tires are 
           blown out and glass rains down on him.  The car ROCKS from 
           the impact of HEAVY bullets against it.  Leeson and Robsky 
           take cover behind another shredded car.  Gardner doesn’t even 
           make it out of the doors, DIVES back inside.
                                 LEESON
                        That sounds like a 50-cal!

           Ness peaks around the car and sees...

           On the SECOND FLOOR of a CORNER BUILDING a window is open... 
           and the BARREL of a Machine Gun sticks out, belching fire--

           INT.  SECOND FLOOR ROOM - SAME

           All the shades drawn, furniture pushed against the walls.  
           SANDBAGS are piled around the only open window as three MEN, 
           lead by the TANK of a HITMAN in his flamboyant suit, work a 
           50 Caliber BROWNING HEAVY MACHINE GUN -- they’ve turned the 
           room into a machine gun nest.  

           And they have a perfect firing position on the front of the 
           hotel below them.

           EXT.  STREET - CONTINUOUS

                                 NESS
                        Corner building, second story!

           Ness pulls back as bullets rake the car again.  The street is 
           being turned into swiss-cheese -- all the while the constant 
           CHOMP-CHOMP-CHOMP of the Browning drolls on.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        He’ll have to reload soon -- when 
                        he does, hit ‘em with everything.  
                        I’ll make a run for the building.

           CHOMP-CHOMP -- it stops.  Ness doesn’t even need to say it --
           Everybody pops up and OPENS FIRE with their pistols -- Ness 
           makes a break for it but--

           CHOMP-CHOMP-CHOMP -- Ness SEES more fire coming from ANOTHER 
           WINDOW across the street -- he DIVES back behind the car--

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Son of a bitch there’s two of ‘em!

                                 ROBSKY
                        We’ll never get out of here without 
                        something heavier.

                                 LEESON
                        Tommy’s are in my trunk!
           Leeson points past Ness -- about 25 yards down the street is 
           Leeson’s car, untouched by the gunfire.  But it’s a long way, 
           too far to run.  But...

           Ness presses against the car as more bullets punch through 
           it, then YANKS open the passenger door.  He crawls onto the 
           floor and WHAM!  Bashes his pistol against the steering 
           column -- WHAM!  Knocks the facing off, exposing WIRES.

           Bullets slice through the car just over his head as he 
           fingers the wires, twists two together and then--

           VROOM!  The ENGINE REVS -- Ness quickly SLAMS his hand on the 
           accelerator and--

           INT.  SECOND FLOOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Three Men watch in disbelief as the swiss-cheese car 
           ROCKETS along the curb... with no driver in sight--

           EXT.  STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Ness’s legs hang out the passenger door -- he steers blindly 
           with one hand on the wheel and then -- WHAM!  He REAR-ENDS 
           Leeson’s car--

           Ness rolls out, gets the trunk of Leeson’s car open -- 
           JACKPOT.  TOMMY GUNS.

           Ness grabs TWO and then COMES UP DUAL-WIELDING -- SPRAYING 
           bullets across the windows -- he takes off running -- races 
           back to Leeson and Robsky -- tosses them the Tommy Guns--

           Leeson and Robsky catch them and come up shooting -- but Ness 
           DOESN’T STOP -- runs across the street to the corner building-

           INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - ENTRWAY - CONTINUOUS

           KICKS the door in.  Eerily quiet, the gunfire sounds like 
           firecrackers outside.  Ness runs up a rickety wooden 
           staircase... finds THREE DOORS, all closed -- HEAR the 
           machine gun fire, but can’t tell where it’s coming from--

           SUDDENLY the first door OPENS -- Ness aims his gun at--

           A quaking CHILD.  Ness exhales.  The child nods to the next 
           door.  Ness nods back, stalks toward the next door--
           BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Ness DUCKS as three huge HOLES are blown 
           in the door -- hear yelling inside, SHOTGUN cocking, clips 
           changing... Ness, lying on the floor, aims his pistol at the 
           wall... tracks with the sound and then...

           BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  Fires three quick shots through the wall --  
           BLAM!  Shotgun blasts erupt through the plaster but Ness is 
           already moving and--

           KICKS the door in and DIVES into the room -- fires mid-air -- 
           BAM!  Takes down the first Mobster, who FIRES WILDLY into the 
           room, taking out the second--

           Ness catches a brief glimpse of the TANK HITMAN as he--

           OPENS FIRE with a Tommy Gun -- Ness dives, rolls, comes up -- 
           BAM! BAM!  BAM!  Three shots to his chest, drops him.  Ness 
           jumps on the Browning and aims at the OTHER WINDOW with the 
           machine gun barrel protruding -- OPENS FIRE--

           INT.  OTHER SECOND FLOOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Machine gun nest and its Operators are ripped apart by 
           the .50-cal rounds.  Game over.

           EXT.  STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Ness exits the apartment building.  The Team still has their 
           weapons at the ready, scanning the street as -- a CAR RACES 
           around the corner, flies right at them -- everybody aims 
           their weapons at it and--

                                 NESS
                        Wait!

           The car slams on it’s brakes -- it’s Frank.  They all run for 
           the car and open the doors.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Get us out of here, Frank.

           INT.  ORNATE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Alexander Jaime is uncharacteristically silent as he leads 
           Ness quickly and solemnly toward the dark oak door.

                                 NESS
                        No words of wisdom this time?

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        None that you’d listen to.
           INT.  ORNATE HOUSE - STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Secret Six are red faced and fuming.

                                 NUMBER ONE
                        We hired you to stop this violence.

                                 NESS
                        We’ve cut off almost half of 
                        Capone’s income.  Did you think he 
                        would go quietly?

                                 NUMBER TWO
                        We expected you to keep it off the 
                        streets--

                                 NESS
                        It was already on the streets -- at 
                        least now we’re fighting back--

                                 NUMBER SIX
                        Enough!
                            (pause)
                        This chaos is unacceptable.

           Ness starts to argue but--

                                 NUMBER SIX (CONT’D)
                        Unacceptable.  If you can’t finish 
                        this business quickly and quietly 
                        then we’ll find somebody who can.
                            (pause)
                        Do we understand each other?

           INT.  HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jaime closes the door as he and Ness exit.  Ness is steaming, 
           so preoccupied that he doesn’t see the MAN waiting just 
           outside the door -- bumps into him-- 

           Ness is forced to stop and look at...

           FRANK WILSON.  Tall and spindly with glasses and tightly 
           pursed lips.  Looks like classic east coast elite with the 
           class rings and yearbooks to prove it.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        Frank, have you met Eliot Ness?

           As Wilson shakes Ness’s hand there is a hint of amusement... 
           like it’s a big joke and Ness is the punchline.
                                 WILSON
                        A pleasure.  I’ve heard so much 
                        about you... in the newsreels.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        They’re waiting for you.

           Wilson nods his head, then enters the room.  Ness watches him 
           go, then turns to Jaime.

                                 NESS
                        Who’s that cold breeze?

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        Another business interest.
                            (pause, then...)
                        Get your head on straight, Eliot.

           INT.  OLD TRANSPORTATION BUILDING GARAGE - DAY

           Ness and the Team, minus Marty, enter.  Ness is in a foul 
           mood as...  there is a GROAN from across the room.  They all 
           look over, see MARTY curled up on the floor.

                                 NESS
                        Marty, I’m in no mood for your 
                        hangovers today--

           But then Ness gets a good look at him -- he’s been BEATEN to 
           a BLOODY PULP.

           Everybody rushes to his side -- his face is an ugly purple-
           red MASH of bruises and abrasions and the once shiny suit is 
           mottled with blood and dirt.  Gardner takes a look at Marty’s 
           right hand...

                                 GARDNER
                        Jesus, all his fingers are broken--

           INT.  EMPTY WAREHOUSE - LAST NIGHT

           CRACK!  Marty stifles a scream as a pair of HANDS snap his 
           ring finger.  Face already bloodied, he’s tied to a chair 
           under a solitary light.  Johnnie Lamb, nose horribly crooked, 
           lets go of the finger and smirks.  Marty spits out a LAUGH.

                                 MARTY
                        ‘So’kay.  I play a lousy piano 
                        anyway--

           CRACK!  Middle finger.  This time Marty screams -- but turns 
           it into another laugh.
                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Looks like my banjo days are over, 
                        though--

           CRACK!  Marty grits his teeth, forces himself not to scream.  
           He looks up at Johnnie Lamb...

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Hey tough guy... what happened to 
                        your nose?

           Johnnie Lamb rears back for a vicious punch but--

                                 CAPONE (O.S.)
                        Stop.

           Capone appears from the shadows, smoking a cigar.

                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        I admire toughness.  But this?
                        This ain’t toughness.  It’s 
                        stupidity.
                            (leans in very close)
                        You should know, we ain’t gonna’ 
                        kill you.  We’re just gonna’ make 
                        you a nice little message for your 
                        buddy Ness.

                                 MARTY
                        Well... if you want... I can help 
                        you spell... all the big words... 
                        Snorky...

           Capone’s eyes FLARE and -- CRUNCH -- he hits Marty like a 
           freight train.  Then he steps back, nods to Johnnie Lamb, who 
           grins maniacally as he steps back over Marty... slips a 
           KNUCKLEDUSTER onto his right hand...

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        What happened... to your nose?

           Johnnie Lamb rears back and--

           INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Ness and the Team stand over Marty’s hospital bed.  Face 
           bandaged, his right hand in a massive CAST.  Through it all 
           he still manages that goofy grin.

                                 MARTY
                        Seriously, fellas... couple of 
                        weeks and I’ll be placing my own 
                        bets again.
           Marty starts coughing raggedly.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Frank, would you mind grabbin’ me 
                        some water?

                                 FRANK
                        Sure, Marty.

           As soon as Frank leaves Marty’s coughing STOPS.  He looks at 
           Ness gravely.

                                 MARTY
                        Only three people knew I was going 
                        in there last night.  You, me... 
                        and Frank.  He saw me dressed up.

                                 NESS
                        Your cover could have been blown 
                        way before that -- they could have 
                        just been waiting for you.

                                 MARTY
                        And the hit?  They get all of you 
                        guys on the street... and Frank’s 
                        not there.  That a coincidence?

                                 GARDNER
                        He’s right, boss.  It adds up.

           Ness looks around at Gardner, Leeson, Robsky... all nodding 
           their heads solemnly, convinced.  And then Frank comes back 
           in holding a paper cup of water.  He helps Marty take a sip.

           Marty keeps his eyes on Ness the whole time.

           INT.  CAR - NIGHT

           Ness sits shotgun as Frank pulls up to the Transportation 
           Building.  Ness opens his door, starts to get out... but 
           Frank doesn’t move. 

                                 NESS
                        You coming, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        Actually, Mr. Ness... I got a favor 
                        to ask.
                            (pause)
                        Tomorrow is my son’s birthday.  He 
                        really wants this rocking horse -- 
                        and the store closes soon so...
           Ness hesitates... then...

                                 NESS
                        Okay, Frank.  Go ahead.

           Frank smiles appreciatively, then drives away.  Ness watches 
           the car go... then scans the street suspiciously... 

           INT.  CAR - NIGHT/SAME

           Leeson drives and Robsky rides shotgun.  Afterwork casual.

                                 ROBSKY
                        ...all I’m saying is she doesn’t 
                        charge me rent, cooks me three 
                        meals a day, and does my laundry.

                                 LEESON
                        You’re mother sounds like quite a 
                        woman... is she aware you aren’t 
                        seven anymore?

                                 ROBSKY
                        So who does your laundry, huh?

           But Robsky isn’t listening anymore -- his eyes are on the 
           rearview mirror... a pair of HEADLIGHTS are following them.  
           They both go instant serious.

                                 ROBSKY (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got company.

           EXT.  STREET - NIGHT/SAME

           Gardner is the only person in sight as he walks down the 
           sidewalk.  CLOP-CLOP-CLOP his leather shoes slap the pavement 
           extra loud when there’s no other sound.  Then...

           TWO MORE SETS of shoes echo behind him.  Gardner sneaks a 
           look over his shoulder... sees two HUGE GUYS following him.  
           He picks up his pace but the guys stay with him.

           INT.  CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Leeson stops at a red light -- the car behind them pulls 
           alongside them.  Robsky pulls out his pistol and...

           The car, driven by an ELDERLY MAN, makes a right turn.  Both 
           Leeson and Robsky exhale...
           EXT.  STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Gardner rounds a corner and quickly ducks into the shadows, 
           pulls out his pistol... the footsteps get louder and louder 
           and then the Two Guys pass right by Gardner, don’t even look 
           for him.  Gardner exhales...

           INT.  CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The light turns green and Leeson pulls forward, relieved.

                                 ROBSKY
                        So like I was saying--

           WHAM!  Suddenly a TRUCK comes out of nowhere and T-BONES the 
           car -- hits it so hard that the car ROLLS over onto its side-

           EXT.  STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Gardner tucks his pistol away, takes a step out of the 
           shadows when -- HANDS reach out of the shadows behind him and  
           pull him into the darkness--

           INT.  CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Leeson and Robsky are bloodied but conscious -- from cracked 
           windows they can see SHOES surrounding the car -- HEAR the 
           cocking of Tommy Guns and -- BRRAPPT!  Bullets rake the car--

           Robsky manages to get his pistol out, fires wildly--

           EXT.  STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Two THUGS PUMMEL Gardner with billy clubs -- Gardner wards 
           off blows with his arms, LASHES out furiously with his fists 
           and fights to get his pistol free--

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - SAME

           Ness sits at his desk going over paperwork... his .45 locked 
           and loaded on the desk.  Ness wipes tired eyes and then...

           FOOTSTEPS.  Slow, careful footsteps from outside the door.  
           Ness quickly shuts off the lights and presses himself against 
           the wall, gun at the ready.

           Slowly the knob turns... the door creaks open.  A few more 
           steps... the intruder is inside now... a SILHOUETTE in a 
           TRENCHCOAT--
           Ness LUNGES -- GRABS the Intruder’s arm, SLAMS him on the 
           desk and puts the gun against his head-- 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Eliot?

           Ness double-takes, jumps back and turns on the lights-- 

           It’s BETTY.  

                                 NESS
                        Betty I’m -- I thought you were --
                        are you alright?

           She turns around, sees the gun still in his hand...  
           Something about it intrigues her.  She nods... almost coyly.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 BETTY
                        I wanted to see you.
                            (pause)
                        I’ve missed you.

                                 NESS
                        Betty, this isn’t the time to--

           Betty GRABS Ness and kisses him fiercely.  Ness struggles at 
           first -- stunned by it -- then Betty leans back seductively 
           on the desk... opens up her trenchcoat to reveal a sexy silk 
           neglige...

                                 BETTY
                        Did you miss me, Eliot?

           There’s a hungry look in her eye as she grabs him, starts 
           pulling at his belt and shirt buttons.  Her breaths are 
           excited and desperate as she kisses him--

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        Tell me you missed me.

                                 NESS
                        I missed you.

           Ness gets into it now -- feverish, clumsy kisses.  Betty rips 
           at his clothes ravenously, then lays back on the desk. 

                                 BETTY
                        Is this what you want, Eliot?  Is 
                        this how you want me?

           But Ness hesitates -- she grabs at him but he resists.
                                 NESS
                        No, Betty... this isn’t right.  
                        This isn’t you...

           He stops, pulls away... and looks at her:  Make-up smeared, 
           half-clothed, perched on top of his desk... she doesn’t look 
           like Betty.  She looks cheap.  She looks tawdry.

           Ness pulls her coat shut.  Her heart looks about to break 
           through her eyes.  He reaches out to touch her cheek and--

           SLAP!  She hits him across the face HARD.  Ness stands there 
           as she storms out.  Ness just keeps standing there before 
           finally sinking into his chair.

           A moment later the phone RINGS.  Ness picks it up and...

                                 CAPONE (OVER PHONE)
                        What’s the matter, couldn’t rise to 
                        the occasion?  You should send that 
                        little number my way... let her 
                        know what a real man’s like.

           Ness sits bolt upright... sees that his BLINDS are OPEN.

                                 NESS
                        If you’re such a real man then why 
                        don’t you knock on my door...  Or 
                        are you too scared to get your 
                        hands dirty.  Always sending your 
                        thugs to do the real work.

                                 CAPONE (OVER PHONE)
                        Maybe I’ll send ‘em over to your 
                        other gal’s place.

           Ness looks scared for the first time.

                                 CAPONE (OVER PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        What, you think you’re the first 
                        guy to step out on your girl?  At 
                        least you’ve got good taste.  And 
                        Stella sure knows how to show a guy 
                        a good time.  In fact... she’ll be 
                        showing my guys a good time any 
                        minute now--

           Ness drops the phone and digs through his coat pockets -- 
           comes up with Stella’s Key and dashes for the door--
           INT.  STELLA’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Ness flings the door open and rushes into the dark apartment, 
           key still in his hands, eyes wide with fear--

                                 NESS
                        Stella?

           Suddenly a GARROTE WIRE is slipped around his neck -- the 
           DOOR SLAMS shut revealing the tall, thin GHOULISH HITMAN 
           pulling the garrote tight--

           Ness THRASHES -- kicks over an end table filled with chintzy 
           knickknacks -- then he pushes off the ground HARD -- Hitman 
           loses his balance and Ness FLIPS him right over his back 
           using the garrote as a fulcrum--

           The Hitman CRASHES into a chair, garrote still in his hand.  
           Ness coughs, fights for breath, manages to get into a 
           fighting stance.  The Hitman stands up and gets into his own.

           Ness looks him in his dead eyes, looks at the stance... this 
           man knows how to fight.  Ness ATTACKS first--

           Furious kicks and punches -- the Hitman paries, blocks, 
           dodges as fast as Ness can throw them -- startling skill and 
           agility on both sides.  Hitman DUCKS a punch and SWEEPS 
           Ness’s legs out from under him--

           Ness CRASHES to the ground, ROLLS away as the Hitman STOMPS 
           down, misses him by inches--

           Ness flips back up and LOCKS into a grapple with him -- they 
           struggle, push for balance, Ness TWISTS and gets the 
           advantage -- THROWS the Hitman toward a window but--

           The Hitman HOLDS ONTO HIM -- SMASH!  They both CRASH through 
           the window and--

           EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - CONTINUOUS

           SLAM!  They hit hard on the landing of the fire escape -- the 
           landing is only a few square feet -- CLOSE QUARTERS, no room 
           for error -- and a 30 FOOT DROP to the alley below--

           The punches and dodges come quicker now -- Ness takes a 
           brutal SHOT to the stomach, ELBOW to the back -- COUNTERS 
           with rabbit punches, JAB to the throat--

           CRACK!  Ness takes a huge punch to the jaw, he stumbles -- 
           the Hitman flashes the garrote -- STRIKES hard to get it 
           around Ness’s neck but Ness is off balance and--
           He FALLS off the edge of the fire escape -- but manages to 
           GRAB both of the Hitman’s hands -- the Hitman LANDS on his 
           back on the fire escape and the garrote comes right down on 
           the Hitman’s own throat--

           Ness hangs 30 feet above the alley, his entire body weight 
           pulling the garrote down on the Hitman’s throat -- the Hitman 
           thrashes frantically but he’s lying prone, no leverage -- 
           after a moment he goes limp.

           INT.  GARAGE - LATER

           Ness, bruised and limping, enters and sees...

           Leeson, Robsky and Gardner all there.  Gardner has some nasty 
           bruises and abrasions on his face, bandages on his left hand. 
           Leeson and Robsky both have various nicks and cuts on their 
           faces.  Leeson tends to a GASH on Robsky’s forearm.

           Frank is not there.

                                 GARDNER
                        They hit us all at the same time.  
                        I was heading back to the hotel, 
                        got jumped by two guys.

                                 LEESON
                        I was dropping off Robksy -- truck 
                        came out of nowhere.

                                 NESS
                        What about Marty--

                                 GARDNER
                        We’ve got two uniforms on his door.  
                        Guys we can trust.

                                 NESS
                        And Frank?

           They all exchange a look, then... Ness’s eyes flare.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Tell the police to pick him up.  If 
                        they don’t find him by morning, 
                        we’re going after him.

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Ness is curled up asleep on his couch, pistol still in his 
           hand when -- the phone RINGS.  He answers groggily.
                                 NESS
                        Yeah.

           Listens a moment... and he’s INSTANTLY awake.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Where is the son of a bitch?

           EXT.  OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - MORNING

           Ness gets out of his car and approaches a swarm of POLICE and 
           DETECTIVES.  Up ahead a Car is parked on the side of the 
           road.  Ness wades through the scene -- FLASHBULBS go off from 
           police photographers.  He gets to the car and sees...

           FRANK.  Lying in a ditch off the road, hands tied behind his 
           back.  Bloodied and dead.  Ness just looks resigned... but 
           then he notices something inside the car...

           A WOODEN ROCKING HORSE.  And now his face pales.

           EXT.  FRANK BASILE’S “HOUSE” - LATER

           Ness’s shoulders are slumped, his face haggard, eyes down... 
           and the rocking horse hangs from his left hand as Mary Basile 
           opens the door...  Her eyes are red-rimmed.  Ness can’t even 
           look at her.

           Then the 5 Year-Old Boy pushes through the door -- his face 
           lights up as he sees the rocking horse.  He grabs it 
           joyfully, completely unaware of anything else.  Mary keeps 
           starring at Ness as the Boy plays at their feet.

           INT.  TRAIN PLATFORM - LATER

           A LOCOMOTIVE belches STEAM as Passengers board.  A sign above 
           the platform reads, “Fremont, Indiana.”

           Ness stands off to the side, watching, waiting for...

                                 NESS
                        Stella.

           Stella, dressed in traveling clothes and carrying a purse, 
           looks around anxiously -- sees Ness and looks SHOCKED (with a 
           split second of relief).  Forces a smile.

           Ness walks toward her, eyes flat and menacing -- for a moment 
           Stella looks instinctively scared, takes a step backward.  
           Ness reaches out and GRABS her arm -- her purse comes free, 
           drops to the ground and a THICK ROLL OF BILLS spills out.
           Everything Ness suspected is now crystal clear now.  

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        How much did they pay you?

           Stella sets her face, unrepentant.

                                 STELLA
                        Enough so that I’ll never have to 
                        crawl into a man’s bed for money 
                        again.

           Ness just looks wounded, confused...

                                 NESS
                        Did I treat you that badly?

                                 STELLA
                        No.  But how’d you think this could 
                        end?  A picket fence?
                            (pause)
                        I asked you, remember?  Are you 
                        sure you want to get involved with 
                        a girl like me?
                            (pities him)
                        What’d you think was gonna’ happen?

           WHISTLE BLOWS.  She holds his eyes a second longer, then 
           boards the train.

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - LATER

           Ness enters to find--

           SIX MEN in suits ransacking the place -- cabinets and file 
           drawers are open and papers are everywhere.

                                 NESS
                        What the hell’s going on here?

           FRANK WILSON looks up from a file cabinet, flashes Ness a 
           patronizing smile.

                                 WILSON
                        Don’t worry, Mr. Ness, we’ll be out 
                        of your hair soon.  Just taking 
                        what we need for our case.

           To emphasize the point one of the Men pushes past Ness with 
           an armload of files.

                                 NESS
                        Your case?  Against who?
                                 WILSON
                        Al Capone, of course.

           Ness looks completely bewildered.  Wilson just looks at him 
           pitifully, like a lost child.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        We arrested Capone this morning.  
                        Failure to pay federal income tax.  
                        Between our investigation and your 
                        records, we think we can put him 
                        away for ten years.

                                 NESS
                        The man has killed hundreds of 
                        people, and you want to put him 
                        away for not paying his taxes?

           Ness’s voice rises so high that all the Men stop working and 
           look at him.  Wilson doesn’t react, then...

                                 WILSON
                        Well, I think we’re done here for 
                        the moment.  Come on, boys.

           And Wilson and his Men exit, leaving Ness standing in what’s 
           left of his office.

           EXT.  LINCOLN PARK - DAY

           Ness paces back and forth in front of Alexander Jaime, who 
           sits on a park bench calmly.

                                 NESS
                        You knew about this?  And you never 
                        thought to tell me?

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        It wasn’t your concern.

                                 NESS
                        Not my concern?  How is it not--

           Jaime suddenly stands up, gets in Ness’s face.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        Don’t be naive, Eliot.  You think 
                        these men wouldn’t cultivate every 
                        conceivable option?  That they’d 
                        put all their eggs in one basket?
                            (before Ness can respond)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE (CONT'D)
                        And don’t pretend to be angry that 
                        I lied to you -- which I didn’t -- 
                        when what really has you going is 
                        that you wanted to get Capone 
                        yourself.  You wanted the glory.

           Jaime puts a calming hand on his shoulder.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Look -- if not for you, Wilson 
                        never would have made his case.  
                        You guys shut down almost seventy 
                        percent of Capone’s income.  He 
                        can’t afford to pay judges anymore.  
                        He’s going away.

                                 NESS
                        He killed Frank and now he’s going 
                        to jail for not paying his taxes.  
                        Can you tell me that’s justice?

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                            (pause)
                        In Chicago, it is.

           INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

           Ness sits in the back row, sandwiched between Onlookers.  The 
           place is packed, full of excitement... but Ness sits there in 
           a daze.  Doesn’t move, doesn’t react...

                                 PROSECUTOR (O.S.)
                        ...and, your Honor, this is a 
                        listing of the Defendant’s real 
                        estate holdings: Two penthouse 
                        apartments and four houses in 
                        Chicago, an estate in Miami, 
                        Apartments in New York, Apartments 
                        in San Diego...

           Ness never moves a muscle.  Defeated.

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ness looks like hell -- unshaven, wrinkled suit, odds are 
           he’s coming off a bender.  The office is still a mess, files 
           and papers scattered about.  He makes a move to pick up some 
           papers, then stops.  Screw it.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE (O.S.)
                        Eleven years.
           Ness turns around to see Alexander Jaime enter, literally hat 
           in hand.  Looks apologetic.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Judge sentenced him this morning.  
                        Thought you’d want to know.
                            (no response from Ness...)
                        They’re sending him to Alcatraz.  
                        Prison train, tomorrow night.  I 
                        talked to some people and...
                            (pause)
                        You and you’re men can act as the 
                        security detail.  If you’d like.

                                 NESS
                        What makes you think I’d want to?

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        Because, despite everything, I 
                        think you want to finish this.
                            (pause)
                        Because when you set aside 
                        everything... he offends you.  As a 
                        human being he offends you.  And 
                        everything he’s done makes you sick 
                        to your stomach. 

                                 NESS
                        You must think an awful lot of me.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                            (genuine)
                        I do.

           Ness finally looks Jaime in the eye.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Convoy leaves from the jailhouse at 
                        six.  If you want in.

           And Alexander Jaime leaves Ness all alone.

           INT.  CAPONE’S CELL - EVENING

           Capone, dressed in a sharp suit and shackled ankle and wrist, 
           still looks like a king as he sits on his cot.  He fiddles 
           with a pair of GOLD CUFF LINKS as the SCREECHING of bars 
           echoes.  He stands up, still fiddling with his cuffs.

                                 CAPONE
                        Let’s get this show on the...

           He looks up and sees... NESS, flanked by Robsky and Gardner.
                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        ...road.

           Capone smiles, like he’s seeing an old friend.

                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        So they’ve got you playing my 
                        chauffeur now.

           Ness flashes his own smug smile.

                                 NESS
                        Just taking out the trash.

                                 CAPONE
                        Don’t forget to bring my luggage.

           Ness peers around Capone... sure enough, the bastard has two 
           expensive looking suitcases sitting behind him.

           Ness opens up the cell and GRABS Capone roughly by the crook 
           of the arm -- Capone looks like he might rip Ness’s head 
           off... but allows Ness to lead him down the corridor.

           As they pass POLICE OFFICERS Capone smiles, tips his hat.

                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for the hospitality, boys.

           As they exit, realize one of the Police Officers is the 
           INCOMPETENT POLICE SERGEANT, looking around conspiratorially.

           INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The convoy is made up of FOUR VEHICLES:  Two Cars, then a 
           PADDY WAGON, then a third car.  Leeson is already behind the 
           wheel of the Paddy Wagon.  Robsky and Gardner climb into the 
           lead and rear cars, already full of Policemen.

           Ness loads Capone into the back of the Paddy Wagon and gets 
           in after him.

           INT.  PADDY WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           There are two benches on either side.  Capone takes a seat on 
           one, Ness on the other.  As soon as the doors are closed the 
           Wagon starts moving.  Ness lays his shotgun across his lap.

           Capone seems extremely at ease, as if this were a leisurely 
           drive through the country.  Ness never takes his eyes of 
           Capone, almost studying him, analyzing his serenity.
           After a moment Capone opens his jacket to reveal TWO CIGARS 
           tucked in the inside pocket.

                                 CAPONE
                        Care for one?

                                 NESS
                        No, thanks.

           Capone shrugs, suit yourself, pulls one out and lights it up.  
           He puffs out thick, velvety clouds of smoke between smiles.

                                 CAPONE
                        Y’know... I was only ever giving 
                        people what they wanted.  If booze 
                        were legal, I’d just be another 
                        businessman.

                                 NESS
                        If it were legal you wouldn’t want 
                        anything to do with it.

           Capone laughs, nods his head in concession, yeah, maybe.

                                 CAPONE
                        Level with me... you always struck 
                        me as a scotch man.  Am I right?

                                 NESS
                            (nods)
                        But not your scotch.

                                 CAPONE
                        God no -- mine’s terrible.

           Ness can’t help but crack a smile -- he and Capone share the 
           briefest of moments.  Hard not to.

                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        We’re not so different, you and me.

           Moment GONE.  Ness stares at him icily.

                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        You expect me to believe that you 
                        do all of this because you believe 
                        in prohibition, scotch drinker?
                            (leans toward Ness)
                        It’s exciting.  It makes you feel 
                        alive.  Makes you better than the 
                        stiffs who work that desk job.
                            (leans back)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t pretend you’re better than 
                        me.  You just picked a different 
                        side.

           He takes another puff of the cigar.

                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        But anytime you want to switch 
                        sides, just let me know.

                                 NESS
                        Don’t hold your breath.

                                 CAPONE
                            (shrugs)
                        At least I gave you the option.

           Something about the way he says it makes Ness pause -- Capone 
           WINKS at him and then--

           EXT.  STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Suddenly CARS ROAR around corners and converge on the convey 
           from all sides, blocking the route and separating the 
           vehicles -- Leeson is forced to slam on the brakes--

           INT.  PADDY WAGON

           Ness looks out the windows--

           Capone quickly undoes one of the cuff links -- SEE that it is 
           actually a small KEY -- he slides it into the lock on his 
           shackles and -- CLICK--

           Ness looks back just as Capone LUNGES for him, HANDS FREE--

           EXT.  STREET - CONTINUOUS

           MOBSTERS flood out of the cars and OPEN FIRE with Tommy Guns -
           - RAKE the convoy with bullets -- Police officers are 
           shredded where they sit--

           ROBSKY and GARDNER bail out of their cars -- Gardner gets his 
           BAR up and returns fire--

           LEESON looks up just in time to see a CAR headed right for 
           him and -- WHAM!  The car RAMS the cab of the Paddy Wagon, 
           SPINS it around like a top--
           INT.  PADDY WAGON - CON

           The force knocks both Ness and Capone to the ground--

           STRUGGLE -- Ness and Capone GRAPPLE for control of the gun -- 
           Capone’s sheer size and brute strength are overpowering--

           BANGING on the outside of the doors -- Ness fights with 
           everything he has when -- the doors BREAK OPEN to reveal a 
           MOBSTER aiming a gun right at Ness -- Ness YANKS the shotgun 
           with everything he has and--

           BAM -- BLOWS AWAY the MOBSTER--

           The recoil rips the shotgun from Capone’s hands, SLAMS Ness 
           against the back wall -- Capone doesn’t hesitate, just JUMPS 
           out the back of the wagon -- Ness scrambles after him and--

           EXT.  STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Ness doesn’t get more than his head out of the wagon before -- 
           THREE MOBSTERS open fire on the Paddy Wagon, covering Capone 
           as shuffles as fast as he can -- Ness is driven back inside--

           Capone leaps into a waiting car and it SPEEDS off -- all 
           around the other Mobsters jump back into cars and follow--

           Ness finally jumps out of the Paddy Wagon -- sees Gardner and 
           Robsky, unhurt -- no need to discuss--

           Ness PULLS a dead policeman from the driver’s seat of the 
           nearest car -- Gardner opens up the back, TOSSES Capone’s 
           luggage onto the street and -- the suitcases SPILL OPEN to 
           reveal... A BOMB--

                                 GARDNER
                        Get down!

           BOOM!  Everybody is mid-dive as the bomb EXPLODES -- fire and 
           shrapnel ROLL the car into the Paddy Wagon -- Ness hits the 
           deck, covers his head as it FLIPS right over top of him, 
           missing him by inches.

           Ness slowly looks up and sees the devastation...

           SIRENS -- Ness gets back on his feet as a swarm of POLICE 
           CARS zoom onto the scene.  POLICEMEN get out, gawk at the 
           carnage.  Ness approaches a SERGEANT urgently.

                                 NESS
                        They went north -- we can still 
                        catch them if--
           CRACK!  The Sergeant JAMS his nightstick into Ness’s stomach, 
           doubles him over -- instantly two more Police jump on him, 
           force him to the ground, CUFF him.

           With his face pressed against the pavement Ness can see the 
           rest of the Team being abused and cuffed as well.

           INT.  HOLDING CELLS - LATER

           Ness sits exactly where Capone sat just hours earlier.  
           Robsky, Leeson and Gardner are in adjacent cells.  Wounds 
           haven’t even been treated.  The INCOMPETENT POLICEMAN 
           SERGEANT stands nearby, sneering at Ness.

           SCREECH of bars, FOOTSTEPS.  Ness looks up to see Alexander 
           Jaime standing on the other side off the bars -- he looks 
           disgusted as he WHIRLS on the Incompetent Sergeant--

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        Keys!

                                 INCOMPETENT SERGEANT
                        You don’t have the authority to--

           Alexander Jaime grabs him by the lapels and SLAMS him against 
           the bars of Ness’s cell.  Don’t I?

           INT.  OLD TRANSPORTATION BUILDING GARAGE - LATER

           Ness enters quickly, like he’s trying to escape Jaime.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        We want you to go after him.

           WHAM!  Ness PUNCHES Jaime, knocks him to the floor.  Jaime 
           wipes blood from his mouth, but stays humbly on the floor.

                                 NESS
                        Why the hell would I risk my neck 
                        for you?  Again?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Because we’re putting somebody on 
                        that train, Mr. Ness.  If not 
                        Capone, I’m satisfied with you.

           Ness spins around and sees... NUMBER SIX, walking regally 
           with a limp and cane out of the shadows.
                                 NUMBER SIX
                        After all, it was you who allowed 
                        him to escape.

                                 NESS
                        Somebody gave them the route.  
                        Somebody smuggled a bomb into his 
                        cell.  Somebody gave him the key to 
                        the damn handcuffs-- 

                                 NUMBER SIX
                        And for all I know, it was you.

           Ness takes a step toward him -- looks like he could actually 
           take a swing at the old guy but -- Jaime steps between them.

                                 ALEXANDER JAMIE
                        We can keep a lid on it for maybe 
                        24 hours.  But if Capone’s not at 
                        Alcatraz by day after tomorrow...
                            (imploring)
                        Please, Eliot.  If anybody can 
                        bring him back, it’s you.

           Eliot looks venomously at Number Six.  Then...

           INT.  NESS’S OFFICE - LATER

           A WAR ROOM at fever tempo -- Ness pours over street and city 
           maps -- Robsky, Leeson, Gardner come and go furiously.

                                 GARDNER
                        Witnesses saw them heading for the 
                        waterfront--

                                 ROBSKY
                        Dock worker said three men paid 
                        cash for a 26 foot Chris-Craft--

                                 LEESON
                        I’ve got more that saw the boat put 
                        into Lake Michigan not an hour 
                        after they grabbed him.

           Ness flips to a nautical chart of Lake Michigan -- it’s a 
           HUGE LAKE, enormously long from south to north.

                                 GARDNER
                        Won’t go East -- not enough 
                        connections anymore--
                                 NESS
                        Likewise for West -- he’s gotta’ be 
                        running for Canada.

                                 LEESON
                        26-foot-Chris can’t make Canada 
                        without refueling--

                                 NESS
                        So he has to stop somewhere--

                                 ROBSKY
                        Feds seized all his properties--

                                 NESS
                        But he’ll stay someplace safe, 
                        someplace he knows...

           Ness furrows his brown, what am I missing... then...

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Court transcripts--

           Robsky fishes through a pile of papers, comes up with a TOME -
           - Ness grabs it, rifles through it until he finds...

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        “...Two penthouse apartments and 
                        four houses in the Chicago, an 
                        estate in Miami, Apartments in New 
                        York, Apartments in San Diego...”
                            (stops, smiles)
                        They don’t know about it...

           Ness looks up at the Team, waiting anxiously for...

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        He keeps a lake house in Northern 
                        Michigan under his Mother’s maiden 
                        name.  Frankfort, Michigan--

           He points at a coastal spot two-thirds up the Lake.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        That’s where he’s staying.

           Everybody springs back into action -- Ness grabs the phone.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        I can get us a plane fueled and 
                        ready in 2 hours.  Pack your gear.                                                                                                                                                         
                            (to Gardner)
                        That enough time for you to put 
                        together some surprises?
                                 GARDNER
                        More than enough.

           And then commotion stops as... MARTY enters.  He has a slight 
           limp, his face is still bruised, and his right hand and arm 
           are encased in a HARD CAST.  But he’s still smiling.

                                 MARTY
                        Weren’t gonna’ leave without me, 
                        were you, fellas?

           They all look at him in disbelief, then...

                                 NESS
                        You should be in bed.

                                 MARTY
                        Due respect, Chief, but kiss my 
                        ass.  Odds of me sitting this one 
                        out are off the board.

           See it on his face, he’s not backing down.  Ness just nods.

                                 NESS
                        Then grab your gear.

           EXT.  AIRSTRIP - EVENING

           The Team load crates and gear into the back of a small PLANE.

                                 BETTY (O.S.)
                        Eliot.

           Ness turns around to see Betty.  The wind whips around her, 
           tugs at her blouse -- she looks freezing.  Ness quickly walks 
           over to her and puts his suitcoat around her shoulders.

           She seems almost dutiful as she looks into his eyes begins to 
           speak but...

                                 NESS
                        I’m sorry.  I don’t know what to...  
                        I was a complete...
                            (long pause)
                        I love you.

           She looks comforted, as if that was all she ever really 
           wanted to hear from him.  And Ness seems relieved, too.

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        I have to do this -- but I’ll be 
                        back by tomorrow.  One way or 
                        another I’ll be back and I--
           She puts a finger on his lips and looks at him with deep 
           understanding in her eyes.  Acceptance.

           For a moment it looks like Ness may lean in for a kiss, but 
           then he just turns to go -- but then Betty GRABS his arm and 
           pulls him back to her for a BIG KISS -- a genuine, 
           passionate, youthful kiss that turns into a full embrace.

           Finally Betty pulls away and WINKS at Ness.

                                 BETTY
                        Go get him, Mr. Ness.

           She turns and goes.  Ness watches her walk away with a 
           smitten smile.  Marty joins him.

                                 NESS
                            (doesn’t even need to ask)
                        I wonder how she found me...

                                 MARTY
                        I don’t just have your back when 
                        we’re kicking down doors, y’know.

           EXT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           A simple yet dignified brick and shutters two story house 
           with a well manicured lawn, hedges, and garage with several 
           cars parked outside.  Large windows, lights on.  

           To the east side of the house is a winding driveway that 
           disappears into trees after 30 yards.  On the west, a beach 
           and the gently lapping waters of Lake Michigan.  A BOAT HOUSE 
           is perched on the water.

           A dozen MOBSTERS patrol the yard with Tommy Guns.  Johnnie 
           Lamb struts among them like a peacock, acting the general.

           INT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON: a glass filled with scotch -- the good stuff, looks 
           almost like honey as the glass is swirled by a MEATY HAND...

           Capone sits in a leather chair, relaxed and comfortable.  A 
           fire crackles in a brick fireplace.  Three BODYGUARDS stand 
           around the edges of the room, alternate their attention 
           between the door and the windows overlooking the lake.

           As Capone takes a sip of the scotch he smiles.  To judge him 
           by this moment, he hasn’t a care in the world...
           AND THEN the lights cut out.  The Bodyguards tense as the 
           room is left with only the warm glow of the fire.

           EXT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Mobsters all scan the trees and beach as the house goes 
           dark.  SHICK SHACK!  Tommy Guns cock all around the yard...

           VROOM!  They turn to see HEADLIGHTS and then a CAR rocketing 
           straight up the driveway at break-neck speed--

           BRRAPPT!  At least FOUR MUZZLE BURSTS come from the car -- 
           the Mobsters all run for cover, and take up positions as the 
           car keeps racing towards the house--

                                 JOHNNIE LAMB
                        Light ‘em up!

           The Mobsters OPEN FIRE on the car -- bullets rake the windows 
           and doors -- glass shatters, bullet holes everywhere -- the 
           muzzle bursts stop -- but still the car keeps coming, seems 
           OUT OF CONTROL now and--

           WHAM!  It CRASHES into one of the cars parked in the driveway 
           and TURNS OVER.

           The Mobsters stop firing.  Eerie quiet, only the sound of the 
           car’s BACK WHEELS still spinning at top speed.  A Mobster 
           cautiously approaches the car, looks inside...

           EMPTY.  Four Tommy Guns are BOLTED to the doors, their 
           triggers TAPED DOWN.  The accelerator is JAMMED to the floor 
           with a pipe.  And in the back seat is...

           A mass of GRENADES wired together and--

           BOOM!  The car LAUNCHES into the air in a ball of fire -- 
           several more Mobsters are THROWN by the blast -- the car 
           CRASHES back down and flattens another car and then--

           Machine gun fire ERUPTS from the tree line -- precise, 
           accurate fire that takes the Mobsters completely by surprise -
           - three are cut down immediately, the rest run for cover as--

           Marty, Robsky and Leeson charge from the trees -- Marty 
           steadies his Tommy Gun on his cast, Leeson fires two at once, 
           Robsky holds a BAR that looks almost comical in his hands.

           INT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Capone jumps out of his seat at the sound of gunfire -- the 
           Bodyguards take up positions around the DOOR.
                                 BODYGUARD
                        Don’t worry Mr. Capone, nobody’s 
                        getting through that door--

           SMASH!  Suddenly NESS and GARDNER crash through the windows -- 
           attached to ROPE TETHERS -- they just repelled off the roof--

           The Bodyguards are so stunned that they barely dive for cover 
           as Ness and Gardner open up with shotguns -- BAM!  Gardner 
           drills one Bodyguard right in the chest, knocks him down--

           Capone grabs the downed Bodyguard’s gun and FIRES BACK -- 
           CATCHES Gardner in the THIGH -- Ness FLIPS OVER a library 
           table for cover as the room turns into a shoot-out.

           EXT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Marty, Leeson and Robsky take cover behind the remnants of 
           the cars as the Mobsters fall back to the front porch.  Marty 
           looks up, sees muzzle blasts from the upstairs and the 
           shattered windows, looks at his perfectly synched watch:

                                 MARTY
                        Right on time.

           INT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Ness tightens Gardner’s tie around his bleeding thigh.

                                 NESS
                        You gonna’ make it?

           Gardner nods as -- THUNK! A GRENADE lands right by Ness’s 
           foot -- he FLINGS it back over the table -- the grenade 
           bounces off Capone’s chair and INTO THE FIRE--

           BOOM!  Shrapnel blows SMOLDERING LOGS across the room -- one 
           of the Bodyguard’s suits CATCHES FIRE -- he panics, SCREAMS -- 
           reaches frantically out to Capone for help and--

           BAM!  Capone shoots his own Bodyguard in the head -- his body 
           FLOPS to the ground beside the drapes... which CATCH FIRE -- 
           and now it really spreads -- the room GLOWS as more and more 
           furnishings catch--

           Ness and Gardner pop up to fire again -- the last Bodyguard 
           makes a valiant attempt to hold them off but he’s still 
           driven back -- he opens the door and--

                                 BODYGUARD
                        Go, Mr. Capone -- go!
           Capone SPRINTS for the door -- gets through and then -- SLAMS 
           it shut.  The Bodyguard reaches for the knob but -- LOCKED.  
           The Bodyguard looks betrayed before -- BAM!  BAM!  Ness drops 
           him with two shotgun blasts--

           Ness runs to the door, gives it a kick but -- SOLID OAK.  
           Gardner starts coughing -- Ness fires the shotgun around the 
           door frame -- the door comes loose--

                                 NESS
                        ‘Bout damn time that worked!

           He gabs Gardner and helps him limp out--

           EXT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The fire spreads across the outside of the house -- Mobsters 
           panic and run out into the yard where the Team quickly pins 
           them down.  

           Then Marty SEES Johnnie Lamb slipping cowardly away around 
           the back of the house.

           INT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS

           Ness helps Gardner toward the front door -- SUDDENLY a 
           Mobster comes out of nowhere and aims a Tommy Gun at Ness -- 
           Ness is supporting Gardner, can’t reach his pistol but--

           BAM!  Gardner gets his gun up in time to mow him down.  
           Unspoken thanks between them as Ness gets Gardner to the 
           door, but then Ness SEES something back inside the house... a 
           large door that is still swaying OPEN.

           INT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - WINE CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           A large stone cellar with dozens and dozens of wooden wine 
           racks lined up like library shelves, and completely filled 
           with wine bottles.

           Capone runs down a winding staircase and zigzags through the 
           racks to the back wall -- TURNS a particularly dusty bottle 
           in the rack and an entire section SWINGS OPEN. A hidden door. 
           He starts to step through when--

                                 NESS (O.S.)
                        Hold it right there.

           Capone turns around to see Ness aiming a pistol at him.
                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        I always wondered what all the 
                        money from bootlegging could buy. 
                            (looks around at the wine)
                        Turns out it just buys more booze.

                                 CAPONE
                        There’s four cases of Chateau 
                        Lafite 1827 on your left.  Should 
                        fetch enough for you to retire on 
                        when all this prohibition idiocy is 
                        over.  How ‘bout you take that, and 
                        we can say I gave you the slip.

           Slowly, carefully... Capone slips his had inside the door...

                                 NESS
                        For a few cases of 50 year-old 
                        scotch I’d consider it.

                                 CAPONE
                        Those are on your right.

           Now Ness just looks insulted as he reaches for his handcuffs.

                                 NESS
                        Hands on your head, get down on 
                        your knees.

           Capone nods, concedes defeat, starts to kneel and then--

           PULLS a SHOTGUN from inside the hidden door and -- BLAM!  
           Ness dives aside as an entire wine rack DISINTEGRATES.

           INT.  CAPONE’S BOAT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A beautiful hardwood 26 foot CHRIS-CRAFT with an outboard 
           motor bobs in the water, tethered by a line.  Johnnie Lamb 
           scurries inside like a rat.  He sets his pistol down and 
           quickly undoes the tether, then jumps into the boat and PULLS 
           the starter -- the motor purs to life.

           Lamb gets behind the wheel, puts the throttle down and starts 
           to move but -- JERK!  The Boat stops suddenly.  He looks back 
           to see the boat is still tethered... and Marty is standing on 
           the dock with his Cheshire grin, aiming a pistol at him.

                                 MARTY
                        How did Capone ever hire a 
                        spineless weasel like you?
           Lamb is almost shaking at he stares at Marty’s gun.  He 
           glances at his own pistol, sitting on the dock.  Marty 
           notices and... KICKS the pistol into the water.

                                 JOHNNIE LAMB
                        I’ll come quietly.

                                 MARTY
                        What on earth makes you think I’d 
                        want you to do that?  We’ve got 
                        some unfinished business.

           Lamb is almost pissing himself... but then... Marty TOSSES 
           his own gun into the water too.

           Now Lamb’s courage starts to come back.  He sizes up Marty: 
           still bruised and with that cast on his hand and arm... an 
           easy foe if ever there was one.  Lamb sneers as he climbs out 
           of the boat and onto the dock...

                                 JOHNNIE LAMB
                        This time I’m really gonna’ hurt 
                        you.

                                 MARTY
                        And this time I’m really gonna’ fix 
                        that nose.

           They clash.

           INT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - WINE CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           Ness and Capone shoot back and forth as wood splinters, 
           bottles shatter, and wine explodes.  They duck behind the 
           remains of the racks, but there’s less and less cover--

           CLICK!  Ness’s pistol runs empty -- Capone grins manically -- 
           BAM!  Ness barely dives out of the way of a shotgun blast -- 
           he rolls but Capone is fast and Ness comes right up into--

           A shotgun pressed against his chest.

           Capone savors the victory, Ness braces for death.  Capone 
           pulls the trigger and -- CLICK.  Empty.  Capone looks 
           furiously at the shotgun, then FLINGS it away.

           Ness and Capone separate, eye each other like prizefighters 
           before the bell rings.  Ness takes up a crisp jujitsu stance, 
           Capone settles into a bare-knuckle brawler’s bouncing crouch.  
           Their two styles could not be more diametrically opposed.

           Capone CHARGES at Ness -- throws heavy punches -- Ness dodges 
           the first but -- WHAM!  
           Takes the second like a freight train to the jaw, stumbles 
           back but recovers -- SPINS and WHIPS a kick that catches 
           Capone across the face-- 

           Bottles crunch beneath their feet.  Ness and Capone both spit 
           blood into the puddles of wine -- they collide again--

           INT.  CAPONE’S BOAT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Marty and Lamb are far less impressive -- Lamb fights like a 
           street corner drunk, flinging punches and kicks -- trying for 
           eyes and groins--

           Marty is more tactical -- his injuries slow him down but he 
           grits his teeth and fights through the pain--

           CRUNCH!  Marty crashes his hard cast down on Lamb’s nose -- 
           BLOOD spurts -- Lamb screams -- another broken nose.

                                 MARTY
                        There, that looks better--

           WHAM!  Lamb lands a punch that sends Marty reeling -- Lamb 
           grabs a CROWBAR from a pile of tools and SWINGS IT -- Marty 
           manages to duck but Lamb stays after him--

           WHACK!  Another blow sends Marty to the ground -- he lands 
           HARD right beside the cleat and boat tether.  Lamb stands 
           over him, triumphantly smug.  But Marty smiles...

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Y’know, there’s something I’ve been 
                        meaning to say to you... You were 
                        ugly before I broke your nose.

           And Marty YANKS the boat tether off the cleat and WRAPS it 
           around Lamb’s ankle--

           NOW FREE, the boat ROCKETS away from the dock -- Lamb has a 
           split second to make pitiful eye contact with Marty before 
           he’s -- YANKED off the dock and dragged out to sea.

           INT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - WINE CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           The punches and kicks are furious -- the dodges almost 
           lightning fast.  Neither shows signs of tiring.  Ness lands a 
           punch that doesn’t even faze Capone, but follows with a kick 
           to the gut that knocks him down--

           Capone GRABS a broken bottle from the floor and SWIPES -- 
           CUTS Ness across the bicep.  Ness dodges another swipe and 
           lashes out with a jab that disarms Capone, but--
           CRUNCH!  Capone connects an enormous uppercut that takes Ness 
           right off his feet and onto the floor -- Ness’s face lands 
           inches from a JAGGED BOTTLE--

           Before Ness can move Capone is on him -- they grapple, but 
           Capone is just too strong for Ness and begins FORCING his 
           neck toward the jagged bottle--

           Ness pushes with everything he has, but Capone is like an ox 
           and he pushes him closer... and closer...

           EXT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Robsky, Leeson and a limping Gardner finish putting cuffs on 
           the Mobsters.  SNAP!  GROAN!  The house MOANS as beams and 
           floors crack and break -- the house begins to collapse.

           INT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - WINE CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           Ness’s neck inches closer to the razor sharp bottle -- his 
           whole body shakes, can’t hold out much longer.  Capone grins, 
           puts all his weight on him and--

           Suddenly Ness GIVES IN -- his neck rushes toward the bottle 
           but at the last second he JERKS to the side with everything 
           he has -- the bottle SLICES his cheek and then--

           IMBEDS itself in Capone’s shoulder--

           Capone screams, jumps off Ness, then grits his teeth and 
           YANKS the glass out and tosses it aside.  Capone’s eyes look 
           like pure murder and he starts to charge again but--

           GROAN!  They both look up and see a massive ceiling beam 
           buckle and -- they both dive out of the way as the beam FALLS-

           CRASH!  The beam lands in the middle of the room... and TRAPS 
           Ness beneath it.  But sees Ness lying there defenseless, 
           vulnerable... and he looks absolutely delighted...

                                 CAPONE
                        You’re all mine now...

           Ness struggles to pull himself out from under the beam as 
           Capone starts toward him--

           GROAN!  Another flaming beam comes loose and BLOCKS Capone’s 
           path.  Capone ROARS with anger, looks like he may barrel his 
           way through it anyway but--
           GROAN!  The ceiling is about to give way.  Capone looks at 
           Ness one more time, then retreats through the hidden doorway.  
           Ness keeps struggling -- gets his first leg free--

           CREAK!  He strains, PULLS -- fights against the weight, 
           against the broken glass beneath his leg and then -- he gets 
           free -- doesn’t hesitate -- just DIVES for the hidden doorway 
           as the ceiling completely gives way and--

           EXT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Marty joins the others as the house completely collapses.  
           Marty looks around, doesn’t see Ness and...

                                 MARTY
                        He’s not--

           But the look and everybody’s face says it.  He is.

           EXT.  CLIFF SIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           An overgrown stone DOORWAY empties onto a small cliff side 
           overlooking Lake Michigan.  Ness exits the doorway in a jog, 
           looks around... doesn’t see Capone as--

           CRACK!  Ness is driven to his knees as--

           CAPONE comes from behind and hits him across the back with a 
           heavy tree limb.  Capone’s eyes are scary, flat and dead.  
           Bent on nothing but violence and death--

           CRACK!  He hits Ness again and drives him to the ground.

                                 CAPONE
                        How many chances did I give you?  I 
                        tried to pay you -- I tried to warn 
                        you.  I shot at your girlfriend.  
                        Killed your driver.

           He reels back to hit Ness again but Ness ROLLS to the side -- 
           the branch SNAPS at it hits the stony ground.  Capone just 
           tosses it aside as Ness get back on his feet.

                                 CAPONE (CONT’D)
                        Why won’t you just quit?

           Ness lunges for Capone -- they trade punches -- not blocking 
           anymore, just pummeling each other.  Ness looks like a man 
           possessed.  A man DRIVEN by something only he understands...
                                 NESS
                        Because every time you tried to 
                        bribe me, tried to kill me--

           WHAM!  WHAM!  Ness lands two shots that actually STUN Capone--

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        Every time you hurt my friends--

           CRACK!  Another shot sends Capone reeling--

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        You weren’t scaring me--

           WHACK!  Massive KICK to Capone’s gut brings him to his knees--

                                 NESS (CONT’D)
                        You were just convincing me that I 
                        had to win, no matter what the cost-

           Ness rears back and -- WHAM!  Hardest punch yet, Capone 
           CRASHES to the ground like a lumbered tree.  Capone, bruised, 
           bloodied and beaten, looks up at Ness.

                                 CAPONE
                        What’re you gonna’ do now, kill me?

                                 NESS
                        No.... I’m going to arrest you.

           And Ness FINALLY HANDCUFFS Capone.  The cuffs seem to CLICK 
           extra loud as they lock in place.

           EXT.  CAPONE’S LAKE HOUSE - LATER

           Dawn is just breaking.  The Team loads the Mobsters into a 
           Paddy Wagon.  Faces are flat, no celebration.  Marty looks 
           especially morose as he leans against a car, looks out at the 
           lake.  No trace of his trademark smile.

                                 LEESON
                        That’s the last one.

           Marty just nods, opens the car door and...

                                 NESS (O.S.)
                        Got room for two more?

           The Team spins around to see...

           NESS, pulling a handcuffed Capone alongside him.
           CELEBRATION breaks out -- Capone rolls his eyes as the Team 
           claps Ness on the back, brotherly congratulations.  Ness 
           loads him into the paddy Wagon and shuts the door.

                                 MARTY
                        You know what this makes you, 
                        Chief?
                            (HUGE grin)
                        You’re the man who got Al Capone.

           Ness smiles as they get into the car and drive away.

                                                               THE END
