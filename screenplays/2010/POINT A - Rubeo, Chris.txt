           FADE IN:

           AT A COMPUTER, SOMEWHERE

           Teenage eyes stare.  Pop music plays.  Small fingers tap out 
           earnest keystrokes.  A delicate hand touches a slight chin.  

           A bathroom mirror.  An awkwardly sexy pose.  A camera’s 
           flash.  A USB cord plugged.  The words ”Upload your image 
           now?”  An “enter” key.  A smirk.  A “delete” key.  

           Bits and pieces of words: “Favorite Things,”  “What I Hate,”  
           “What do you think of me?”  “What are you doing right now?”  
           More kewl music.  More angsty words.  More hopeful images...

                                                         CROSS FADE TO:

           INT. CLEVELAND - “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY

           JOSH BENNETT, 35, boyishly handsome, easygoing, with a tinge 
           of middle-class frustration, strides down a row of cubicles.  

           Inside each, sit MEN, 25-40ish, most of whom are occupied 
           with ‘work’ that has nothing to do with the magazine.  
           There’s googling, emailing, live chats and social networking, 
           but today’s big fascination is the latest viral web video.

           A disembodied hand grabs Josh‘s elbow.  It’s VINCE, 30’s, 
           still wearing the dress shirt that barely fit him in college.

                                 VINCE
                        Josh!

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, Vince.

                                 VINCE
                        Dude, you see this?  Effed up!

           He hits a key and they watch as a man’s crotch meets the 
           business end of a goose’s beak.  

           Vince winces.  Josh flashes a polite smile.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, it’s funny, I saw it.  Back 
                        there, and around over on that 
                        side, too.  Totally... “effed.”
                             (beat)
                        Um, I gotta talk to Mike.

           Vince nods, eyes still glued to the screen.  Josh walks off.
           MIKE’S OFFICE

           Trophies, jerseys, life-size promotional cutouts -- it’s a 
           sports bar for a crowd of one.  A floor-to-ceiling Today’s 
           Guy magazine cover features a sexy bikini-clad girl holding a 
           cigar, and a banner that reads: “Me, quit SMOKIN’?”

           MIKE HANSON, 40’s, a guy’s guy, bad knees and awkward charm, 
           sits chuckling, engrossed in his computer screen.

           Josh arrives at the open door.  He knocks and enters.

                                 MIKE
                        Josh, check this out.  Oh, man! 

           He flips the screen around.  It’s the same “cringe” video.  
           Josh and Mike watch as the unfortunate man once again 
           abandons all hope of siring a family.  Mike yelps and laughs.

                                 JOSH
                             (sits)
                        Yeah, I saw it out in the -- 

                                 MIKE
                        I never look at these things.
                             (pushes the screen aside)
                        Anyway, first, let me tell what an 
                        awesome job you did on this piece 
                        last month.  Phenomenal feedback.

           He opens a copy of Today’s Guy and turns it to face Josh.

                                 JOSH
                             (reads article title)
                        “The Top Ten Most Graphic Single-
                        Shooter Video Games.”

                                 MIKE
                        Loved it.  Especially this one, 
                        Terror -- what was it...?

                                 JOSH
                        Terror Strike.

                                 MIKE
                        Right.  “Most realistic organ 
                        splatter.”  Sweet stuff.

                                 JOSH
                        Nothing’s too good for our readers.

                                 MIKE
                        Come on, this is a great piece!
                                 JOSH
                        It’s crap.

                                 MIKE
                        Sure it’s crap.  But it’s 
                        brilliantly written crap.  No one 
                        in Cleveland writes crap like you.

                                 JOSH
                        Thanks, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Josh, am I stopping you from 
                        quitting this gig and going for a 
                        Pulitzer Prize?

           Josh doesn’t have an answer.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, I’m sympathetic to your 
                        desire to go more highbrow; I think 
                        you’ll like this one.  I want to do 
                        a piece on these video blogs.  
                        Really get into the mind of the 
                        ‘vlogger’ who feels compelled to 
                        expose their deepest secrets in 
                        words and images on the internet.

                                 JOSH
                        Kind of cultural commentary?  What 
                        do these sites say about us; what 
                        we’ve become; have we taken 
                        narcissism to its extreme?

                                 MIKE
                        Exactly.

                                 JOSH
                        Nice.

                                 MIKE
                        But with bikini girls.

           Josh does a double take.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s summertime, our readers want 
                        bikini girls.  Specifically college-
                        aged emotionally-unstable ones.  
                        With eating disorders.  And 
                        preferably, a taste for men in the 
                        thirty to forty-five age range.
                                 JOSH
                             (beaten)
                        Anything else?

                                 MIKE
                        Nope.  Just pick the hottest one in 
                        the Cleveland area and profile her.  
                        And be thinking photo spread.

           Josh, looking weary, gets up to leave.

                                 MIKE
                        Josh, wait a minute.  
                             (beat)
                        You’ve been here, what, five years?

                                 JOSH
                        Seven, actually.

                                 MIKE
                        Seven years.  Man, that clock on 
                        the wall just spins, doesn’t it?

                                 JOSH
                        Tell me about it.

                                 MIKE
                        And you’ve got a girlfriend, who I 
                        remember is, if you don’t mind me 
                        saying, not too hard on the eyes?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, Lisa’s great.

                                 MIKE
                        So, you’ve got a fairly well-paying 
                        job and a gorgeous girlfriend, but 
                        you never seem happy.

                                 JOSH
                        What do you mean?  I’m happy.

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t lie to me, you’re miserable.

           Josh frowns.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m gonna let you in on a little 
                        secret.  Nobody’s happy.

                                 JOSH
                        Really.
           Mike catches site of Vince passing his door.

                                 MIKE
                        Vince!

                                 VINCE
                        Yup?

                                 MIKE
                        Are you happy?

                                 VINCE
                        You kiddin’? It's all I can do not 
                        to drown myself in the shower every 
                        morning.

                                 JOSH
                        Jesus.

           Vince smiles and walks off.

                                 MIKE
                        May I tell you the one thing that 
                        might just bring you happiness?

                                 JOSH
                        Sure, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Commitment.

                                 JOSH
                        Commitment?

                                 MIKE
                        Yes, commitment.  You’re an adult.  
                        This is your life.  Don’t fight it.  
                        Accept your fate.  And be happy.

                                 JOSH
                        Commitment.  Got it.

           Josh stands and heads for the door.

                                 MIKE
                        Think about it.  And Josh?  My door 
                        is always open.  I’m not just your 
                        boss, I’m your friend.  Door.  
                        Mine.  Open.  You.

                                 JOSH
                        Thanks, Mike.

           He leaves.  Mike seems pleased with himself.
           INT. JOSH’S CAR - DAY (MOVING)

           Josh gazes quizzically out at various icons of middle-class 
           life; teenagers gathered on a sidewalk, a busy mall, mothers 
           pushing strollers, and row upon row of cookie-cutter houses.

           INT. JOSH’S APT - NIGHT

           It’s the Crate & Barrel catalogue, page 26.  Josh enters.

           On a puffy couch sits LISA, 30ish, strikingly pretty with a 
           confidence held exclusively by the “strikingly pretty.”  
           She’s on her cell phone, tissue in hand.  She’s been crying.

                                 LISA
                             (into phone)
                        Oh, Mom, Josh just came in.  I 
                        will.  I will.  Okay.  Love you.  

           She puts the phone down.  Josh immediately senses her mood.

                                 JOSH
                        Lisa?  What’s up, babe?  

                                 LISA
                        Josh...

                                 JOSH
                        What is it?

           He sits on the couch next to her.  He’s really concerned.  

                                 LISA
                        Honey, I need you to just listen to 
                        me, okay?  I’ve given this a lot of 
                        thought and there are things I just 
                        have to say to you.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay...

                                 LISA
                        Josh, we’ve been together for six 
                        years now, and I know how we both 
                        agreed that we could just live 
                        together and that marriage wasn’t 
                        important, but Josh, you’re thirty-
                        five years old and I’m almost 
                        thirty-one -- 

                                 JOSH
                        Lisa, we’ve been over this before --
                                 LISA
                        I know, but things are different 
                        now.

                                 JOSH
                        How?

                                 LISA
                             (losing her cool)
                        I’ve never been almost thirty-one 
                        before!
                             (beat, calmer)
                        Honey, my home organizing business 
                        is doing great, and you won’t be 
                        leaving the magazine any time soon.

           Josh winces almost imperceptibly.

                                 LISA
                             (more and more upset)
                        It’s just that I don’t want to keep 
                        organizing other people’s homes and 
                        coming back to this apartment.  I 
                        want my own home to organize.  I 
                        want us to have a real home.  
                        Together.  I just can’t deal with 
                        this uncertainty anymore.  I 
                        thought I could, but I can’t.  I 
                        need security in my life.  You can 
                        understand that, can’t you?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.  I can.

                             (crying now)
                        Josh, I’m really happy in our 
                        relationship.  Aren’t you happy?

                                 JOSH
                        Happy?

                                 LISA
                        Since we’re both happy and we’re 
                        not getting any younger, I mean, 
                        what more do you want?  Is there 
                        something more you want?

           Josh really tries to respond, but somehow can’t.

                                 LISA
                        We’re great together.  We’re a 
                        great couple.

                        But that’s not enough, Josh.  I 
                        need to be married.  I need a 
                        commitment.

                                 JOSH
                        A commitment?

                                 LISA
                        Yes.  A commitment.

           A long pause.  Josh is dizzy with swirling thoughts, then --

                                 JOSH
                        Okay.

                        Okay, what?

                                 JOSH
                        Let’s do it.  Let’s get married.

                        Are you serious?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.  Yes.  Yes, I am.

                        should we do it?

                                 JOSH
                        Umm... a couple of months?

           Lisa hugs and kisses Josh.  He tries to kiss her more, but --

                                 LISA
                        Mom, did you hear that?

                        You mother was on speaker phone?

                        I wanted her moral support.

           She excitedly grabs her phone and talks to her mother, as --

           Josh sits by, waiting.  And waiting...
           INT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - JOSH’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Josh sips coffee and taps at his computer.  

           He brings up site named “VlogNow.com.”  He searches on 
           “Cleveland,” and up comes the top-rated page: “Cloe’s World.”  
           At the top is a slickly posed, but partially obscured image 
           of a sexy dark-haired girl.

                                 JOSH

                        the nonsense fired across my bow.”

           He rolls his eyes, then his cursor over Cloe’s Bio: “Place: 
           Cleveland, Time: Indefinite, Mood: Awash in Dreams, Age: 22.”

                        Okay, Miss Self-involved, hit me.

           He clicks on the link: “My Latest Vlog.”  The video starts.  
           It’s dreamy, artfully-composed sounds and images of youth - 
           intense conversations, sneakers on pavement, laughter, 
           hairstyles, mp3 players, phones, steaming coffee, texts, IMs - 
           all accompanied by words spoken in a thoughtful girl’s voice:

                        “My generation: elitists, posers, 
                        jocks and misfits.  We hide in the 
                        spaces between the notes and 
                        melodies of our indie rock.  We 
                        dream up revolutions we’ll never 
                        start.  We just want underground 
                        music in underground places...”

           Josh sits back, impressed with what he’s watching.

                                 CLOE’S VLOG NARRATION
                        “We're a generation allergic to 
                        silence.  We pour our lives into 
                        the internet; our names, replaced 
                        with screen names; the sound of our 
                        voices, replaced by the 'BLING!' of 
                        an instant message.  We have the 
                        world at our fingertips, stored in 
                        a box on our desk.  But is the 
                        world so shallow and malleable?  Is 
                        it that predictable and small?  
                        Does nothing exceed 2-D?”

                        This actually doesn’t suck.
           He clicks on a link: “Contact Cloe.”  An email window opens.  
           Josh’s words can be heard as he types them:

           EXT. CLOE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           A digital camera set on tripod faces a sunlit suburban yard.  
           CLOE VARDIS’ hand reaches in and sets the timer.  Visible 
           only from the neck down, she’s a slender girl in jeans, Chuck 
           Taylors and a hoodie. She runs into the shot.   

           The camera counts down, Cloe leaps into the air, and CLICK - 
           an animated pose is frozen in time.  CLICK - CLICK - CLICK, 
           three more gravity-defying moves, then --

           ‘BLING’ her cell phone signals the incoming email.

           Cloe picks it up, reads the mail -- spots the words “Today’s 
           Guy,” “feature article with photos,” and “contact me.”  With 
           lightning dexterity she texts a response:

           INT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - JOSH’S CUBICLE - DAY

           ‘Bloop,’ Cloe’s email response instantly appears in Josh’s 
           inbox. A bit stunned, he clicks on it.  Her voice narrates:

                                 CLOE’S EMAIL
                        “Fuck off, creep.”

           Josh’s mouth literally drops open, but he quickly recovers 
           and composes an answer:

                                 JOSH’S EMAIL
                        “I appreciate the speedy response,

                        idea of the tone of this piece...”

           EXT. CLOE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           On her phone, Cloe reads the rest of Josh’s response and the 
           words “...feel free to check my credentials.”

           INT. CLOE’S HOUSE - CLOE’S ROOM - DAY

           Cloe searches the web and spots an article: “Cleveland’s,

           ‘Bloop,’ Cloe’s response appears.  Josh chuckles.  It’s been 
           no more than a minute since his response to her.  He clicks:

                        Okay, she’s eloquent and fickle.

           He starts typing a response...

           Laptops, cell phones, and conversations over $4.00 coffees.

           Josh enters.  He scans the room, then gets in line.  He 
           watches a sweet-faced teenage girl BARISTA call out orders.

                                 BARISTA
                        Grande latte, tall soy latte, tall 
                        latte, grande skinny latte!

           She turns her attention to Josh.

                                 BARISTA
                        Can I take your order?

                                 JOSH
                        Guess I’m having a latte!

           The Barista is unmoved.

                                 JOSH
                        Um... venti. Decaf.

                                 BARISTA
                        Name?

                                 JOSH
                        Josh.

           He pays.  The Barista eyes him as he leaves the counter.

           Josh looks around the room again, then spots an attractive, 
           DARK-HAIRED GIRL in a corner, engrossed in a book.  He sits 
           at a free table adjacent to her, then leans in...

                                 JOSH
                        Um, Cloe?
           The dark-haired girl smiles and shakes her head.  

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, sorry, I’m --

                        Josh!

           Josh turns and is surprised to find the Barista seated in 
           front of him, holding his coffee.  The Barista, who is...

                                 CLOE
                        Decaf latte for the writer?

                                 JOSH
                        Thanks.  Cloe?

           Cloe flashes a cheesy smile.  Josh is perplexed.

                                 CLOE
                        Sorry about the subterfuge.  A girl 
                        can’t be too careful these days.

                                 JOSH
                        Wait, you are Cloe with the vlog?

                                 CLOE
                        I am that Cloe.  

                                 JOSH
                        And you’re twenty-two?

                                 CLOE
                        I’m not that Cloe.

                                 JOSH
                        Well, you’re over eighteen, right?

           Cloe looks guilty.

                                 JOSH
                        Seventeen?

           Cloe kind of squints like she’s in pain...

                                 JOSH
                        You’re sixteen?  Your profile says 
                        twenty-two.

           The Dark-haired Girl looks up from her book.

                                 CLOE
                        My profile says a lot of things.  
                        You wanted to talk about my vlogs?
                                 JOSH
                        I did.  I do, I just.  Um... I just 
                        don’t think this is going to work.

                                 CLOE
                        I thought you liked my writing?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, it’s really excellent.  It’s 
                        insightful; very impressive.

                                 CLOE
                        But it’s not impressive now that 
                        I’m sixteen?

                                 JOSH
                        No, it’s just that you’re a minor, 
                        and the piece I’m writing, is --

                                 CLOE
                        That is such bullshit! 

           Josh looks around.  Suddenly, it’s as if every eye is on him.

                                 CLOE
                        What I write has no validity now 
                        because of my age?  Why do you 
                        think I fucking lied on my profile?

                                 JOSH
                        Nice mouth, little girl.

                                 CLOE
                        Nice decaf, gramps.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, you know what?  This was a 
                        mistake, and now I’m gonna leave.

           He rises and heads for the door.  Cloe, annoyed, watches him.

                                 CLOE
                        “Little girl?”  Jerk.

           Josh slams the door, then checks himself in the mirror.

                        “Gramps?”
                             (looks at his coffee)
                        It’s a big coffee and it’s late in 
                        the day!

                        Honey, look.  This site lets me 
                        plan out every aspect of our 
                        marriage, from booking the 
                        reception hall down to the rental 
                        car for the honeymoon.  Nothing 
                        left to chance.  See?

           Josh looks.  The page’s banner reads “Tie The Knot: Tight.” 
           Beneath it is a tacky animation of a bride putting a ball & 
           chain around the leg of a profusely sweating groom.  

                                 LISA
                        Isn’t this cute?

           The animated groom momentarily mesmerizes Josh.

                                 LISA
                             (teasingly pokes Josh)
                        Isn’t it cute?

                                 JOSH
                        Um... Yeah.  Yeah, that’s great.

           “BLING” - Josh’s phone announces a new text.  Lisa’s 
           attention returns to her computer.

                                 JOSH
                        Who’s texting me this late?

           He opens his phone.  It‘s a text from Cloe; in her voice:

                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “You call yourself a real journal-
                        ist, but you let a ‘little girl’ 
                        scare you off?  Check your email.”

                                 JOSH
                        How the...?

                                 LISA
                             (half-interested)
                        What’s that, hon?

                                 JOSH
                        Work thing.  I’m doing a piece on 
                        video blogs and I went to interview 
                        this girl today.

                        Her profile said she was twenty-
                        two, but she was actually sixteen.

                                 LISA
                        Sixteen?

           Josh checks his email. There’s a new message from 
           “Cloe_Vardis@genmail.com.”  He opens it.  It’s a link to 
           Cloe’s new Vlog.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, talented girl, but sixteen.  
                        Now, she not only somehow got my 
                        cell number, but she’s emailed me.

                                 LISA
                        Maybe she’s got a little crush?

                                 JOSH
                        That’s what I need.

           Lisa gets up and walks off.  

           Josh brings up Cloe’s vlog and watches.  It features Cloe 
           narrating and starring in a ‘micro-movie’ of each idea.

                                 CLOE’S NARRATION
                        “Seven Random Facts About Me...
                        One: I love the smell of cigar 
                        smoke; it reminds me of my grampa;”

                    Cloe, outside a cigar store, inhales deeply, closes her
                    eyes, then flashes on an old man’s hands and kind smile.

                        “Two: I have an incurable fear of 
                        things that sit underwater (not 
                        fish or animals) but logs, plants, 
                        big rocks; that kind of thing;”

                    A moss-covered log in a pond finds Cloe nearby, teeth
                    clenched and eyes wide.

           Through the laptop screen, Josh smiles.

                                 CLOE’S NARRATION
                        “Three: When I open a carton of 
                        eggs, there has to be an even 
                        amount.  If not, I will find a use 
                        for the odd-numbered egg;”

                    Cloe discovers seven eggs in an egg carton, frowns.
                    Suddenly, an egg’s broken onto the head of a baffled 
                    Pug, who then gets a rigorous hair treatment.

                        “Four: I can’t help but feel sorry 
                        for inanimate objects;”

                    Cloe raises a turkey baster and grimaces with sympathy.

                        “Five: I've come up with several 
                        great ideas that could make lots of 
                        money, but I've never done anything 
                        with any of them;”

                    Cloe holds a notebook out before her, smiles wide at a
                    page, then abruptly tears it off, crumples and tosses it
                    into a ready pile nearby. 

                        “Six: I get waves of guilt for 
                        things that shouldn't make anyone 
                        feel guilty;”

                    Cloe pulls off the last paper towel, stares at the empty
                    roll, then furrows her brow.

                        “Seven: I like my camera more than 
                        I like most people.”

                    Cloe emerges from behind a digital camera.  She stares
                    straight ahead, and a sly smile creeps across her face.

           The vlog fades to black.  

           Josh stares at the blank screen, frowning in thought.  A few 
           more moments pass, then he abruptly closes the laptop.

           INT. SUNRISE MALL - C-TOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Josh somewhat uneasily sits across from Cloe, who looks 
           through some sheets of paper.

                                 CLOE
                        My mom is totally not gonna care.

                                 JOSH
                        That’s fine, but I still need her 
                        to sign that consent form if I’m 
                        going to interview you.

                                 CLOE
                        Because I’m a ‘minor.’  What a 
                        horrible word.

           She taps at her cell phone.
                                 JOSH
                        All it means that you’re under 
                        eighteen.

                                 CLOE
                             (reads cell phone screen)
                        False.  It also means, “lesser or 
                        secondary in size, frequency, or 
                        importance.  Not very serious.  
                        Insignificant.”  That’s just rude.

                                 JOSH
                        It could also mean ‘minor,’ as in a 
                        ‘minor key’ in music.

                                 CLOE
                        Yes, but isn’t the minor key the 
                        sad-sounding key?

           Josh frowns.  Cloe smiles, proud of herself.

                                 JOSH
                             (checks his cell phone)
                        What time did your mother say she’d 
                        be here?

           Just then, Cloe catches sight of her mother, DONNA VARDIS, 
           mid 30’s, a bit rough around the edges.  She wears a cheap 
           dress suit.  Cloe waves her over.

                                 CLOE
                        Mom, this is --

           Josh half-stands as Donna plops down across from him.

                                 JOSH
                        Josh Bennett.

                                 DONNA
                        So, you’re the writer who wants to 
                        exploit my underage daughter in 
                        your sex magazine?

           Josh winces.  Donna smiles, and only glances at the papers.

                                 DONNA
                        Just playing with you.  Donna 
                        Vardis. What’s the story, now?

                                 JOSH
                        Well, I, I think Cloe’s writing and 
                        the work she’s put up in her vlogs 
                        is really interesting and creative.

                        I just need your permission to 
                        interview her for an article.

                                 CLOE
                             (in faux hillbilly accent)
                        Josh thinks I’m a genius, mama.

                                 DONNA
                        Any brains she does have she got 
                        from me.  Got a pen?

           Josh retrieves one.  Donna eyes him over.

                                 DONNA
                        You have any kids?

                                 JOSH
                        No, no, I’m, I’m not married.  
                        Engaged, actually, just recently.

                                 DONNA
                             (stares at him a moment)
                        That’s a shame.
                             (signs release)
                        I got no problem with this.  It’s 
                        Cloe’s decision.  She knows I trust 
                        her judgement a hundred percent.

                                 CLOE
                             (same hillbilly accent)
                        Mama thinks I’m a genius, Josh.

                                 DONNA
                        The dorkish quality, she got from 
                        her father.
                             (beat, she stands)
                        I gotta get back to work.  Just 
                        enough time for a cigarette...

           She looks at Cloe expectantly.  Josh is puzzled.

                                 CLOE
                        How many is that today?

                                 DONNA
                        This’ll be four, ma’am.

                                 CLOE
                        Okay, then...

           She pulls a pack of cigarettes from her purse and hands one 
           to Donna, who pops it into her mouth.
                                 DONNA
                        She’s too good to me.
                             (shakes hands with Josh)
                        Okay, you two have fun.
                             (to Cloe)
                        See you later, sweetie.

           Donna leaves.  Cloe turns to Josh and smiles.

                                 JOSH
                        You and your mother have an 
                        interesting relationship.

                                 CLOE
                        I’m an only child.  She’d totally 
                        die without me.

                                 JOSH
                        And your dad?

                                 CLOE
                        My dad, or as my mom refers to him, 
                        “the asshole sperm-donor;” he’s 
                        around.
                             (convincing herself)
                        He was never really cut out to be a 
                        father - too much of a free spirit - 
                        which is something my mom cannot 
                        understand, but I do.  He just 
                        needs to be free, you know?

                                 JOSH
                        Sure.

                                 CLOE
                        What about your family?

                                 JOSH
                        I thought I was interviewing you.

                                 CLOE
                             (playfully)
                        Yes, but if you want to plumb the 
                        depths of my fragile teenage 
                        psyche, how am I to trust you if 
                        you don’t reveal something to me?

           Josh stares curiously at Cloe for a moment.

                                 JOSH
                        My dad died of a heart attack about 
                        five years ago.  I keep in pretty 
                        good touch with my mother.

                        And I’ve got an older brother, who 
                        last we heard, was somewhere 
                        between Florida and Texas.

                                 CLOE
                        You’re the rock of the family.  The 
                        one upon whose shoulders all things 
                        fall.  That’s got to suck.

           Josh doesn’t have a response.

                                 CLOE
                        And you just got engaged?

                                 JOSH
                        Oh.  Uh, yeah.

                                 CLOE
                        Are you just totally in love?

                                 JOSH
                             (laughs)
                        I hope so, we’re getting married.

           Something about Josh’s response sticks with Cloe, but she 
           says nothing.  Josh reaches into his bag.

                                 JOSH
                        You want to get started?

                                 CLOE
                        I thought we already had.

           Josh produces a digital audio recorder, then a few sheets of 
           paper containing a long list of questions.  Cloe chuckles.

                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 CLOE
                        You’re very organized.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.

           Josh turns on the audio recorder.  Cloe straightens up.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, Cloe Vardis. You’re sixteen.  
                        Is that eleventh grade?

                                 CLOE
                        Just graduated, actually.
                                 JOSH
                        Wow.  You thinking about college?

                                 CLOE
                        What exactly is this article going 
                        to be?  Do you want to know all my 
                        secrets?

                                 JOSH
                        I just think you’re a girl who has 
                        something to say.  Kids your age 
                        never knew a time before the 
                        internet.  The way you talk about 
                        it and use it - I think you kind of 
                        represent what’s going on in your 
                        generation.

                                 CLOE
                        I’m the voice of my generation?

                                 JOSH
                        You’re an interesting voice in your 
                        generation.

                                 CLOE
                             (ala Marge Simpson)
                        Mmmmmm...

                                 JOSH
                        Tell me about these vlogs.  Like, 
                        the one about the internet.

                                 CLOE
                        I was just in a mood.  Sometimes 
                        the internet makes me crazy.  I 
                        love it but I hate it, you know?

                                 JOSH
                        I know.

                                 CLOE
                        I mean, I can be watching a movie, 
                        and like, texting, and checking out 
                        a music site, or blogging, and 
                        updating my Facebook, all at the 
                        same time, and it feels perfectly 
                        normal.  Then it just hits me and 
                        I’m like, “aghh, enough!” and I 
                        want to run outside and roll around 
                        in the grass.

                                 JOSH
                        What do you do?
                                 CLOE
                        I usually run outside and roll 
                        around in the grass.

           Josh laughs.

                                 CLOE
                        It’s just that the world is 
                        literally right at our fingertips 
                        and it’s really cool, but it’s also 
                        completely insane.  I mean, where’s 
                        it gonna go from here, chips in our 
                        brains?

                                 JOSH
                        It is the next logical step.

                                 CLOE
                        I will not have a chip implanted in 
                        my brain.  I refuse.

                                 JOSH
                        You say that now.  If they start 
                        rolling them out, you may just find 
                        yourself the first in line.

           Cloe contemplates this, then realizes Josh is right.

                                 CLOE
                        Oh my god.

                                 JOSH
                        Don’t feel bad.

                                 CLOE
                        No, it’s terrible.

                                 JOSH
                        You want to hear terrible, I’ve all 
                        but completely lost the ability to 
                        write by hand.

                                 CLOE
                        Oh, I know, right?

                                 JOSH
                        I was on a flight to New York and 
                        my laptop battery died, and I was 
                        thinking, “how am I going to get 
                        any work done now?”  Then, I 
                        remembered something...

           Cloe’s curious.  Josh pulls out... a pencil.
                                 CLOE
                        Oooh, freaky.

           She takes it from him and stares at it in mock-wonder.

                                 JOSH
                        You can write a thousand pages with 
                        it, it’s portable and requires no 
                        recharging.

                                 CLOE
                        And it makes an excellent fashion 
                        accessory.

           She puts the pencil in her hair and poses.  Josh smiles.

                                 CLOE
                        See, it’s the simple things right 
                        in front of us that we just don’t 
                        appreciate.  That’s exactly why I 
                        need that roll in the grass.

                                 JOSH
                        You mean you literally roll around 
                        in the grass?

                                 CLOE
                        I’ve taken some of my best pictures 
                        that way...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CLOE’S BACKYARD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Cloe lays on her back on a lush bed of leaf-strewn grass.  
           She points her camera upwards at the treetops.

           THROUGH THE LENS

           Sunlight breaks through two trees whose branches intertwine -- 
           the leaves on one have turned a crisp autumn brown, while the 
           leaves on the other are still in summer-green splendor.  

                                 CLOE’S NARRATION (V.O.)
                        “I love how, just before fall 
                        blooms, it holds hands with summer 
                        first...”

           CLICK - CLICK - CLICK, Cloe’s camera captures her words...
           INT. SUNRISE MALL - C-TOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY (END FLASHBACK)

           Josh nods his approval.

                                 JOSH
                        Nice.

                                 CLOE
                        Why, thank you, sir.

                                 JOSH
                        Do you really like your camera more 
                        than you like most people?

                                 CLOE
                             (laughs)
                        I’m not, like, a hater or anything.  
                        It’s just most of my friends, they 
                        don’t see things the way I do.  
                        They just kind of want to live the 
                        life, you know, the boyfriend, the 
                        ring, the prom.  And that’s cool 
                        for them, but I’m inspired by 
                        different things.

                                 JOSH
                        What inspires you?

                                 CLOE
                        Oh, god, how much time do you have?

           Josh is intrigued.  Cloe rolls things around, then --

                                 CLOE
                        It's so clichéd, but thunderstorms?  
                        The rain; I love that sound.  
                        Especially at, like, three a.m.
                             (beat)
                        Carnivals.  Little kids at 
                        carnivals, the way they laugh.  
                             (beat)
                        Not dusk, but a little before dusk 
                        when everything is just so much 
                        more bright and vivid?  I love that 
                        time of day.

           Josh is fascinated by Cloe’s mind at work.

                                 CLOE
                        Um... the smell of oranges.
                             (beat)
                        When people look graceful smoking 
                        instead of cheap or, like, 
                        hillbilly.
                                 JOSH
                        That inspires you?

                                 CLOE
                        Totally.
                             (beat)
                        You’re a writer, what inspires you?

           Josh tries his best to answer... but nothing comes. 

           Cloe waits.  Josh laughs nervously, then is rescued, when --

           Cloe spots MATT, (17), cute, forward-swept hair and skater 
           slouch, as he enters the coffee shop and looks around.

                                 CLOE
                        Oh, shit.

                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 CLOE
                             (hides behind Josh)
                        There’s just this kid.  Don’t look. 
                        He kind of likes me and I don’t 
                        want to run into him right now.  

           In the distance Matt sends a text.  Cloe’s phone vibrates.

                                 CLOE
                        Shit, shit, he’s texting me.  Can 
                        we leave?  I’ll count to three and 
                        we stand up together and you block 
                        me as go out the back.

                                 JOSH
                        Seriously?

                                 CLOE
                        Please?

                                 JOSH
                        Okay.

           He packs up his things as Cloe peaks over his shoulder.

                                 CLOE
                        On three?

                                 JOSH
                        I got it.

                                 CLOE
                        Okay.  One, two, three.
           Josh and Cloe stand together and make their way out, leaving 
           Matt, in the distance, still searching for Cloe.

           EXT. SUNRISE MALL - C-TOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Josh and Cloe arrive safely on the sidewalk.

                                 CLOE
                        Thanks.

                                 JOSH
                        You know, I had more questions.

                                 CLOE
                        That’s cool.  Just text me, or call 
                        me, or email me, or I.M. me, or hit 
                        me up on Facebook, but not Myspace, 
                        I don’t really check it anymore.

                                 JOSH
                        Right.

           An awkward, but warm, moment passes between them.

                                 JOSH
                        Do you need a ride, or --

                                 CLOE
                        I can walk.  I live close.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay.

                                 CLOE
                        Okay, then.  Bye.

           She turns to leave.

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, hey, Cloe?

           She turns back.

                                 JOSH
                        How’d you get my cell number?

                                 CLOE
                        I’m the voice of my generation, I 
                        have my ways.

           She turns and walks off.  Josh, amused, watches her go.
           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Josh and Lisa sit together on their couch watching a fashion-
           themed reality show.  Lisa’s in sweats with hair up, wearing 
           glasses that she’d never wear anywhere but on that couch.  

           Josh sips a beer.  Lisa digs a spoon into a quart of ice 
           cream, and watches intently as a surly JUDGE berates an 
           emotionally-wrecked CONTESTANT.  

                                 LISA
                             (mouth full)
                        Oh my god, that’s why this show 
                        drives me crazy!  She did not 
                        deserve that.  I liked her dress.  
                        Didn’t you like her dress?

                                 JOSH
                        It was a little showy, and I don’t 
                        have the calves to pull that off.

           Lisa smiles and lovingly elbows Josh.

           TV SCREEN

           The Judge continues his tirade.

                                 JUDGE
                        “What you’ve given us is completely 
                        boring.  It shows no inspiration.”

           LIVING ROOM

           The Judge’s words catch Josh’s attention.

                                 LISA
                             (takes another spoonful)
                        I have got to stop eating this.  
                        They’re going to have to bring me 
                        into the church on a fork lift.

           She looks at Josh for a reaction, but he’s lost in thought.

                                 LISA
                             (play-whining)
                        Honey?  You’re supposed to tell me 
                        that you’d love me no matter what.

                                 JOSH
                        I’d love you no matter what.
                                 LISA
                             (easily pleased)
                        Thank you.

                                 JOSH
                        Lees, lemmee ask you a question.  
                        What inspires you?

                                 LISA
                        What inspires me?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.

                                 LISA
                        To do what?

                                 JOSH
                        Anything.  What makes you want to, 
                        you know, get up and take action?

                                 LISA
                             (trying to be cute)
                        Besides a designer blowout sale?

           Josh rolls his eyes.

                                 LISA
                        I don’t know.  I guess I’m inspired 
                        to plan our wedding.  Why?

           Her attention is drawn back to the TV.

                                 JOSH
                        I just -- you know I’m interviewing 
                        that sixteen-year-old girl?

                                 LISA
                             (eyes still on the TV)
                        Oh, you’re doing that?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.  Cloe.  Bright kid.  We 
                        talked about inspiration and she 
                        came up with some pretty stunning 
                        thoughts, and I’ve been thinking 
                        about it and I can’t think of one 
                        damn thing that inspires me.  There 
                        are things I like, but nothing 
                        that’s like, “wow,” you know?

                                 LISA
                        Josh, she’s a teenage girl.  She 
                        has no concept of the real world.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LISA (CONT'D)
                        She does nothing all day but 
                        gossip, style her hair and listen 
                        to boy bands.  I wouldn’t take 
                        anything she says too seriously.

                                 JOSH
                        Hmm.

                                 LISA
                        God, I would not go back to those 
                        days if you paid me.  The drama.  
                        The uncertainty.
                             (beat)
                        I’m really happy we’re getting 
                        married, babe.  No more wondering 
                        about tomorrow.  No more surprises. 

           She nuzzles to Josh.  He puts his arm around her.  They kiss.  
           Josh tries to kiss her more, but Lisa gently cuts him off, 
           preferring to just cuddle and watch TV.

                                 LISA
                        And we can inspire each other for 
                        the rest of our lives, right?

                                 JOSH
                        Right.  Right, I was just --

                                 LISA
                             (to the TV)
                        No not those shoes!
                             (beat, to Josh)
                        What, hon?

                                 JOSH
                        Nothing.

           Lisa’s engrossed in the show.  Josh is momentarily lost in 
           thought, then his focus, too, returns to the TV.

           INT. CLOE’S HOUSE - CLOE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Cloe, on her bed, music in headphones, taps at her laptop.  
           She scrolls through photos, each a variation of the same shot 
           - her hands held in the shape of a heart, framing the setting 
           sun.  She frowns and deletes them one by one, then --

           Success.  Cloe smiles her approval and opens a photo.  Her 
           eyes darting excitedly, she quickly edits it, making minute 
           but precise changes.  The “hand heart” image glows...
           Suddenly, she closes the picture window and opens a group of 
           web pages of all kinds - photography competitions, arts 
           colleges, film schools, one titled “Careers in Writing.”

           Cloe flips through the pages with growing intensity, when --

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Hey, sweetie.

           Cloe quickly minimizes the screens and addresses her mother.

                                 DONNA
                             (showing off her outfit)
                        What do you think?

                                 CLOE
                        You look cute.

                                 DONNA
                        Yeah?

                                 CLOE
                        Hmm... you wanna try my green top 
                        with that? 

                                 DONNA
                        I knew it.

           She makes her way across Cloe’s room.

                                 DONNA
                        Wouldn’t kill you to pick up this 
                        place.

           Cloe doesn’t respond.

           Donna grabs a pair of jeans, holds them up and assesses them.

                                 DONNA
                        I swear I had a cute little body 
                        like this before I had you.

                                 CLOE
                        You’re still a hot mama, mama.

                                 DONNA
                        Not like I used to be.  But 
                        hopefully enough, tonight.

           Cloe rolls her eyes.

           Donna finds Cloe’s green top, holds it up to herself and 
           waits for Cloe’s reaction...
                                 CLOE
                        Totally.

                                 DONNA
                        Thanks, sweetie.

           She dashes for the door, but stops and turns back --

                                 DONNA
                        Oh, I got that application for you.

                                 CLOE
                        Mom...

                                 DONNA
                        Honey, we’ve talked about this.  
                        Get a Cosmetology License.  You can 
                        start working right away and have 
                        some money in your pocket.  I know 
                        you like to be creative; it’s 
                        creative -- and practical.

                                 CLOE
                        I know.

                                 DONNA
                        And if you get a job at the mall, I 
                        told you, you can live here.  We’ll 
                        be roomies!

                                 CLOE
                        I know.  Thanks, mom.

                                 DONNA
                        Okay, gotta run, wish me luck.

           She leaves before Cloe can respond.  

           Cloe turns her attention back to the open web pages.  Frus-
           trated, she closes them one by one.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Josh is asleep on the couch, the TV his only companion.  He 
           wakes and focusses on the screen - it’s a frantic infomercial 
           for “The Super Shammy.”  Half conscious, he watches...

                                 JOSH
                        It’s just a towel.

           He checks the clock - ‘3:21 am.’  He stands and heads for the 
           bedroom, but stops at his computer and sits.
           COMPUTER AREA

           Josh opens his email and clicks through; delete - delete - 
           delete - delete, then suddenly --

           ‘Bloop,’ an IM pops up.  It’s from Cloe.  Her voice narrates:

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “’Sup?”

           Josh, surprised, types a response.  His voice narrates:

                                 JOSH’S IM
                        “Me.  But not for much longer.  
                        Shouldn’t you be asleep?”

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “Insomniac.”

                                 JOSH’S IM
                        “Sorry.  Warm milk?”

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “Will that counteract a dozen cups 
                        of coffee?”

                                 JOSH’S IM
                        “Probably not.”

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “Drat.”

           Josh smiles, then tries to end the conversation.

                                 JOSH’S IM
                        “Okay, well, good night --”

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “Can I ask you a question?”

                                 JOSH’S IM
                             (some hesitation)
                        “Sure.”

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “How does anyone ever want just one 
                        thing?”

                                 JOSH’S IM
                        “I’m not sure I get what you mean.”
                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “I want to be famous and inspir-
                        ational and unconventionally

                        wants to get married and be a mom

                        Make people feel things, or at 
                        least want to feel things.”

           Josh, a bit taken aback, struggles to respond.

                                 JOSH’S IM
                        “I think it’s good to have a lot of 
                        interests.  I think that makes you 
                        a well-rounded person.”

           Unhappy with his response, he starts to delete it, when --

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “I want to get drunk.  I want to be

                        want to impress, seduce, joke, 
                        party, pray, nap and embrace myself 
                        through every circumstance that 
                        life sends me.”

           Josh is stunned.  And before he can respond --

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “But I'm so afraid that the things 
                        I want in life will always elude 
                        me.  Maybe I want too much, or 
                        maybe it's just that what I want is 
                        too big for a person like me.”

                                 JOSH’S IM
                             (struggling)
                        “Cloe, I think what you’re going 
                        through is normal.”

           He hits “Send,” but again is not happy with his response.

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “Sorry, I’m rambling.  You want to 
                        meet tomorrow?  Finish the 
                        interview?  Same time?”

           Josh can’t seem to think of anything to write, but --

                                 JOSH’S IM
                        “Sure.”
                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “K.  Gonna try to get some shut-
                        eye.  Good night.  :)”

           She signs off.  Josh is more than a little perplexed.  He 
           hits a button and his computer screen goes black.

           EXT. SUNRISE MALL - C-TOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Josh exits his car.  He checks his cell phone, then spots 
           Cloe on a sidewalk bench, coffee in hand, her legs over --

           Matt’s lap.

           Josh stops, self-conscious.  Cloe notices him.  She jumps up, 
           prompting Matt to follow.  

                                 CLOE
                        Josh, this is Matt.

                                 MATT
                        ‘Sup?

                                 JOSH
                        How you doin’?

           He gives Matt and Cloe a minute.  They say goodbye.  Matt 
           skates away.  Cloe turns to Josh and brightens.

                                 CLOE
                        Sorry about that.

                                 JOSH
                        Looks like you two worked it out?

                                 CLOE
                        Ugh, I don’t know.

                                 JOSH
                             (indicates coffee shop)
                        Okay.  You want to --

                                 CLOE
                             (suddenly excited)
                        Can I show you something?

                                 JOSH
                        I was hoping to finish our 
                        interview and --

                                 CLOE
                        This is part of that.  Please?  
                        It’s just this way.
           Josh relents.  Cloe leads him down the sidewalk.

                                 JOSH
                        How many coffees is that today?

                                 CLOE
                        The only thing keeping me awake 
                        right now.

                                 JOSH
                        You know, if you don’t drink so 
                        much of that, you’d sleep more, 
                        then you wouldn’t need to drink so 
                        much of that.  Kind of a circle 
                        thing.

                                 CLOE
                        Really?

           They walk a little further and arrive at a --

           FOOD COURT

           Business people, teens and shoppers of all shapes and sizes 
           eat and mingle at rows of tables.

           Cloe leads Josh to an empty one.  They sit.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay...

           Cloe holds out her empty coffee cup, smiles, and purposely 
           drops it.  She reaches under the table for it.  

           Josh waits, but Cloe doesn’t reappear.

                                 CLOE (O.S.)
                        Down here.

           Josh bends down and finds Cloe, oddly amused with herself.

                                 CLOE
                        Hello.

                                 JOSH
                        How are ya?

                                 CLOE
                        What do you think?

                                 JOSH
                        I think maybe your mom was right 
                        about the ‘dorkish quality.’
                                 CLOE
                        Ha ha.  No, I mean look around.  
                        I noticed this the other day.  
                        Check out all the feet.

           Josh cranes his neck and looks out at the scores of feet in 
           various positions - standing still, walking, rubbing against 
           one another - even one pair looking somehow “confused.”

                                 CLOE
                        People’s feet communicate so much 
                        about them, but in ways no one ever 
                        notices.  They tell a hundred 
                        different stories.  Isn’t it cool?

                                 JOSH
                        It is.  But can we sit up before my 
                        head explodes?

                                 CLOE
                        Sorry.

           They sit up.  Josh gets back to normal as he listens to Cloe.

                                 CLOE
                        I totally want to do a photo study 
                        of just peoples’ feet.  How they 
                        relate to each other.  How unique 
                        and expressive they are.  Don’t you 
                        think that would be interesting...

           But the more she talks, the more serious Josh becomes, till 
           Cloe notices and trails off...

                                 CLOE
                        What?

                                 JOSH
                        What was that IM all about last 
                        night?

                                 CLOE
                        Oh, it was just late and I had way 
                        too much coffee.

                                 JOSH
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        Mmm... no.

           Cloe stops short, then gives Josh her complete attention.

                                 JOSH
                        You’ve got me a little worried 
                        about you.
                                 CLOE
                        How can you be so sure?

                                 JOSH
                        Because it was the middle of the 
                        night and you seemed upset and --

                                 CLOE
                        No, I mean about your life?  Your 
                        job, and you just got engaged and 
                        everything?  How did you know what 
                        you wanted?

           The question grabs Josh.  He considers it, then --

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t think you can ever be 
                        totally sure of anything.  Life 
                        just sort of happens.

                                 CLOE
                        That’s fucking bullshit.

                                 JOSH
                        You, with the mouth!

                                 CLOE
                        No, I’m sorry, but you can live 
                        with that?  “Life just sort of 
                        happens?”

                                 JOSH
                             (convincing himself)
                        Not completely.  My job; I liked 
                        journalism, I studied it in college 
                        and I ended up at a magazine.

                                 CLOE
                        You ever want to do anything else?

                                 JOSH
                             (hesitates)
                        This isn’t exactly the future I’d  
                        envisioned for myself, but I --

                                 CLOE
                        I worry about my future all the 
                        time.  What if I don't accomplish 
                        anything and end up a homeless 
                        failure?  What if I get what I want 
                        and it’s not what I want?
                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, you’ve got time.  You’ll go 
                        to college; experience all kinds of 
                        new things.  You’ll figure it out.

           Cloe doesn’t answer.  She looks out at the various groups of 
           PARENTS and CHILDREN seated around her.

                                 CLOE
                        All these happy, clichéd, content 
                        people.  I want to strangle them 
                        for being so unrealistic.  Maybe 
                        they really are happy; I don't 
                        understand how they can be, though.  
                        Maybe they're just really good at 
                        faking it.

           Josh laughs.

                                 CLOE
                        What?

                                 JOSH
                        I have friends who married right 
                        out of college.  Now, they have 
                        lives like these people.  They say 
                        they’re happy, but they’ve always 
                        said they envied me.  I was ‘free.’

                                 CLOE
                        When you get married you won’t be 
                        free anymore.

                                 JOSH
                             (uneasy)
                        You make your choices in life.

                                 CLOE
                        Then you’re happy you’re 
                        marrying...?

                                 JOSH
                        Lisa.  Yeah.  Yes.  Absolutely.
                             (grabs list of questions)
                        Okay, so --

                                 CLOE
                        And how did you know you wanted to 
                        get married?

                                 JOSH
                             (hesitates, struggles)
                        We’ve been together a long time.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        Lisa’s great, and, and there’s no 
                        reason we shouldn’t get married.

           Beat - a moment of tense silence passes.

                                 CLOE
                             (not at all convinced)
                        Oh.  Well, great.

           She looks around awkwardly.

           Josh notices this.  He struggles with his thoughts.  His 
           frustration builds, then, exasperated --

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, I’m an adult!

                                 CLOE
                        Meaning?

                                 JOSH
                        Meaning I’m much older than you 
                        are.  And, and, and things, things
                        are different, more complicated 
                        when you’re an adult, in ways I, I 
                        just can’t explain.

                                 CLOE
                        Can’t explain to me, or can’t 
                        explain at all?

                                 JOSH
                        Agh!

                                 CLOE
                        I’m sorry, but you just don’t 
                        really sound that sure of things.

                                 JOSH
                        Well, I am.  I’m one-hundred 
                        percent sure.  I’m perfectly happy 
                        and I didn’t mean to give the 
                        impression that I’m not.

                                 CLOE
                        Okay --

                                 JOSH
                        Okay!

                                 CLOE
                        I’m sorry --
                                 JOSH
                        No, it’s fine!

           Beat.

                                 CLOE
                        Fine.

           At last, mercifully, a moment of calm descends over them.

                                 CLOE
                        Guess we better get back to my 
                        vlogs - your big exposé on the 
                        typical teenage mind?

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, ‘typical’ is the last word I 
                        would use to describe you.

           Cloe’s proud of herself.  Josh smiles.

           EXT. CLEVELAND - DAY

           The summer sun beats down on the bustling Ohio city.

           INT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - JOSH’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Josh taps at his computer.

                                 JOSH’S SCREEN
                        “Warhol could never have dreamed 
                        how right he’d be.  But his aim was 
                        too low.  In the era of social 
                        networking, when a teenage girl’s 
                        creativity has instant global 
                        reach, everyone is famous... all 
                        the time --”

           EXPLODING LAUGHTER distracts Josh.  He looks up.  Mike and 
           some GUYS convulse at a nearby computer.  He sighs, then --

           ‘Bloop,’ an IM pops up.  It’s from Cloe.  Her voice narrates:

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “’Sup?”

           Josh, smiles and types a response.  His voice narrates:

                                 JOSH’S IM
                        “Hello.”
                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “How’s the article coming?  Need 
                        any more teen angst?”

                                 JOSH’S IM
                        “I think I’ve got it covered.”

           A few moments pass while he awaits a response, then --

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “Does that mean I’ll never see you 
                        again?”

           Josh considers this a moment, then Cloe elaborates --

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “:(”

           Josh frowns.  He looks around at his office and his cackling 
           office mates, then back at the “:(” on his screen... then --

                                 JOSH’S IM
                        “You hungry?”

           EXT. WESTSIDE MARKET - DAY

           In a cavernous late-Victorian structure, it’s endless stalls 
           of fresh produce, baked goods, meats, wines, and imports.

           Josh and Cloe bustle through the lunchtime crowds.  

           Cloe’s dazzled by this feast for the eyes and palette.

                                 CLOE
                        This is my new favorite place!

                                 JOSH
                        Westside Market.  Been here a 
                        hundred years and you’ve only 
                        discovered it now.

                                 CLOE
                        Thanks to you.

           She squeezes his arm.

                                 JOSH
                        I worked here every summer all 
                        through high school.

           Cloe produces her camera and starts snapping pictures.
                                 CLOE
                        God, I feel like I’m in Europe!

                                 JOSH
                        You’ve been to Europe?

                                 CLOE
                        Only on Google Earth.

           Josh considers this a moment, then stops abruptly and grabs 
           Cloe by the shoulders --

                                 JOSH
                        Here.  Close your eyes...

                                 CLOE
                        What, why -- 

                                 JOSH
                        Just do it.

           Cloe closes her eyes, self-conscious but excited.

                                 JOSH
                        Now.  Open your ears, and listen...

           Cloe raises her chin, and hears --

           OLD LADIES gossip openly in Italian; a MERCHANT hawks passion-
           ately in Spanish; a SALESMAN haggles angrily in Russian...

                                 JOSH
                             (whispers in her ear)
                        Better than Google Earth?

                                 CLOE
                        Totally.

           She keeps listening...

           LATER

           They walk, enjoying fresh baguettes with cheese and fruit.  

                                 JOSH
                        You ever think of studying 
                        overseas?  Foreign exchange 
                        program?  It’d be a great start on 
                        that long list of things you want.

                                 CLOE
                             (shrugs)
                        Well, my mom wants me to get a 
                        cosmetology license.
                                 JOSH
                        A cosmetology license?

                                 CLOE
                        Yeah, I mean, I have to be 
                        practical, right?

                                 JOSH
                        No.  No, you don’t. 

           He stops and faces Cloe.  She really listens.

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, you’re sixteen years old and 
                        you’re brilliant.  You can do 
                        whatever you want to do.  Practical 
                        is the last thing you should be.

           A cautiously hopeful smile spreads across Cloe’s face.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - COMPUTER AREA - NIGHT

           By dim light, Josh researches web sites for student arts 
           grants, scholarships, foreign study programs, etc.

           Lisa, in night clothes, walks by.

                                 LISA
                        You coming to bed, hon?

                                 JOSH
                             (not looking up)
                        Mmm...

                                 LISA
                        What are you doing?

                                 JOSH
                        College research for Cloe.

                                 LISA
                        Cloe?  You still writing that?

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, no, finished it last week.  I’m 
                        just trying to help her out.  She’s 
                        really talented.

                                 LISA
                             (bothered)
                        Yeah.  You’ve mentioned that.
                                 JOSH
                        I’ll be in in a minute.

                                 LISA
                        Um... okay.

           Lisa, now a little annoyed, walks off.  Josh keeps working.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Cloe and Josh sit on a bench together, enjoying the sun.

                                 CLOE
                        I think about death a lot.

           Josh shoots her a stunned look.

                                 CLOE
                        It’s not the dying that bothers me 
                        so much, it’s the thought of not 
                        being alive anymore.  I’d really 
                        miss the world.

                                 JOSH
                        You realize you’ve got maybe 
                        another sixty or seventy years?

                                 CLOE
                        Maybe.  Maybe five minutes.

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, you can’t live your life 
                        worry about death all the time.

                                 CLOE
                        Not all the time.  But some of the 
                        time.  So I don’t waste time.

           Josh considers Cloe’s words.

           INT. ST. JOHN’S CATHEDRAL - ANOTHER DAY

           Josh and Cloe sit in a pew and stare up at a magnificent 
           round stained glass window.  They whisper...

                                 CLOE
                        So, you don't believe in God at 
                        all?

                                 JOSH
                        Of course not.
                                 CLOE
                        Okay, not the guy in the robe with 
                        the beard, but you don’t think 
                        there’s at least some kind of 
                        something out there?

                                 JOSH
                        Nope.

                                 CLOE
                        Wait, in an infinite universe and 
                        an infinite amount of time, there 
                        is no magic?  Not one bit?

                                 JOSH
                        Sorry.

                                 CLOE
                        That’s retarded.  And sad.

                                 JOSH
                        Spoken with true religious 
                        compassion.

           Cloe has no answer.  Nice.  They gaze back up at the window.

           EXT. WATERFRONT - ANOTHER DAY

           Josh and Cloe lean on a railing and look out at Lake Erie.

                                 CLOE
                        High school felt like everyone was 
                        moving at a regular speed, and I 
                        was on a completely different 
                        track; thinking strange thoughts.  
                        Like I was just sitting somewhere 
                        watching all of these normal people 
                        live.  Does that sound weird?

                                 JOSH
                        No.  I’ve never been much of a 
                        joiner.  It used to get me 
                        frustrated, like there was 
                        something wrong with me.  I finally 
                        just accepted that I don’t connect 
                        with most people.  

                                 CLOE
                        Just weird teenage girls?

           Josh “seriously” contemplates Cloe for a moment.
                                 JOSH
                        Well, one anyway.

           Cloe elbows Josh - he smiles back at her.  

           A warm, comfortable moment passes between the two of them.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

           Josh and Lisa sit with a well-groomed WEDDING PLANNER who 
           shows them color swatches, invitations, etc.  

           Lisa is enthralled.  Josh is... not.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - STORAGE CLOSET - NIGHT

           Josh searches through boxes of memories - photos, letters, 
           vinyl albums, vhs tapes.

           He finds his high school yearbook: “Impressions: 1991.”  He 
           smiles at inscriptions like, “You’re gonna do it, man!”, “The 
           best!” and “See you in Hollywood, dude!”  

           He turns to “Sports,” and is pleased to discover numerous 
           shots of a gleeful, triumphant Josh Bennett, Basketball Star.

           EXT. PARK - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

           Josh shoots free-throws.  A bit rusty, he eventually hits 
           one, then another, and another.

           He attempts a lay-up, hits it, then a few more moves till 
           he’s happily sweating and really getting into his old groove.

           INT. CLOE’S HOUSE - CLOE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Cloe scrolls through her Westside Market photos - the stalls, 
           the produce, one of her laughing, holding a squirming 
           lobster, one of Josh mugging for the camera.

           Her cell phone rings.  She checks it.  The screen flashes 
           “MATT.”  She hits the button marked “DENY.”

           Returning to her computer, she moves the images together so 
           she and Josh are side by side.  Then, Cloe smiles...

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lisa gets ready for a night out.  Josh enters.
                                 JOSH
                        Why are you getting dressed?

                                 LISA
                        Because we need to leave in twenty 
                        minutes.

                                 JOSH
                        Shit, that party’s tonight?

                                 LISA
                        Yes it is.

           Josh rushes into the bathroom.  As Lisa shakes her head, 
           “BLING” - Josh’s phone goes off.

                                 LISA
                        Josh, your phone!

           He emerges from the bathroom, grabs it.  It’s from Cloe:

                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “Totally bored.  Wanna chat?”

           Josh smiles a little and closes the phone.

                                 LISA
                        Who was that?

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe.

                                 LISA
                        Josh, what is going on with you and 
                        that girl?

                                 JOSH
                        What do you mean by that?

                                 LISA
                        I mean you’re hanging around with a 
                        sixteen year-old girl. 

                                 JOSH
                        I’m not ‘hanging around’ with her.  
                        She’s, she’s just, she’s a nice 
                        girl, she’s kind of an outsider, 
                        it’s, it’s nothing.

                                 LISA
                        It’s not nothing, it’s inappro-
                        priate and weird, and I’m sure 
                        you’re giving her the wrong idea.

                        Hurry up, we have to go.

                                 JOSH
                        Lisa!

           She doesn’t respond.  Josh is left hanging.

           INT. CLOE’S HOUSE - CLOE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Cloe lays on her bed, not happy.  She checks her phone.  
           Nothing.  Frustrated, she tosses it aside, when --

           “BLING” - a incoming text.  She grabs it, opens it:

                                 MATT’S TEXT
                        “Party at Jake’s tonight.  You in?”

           Cloe’s disappointed, but responds:

                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “Sure.”

           INT. LOFT PARTY - NIGHT

           ADULTS (20’s-40’s) party in an upscale space.  Despite the 
           red wine and hors d’oeuvres, it’s a pretty raucous scene.

           Josh, beer in hand, mingles.  He looks over at --

           Lisa, with a nearly-empty wine glass and laughing a little 
           too hard.  Clearly, she’s had a few.  Josh is concerned.

           INT. BASEMENT PARTY - NIGHT

           TEENAGERS carouse amid wood paneling, old couches and a keg.

           Cloe sits, drinking with Matt.  His arm’s around her.  She 
           looks a little uneasily at the boisterous crowd.

           Someone sets up cups for a game of beer-pong.

           Beer is then poured into the cups, but these cups are not at 
           the teenagers’ party.  They’re at --

           INT. ADULT LOFT PARTY - NIGHT

           It’s an identical setup for beer-pong.

           Josh watches, rolling his eyes as the Adults start to play.

           END SERIES OF SHOTS

           INT. BASEMENT PARTY - NIGHT

           Matt leans in to kiss Cloe.  She kisses him back, then, she 
           feels a vibration and reaches for her phone.  A new text:

                                 JOSH’S TEXT
                        “Sorry.  First chance to talk.  
                        What’s up?”

                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “nm.  u?”

           Matt, annoyed by Cloe’s texting, gets up and storms off.

           INT. LOFT PARTY - NIGHT

           Josh looks out at the Adults around the beer-pong table.

                                 JOSH’S TEXT
                        “Just another mature evening.

           Cloe looks out at the Teenagers around the beer-pong table.

                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “Tell me about it.  imy.”

                        “imy?”

                        “I miss you.”

           Josh can’t help but smile at this.

           Lisa spots Josh.  Her face drops; she just knows who he’s 
           texting.  She downs her glass of wine.  Josh keeps texting.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s late.  Josh and Lisa enter.  Lisa is very drunk.  Josh 
           is, too, but nowhere near Lisa’s condition.  

           Josh puts down his keys and cell phone.  Lisa notices.

                                 LISA
                        You don’t want to leave your phone 
                        there, you might get a text from 
                        your little girlfriend.

                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 LISA
                        I saw you tonight.  You looked like 
                        a child, it was embarrassing.

                                 JOSH
                        Nice.

                                 LISA
                        Are you trying to fuck that girl, 
                        Josh?  One last shot before you 
                        settle down, finally?

                                 JOSH
                        Wow, you are really drunk.

                                 LISA
                        No, I’m serious.  Why else would 
                        you be talking to her so much?  I 
                        know it’s not the conversation.

                                 JOSH
                        I told you, Cloe’s a friend.  She’s 
                        got nothing going for her but her 
                        brains, and I just want her to have 
                        a chance at something more.

                                 LISA
                        More than what?
                                 JOSH
                        More than settling for life in this 
                        crummy little city.

                                 LISA
                        Is that what you’re doing?  Are you 
                        ‘settling’ with me?

                                 JOSH
                        You’re not listening to me.  You 
                        never listen to me.

                                 LISA
                        No, I want to know, are you?

                                 JOSH
                        Lisa, go to bed.

                                 LISA
                        Because, don’t think I haven’t ever 
                        doubted this relationship --

                        Lisa, go to bed!

           Beat.

                                 LISA
                        Fine.

           Lisa shuffles out.  Josh, annoyed, watches her go.

           BATHROOM

           Josh splashes water on his face, then catches his reflection - 
           a pensive moment.  He starts to pull off his shirt, when --

           “BLING” - his phone announces a new text.  He hears it.

           LIVING ROOM

           The phone flashes.  Josh picks it up - it’s from Cloe:

                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “I really, really need to see you.  
                        Please call me?”

           Josh, alarmed, quickly moves to a quiet corner and dials...
           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Cloe, drunk, disheveled and crying answers her phone.

                        What happened?

                                 CLOE
                        Can you come get me?

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, it’s three in the morning --

                                 CLOE
                        Please, I really need you.  Please?

           Josh hears Cloe’s desperation.  He wrestles with it, then --

           EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT

           Cloe sits huddled.  Josh pulls up.  

           INT. JOSH’S CAR - NIGHT (PARKED)

           Cloe shuffles into the passenger seat.  And before Josh can 
           say a word, she hugs him - and doesn’t want to let go.

                                 JOSH
                        Come on, come on, Cloe, what is it?

                                 CLOE
                        It’s nothing.

                                 JOSH
                        Nothing?  You just called me 
                        desperate in the middle of the 
                        night.

           Cloe grabs his hand, making him a little uncomfortable.
                                 CLOE
                        It’s Matt.  I just... 

                                 JOSH
                        What happened?

                                 CLOE
                        We were at that party and we were 
                        making out, and it was getting 
                        pretty hot and heavy and -- he 
                        really wants to have sex with me...

           Josh is suddenly very self-conscious.

                                 JOSH
                        You know you don’t have to do 
                        anything with anybody that you 
                        don’t want to do, and no one has 
                        the right to force you to --

                                 CLOE
                        Oh, no, no, Matt didn’t try to 
                        force me.  It’s just that I feel 
                        bad, I mean, I think you and I have 
                        become really close, and, I, I 
                        just, I don’t...

           Josh touches her cheek and she looks up at him.

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, if you like Matt, it’s okay.

                                 CLOE
                        No.  No, you don’t understand.  
                        It’s not that I don’t want to sleep 
                        with Matt.  I’ve been thinking 
                        about this a lot, and I... I really 
                        want to sleep with you.

           Boom.  Josh freezes.  His heart does a lay-up in his chest.  

           Cloe moves toward him, rising to her knees.  

           Josh still doesn’t move.  

           Cloe gets closer and closer, then --

           They kiss... a kiss that lingers at tender, but as it starts 
           to get passionate, Josh pushes Cloe away.  

                                 JOSH
                        Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, Cloe, no, 
                        this is, this is a really bad idea.
                                 CLOE
                        I think about you a lot.

           Josh shoots her a look - half afraid, half... not.

                                 JOSH
                        I think about you, too.

                                 CLOE
                        Do you want to sleep with me?

                                 JOSH
                        Whoa, I, you know, we shouldn’t 
                        even -- this is just -- Cloe!

                                 CLOE
                        Would you kiss me again?  Please?

           Josh locks eyes with Cloe.  A moment, then --

           They kiss again, this time even more heated, till --

           Again, Josh pushes Cloe away and they fall backwards, winded.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, now that’s it!  Let’s just, 
                        hold on a second!  This is crazy.  
                        I could -- this is illegal.

                                 CLOE
                        False.

                                 JOSH
                        No, no, I’m pretty sure, this is --

           Cloe pulls her phone from her coat and starts punching keys.  
           Josh looks at her, curious.  She holds up the phone:

                             (reads)
                        “No person over the age of eighteen 
                        shall engage in sexual conduct with 
                        a person who is less than sixteen 
                        years of age.”

           Josh’s eyes go wide.  He grabs the cell phone and reads...

                                 JOSH
                        Jesus, don’t mess with the internet 
                        generation.
                                 CLOE
                        It’s actually sixteen in thirty-one 
                        states.

                                 JOSH
                        No shit?

           Cloe stares directly at Josh - her resolve, firm.  

                                 CLOE
                        Josh, the law says I can do what I 
                        want to do.  I know what I want to 
                        do.  What do you want to do?

           Josh tries to respond, but can only look down into Cloe’s 
           big, adorable eyes for one long fevered moment, then --

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, no.

                                 CLOE
                        Yeah.

           Josh grabs her - and the real kissing begins, as --

                                 CLOE’S NARRATION (V.O.)
                        “A first kiss is never just a kiss.  
                        It's the most intimate thing two 
                        people can share.  The details.  
                        The electric thrill.  It's the type 
                        of moment that, no matter who you 
                        are, makes you feel revived.”

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - JOSH’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Josh sits, lost in thought.  He obsessively checks and 
           rechecks web sites for age of consent in Ohio - sixteen, 
           without a doubt, sixteen.  And just as he breathes easier --

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Boy, you really nailed that girl!

           Josh has a minor heart attack.  Mike appears at his cubical.

                                 JOSH
                        Mike!

                                 MIKE
                        I finally got around to reading 
                        your vlog piece.  You surprised me. 
                                 JOSH
                        Oh, yeah, I know you said you 
                        wanted it to be about co-eds --

                                 MIKE
                        No, it’s great.  That girl, Cloe, 
                        is the new millennium teenager.  
                        She’s exactly where our world is at 
                        right now.  I think it’s some of 
                        your best work.

                                 JOSH
                        Really?

                                 MIKE
                        It’s also completely useless.

           Josh’s face drops.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry, buddy, but you profiled a 
                        sixteen year-old girl.  I mean, our 
                        readers are horny bastards, but 
                        they’re not perverts.  Okay, maybe 
                        they are perverts, but we don’t 
                        need to encourage them, you know?

                                 JOSH
                        Sure.

                                 MIKE
                        Great writing, though.  Maybe you 
                        should start your own blog.

                                 JOSH
                        Maybe.

                                 MIKE
                             (he walks off)
                        Woo-hoo. Sixteen!  Hot potato!

           Josh, still numb, watches him go, when --

           ‘Bloop,’ a new email grabs his attention.  It’s from Lisa.  
           He opens it.  In Lisa’s voice:

                                 LISA’S EMAIL
                        “The secretary says you’re not in, 
                        and your phone must be off.  I woke 
                        up this morning and you weren’t 
                        here?  Please call.  I love you.”

           Josh stares at the words, the guilt pangs rising.
           He turns on his phone, and the messages ring in.  He scrolls 
           through Lisa’s texts till he reaches a string of Cloe’s:

                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “I’m still dizzy.”

           Another:

                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “I’m free after 3.”

           Then, another:

                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “Or, whenever you want me.”

           Josh looks sick.  He hits “reply” and starts texting...

           INT. SUNRISE MALL - C-TOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Cloe stares out the window, serene and daydreaming.  After a 
           moment, she spots Josh on the sidewalk.  He comes in.

           Cloe leaps up and kisses him.  Josh pushes her down and sits.

                                 CLOE
                        I can’t stop thinking about last 
                        night.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.  Listen Cloe, last night was,  
                        I just, it was a mistake, okay?  I 
                        was a little drunk and you were a 
                        little more than drunk and I just -- 
                        I cannot tell you how sorry I am.

                                 CLOE
                        Why?

                                 JOSH
                        You’re a great girl and I’ve really 
                        enjoyed the time we’ve spent 
                        together, but that was absolutely 
                        not what I intended.  I’d never 
                        want to hurt you in any way.

                                 CLOE
                        Josh, I’m fine, you didn’t hurt me.
                             (a sly smile)
                        Well, maybe a little...

                                 JOSH
                        Please!  Can we not -- okay?
                                 CLOE
                        Okay.

                                 JOSH
                             (leans in close)
                        Wait, was that -- was that your 
                        first time?

                                 CLOE
                        Are you kidding?

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, yeah, of course, I’m sorry.  
                        So, so you were a... a virgin?

                                 CLOE
                             (off his look - he wasn’t 
                              kidding)
                        No!  Josh, I had my first boyfriend 
                        when I was fourteen.  I’ve had sex 
                        hundreds of times!

                                 JOSH
                             (his face drops)
                        Hundreds?

                                 CLOE
                        Well, it was with the same person, 
                        but it was, like, almost every day 
                        for over a year, so, yeah, it could 
                        be hundreds.

                                 JOSH
                        Why’d you break up, he have a heart 
                        attack?

           Cloe laughs.  Josh starts to breathe more easily.

                                 CLOE
                        Umm... did it seem like it was my 
                        first time?

                                 JOSH
                        Actually, no.

           Cloe beams with pride.

                                 JOSH
                        Will you stop?

           Cloe rolls her eyes.

                                 JOSH
                        So, you really are fine?
                                 CLOE
                        Yes, stop torturing yourself.  I 
                        really like you, Josh.  I’d been 
                        thinking about it for a while, and 
                        I’m glad it happened.
                             (beat)
                        Are you sorry it happened?

                                 JOSH
                        I’m engaged.

                                 CLOE
                        Oh, yeah.  You should break up with 
                        her.

                                 JOSH
                        Why, so we can run off together?

           Cloe smirks.

                                 JOSH
                             (struggles)
                        Cloe, this is just not a good 
                        situation.  Last night was --

                                 CLOE
                        Mind-blowing.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, yes, it was.  But there are 
                        about fifty reasons it was also a 
                        mistake.  It can’t happen again.  
                        I mean, what’s wrong with me?  
                        You’re sixteen.  I’ve got emails 
                        older than you.  

                                 CLOE
                        Nothing’s wrong with you.  We 
                        connect, you said it yourself.  
                        Okay, so don’t break up with Lisa.  
                        Don’t.  Stay with her.  Get married 
                        if you want, but don’t tell me last 
                        night wasn’t something special. 

                                 JOSH
                             (really struggles)
                        It was.  But it can’t happen again.

                                 CLOE
                        It can if you want it to.  It can 
                        happen right now... if you want.

           Josh stares at Cloe, his attraction to her is as intense as 
           his conflicted feelings...
           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Josh and Cloe lay in bed.  They’ve had sex... again.  Now, in 
           the stillness, Cloe hugs Josh as he strokes her hair.

                                 CLOE
                        How did you want it to go?

                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 CLOE
                        Your life.  You said that you 
                        weren’t living the life that you’d 
                        thought you would.  What was the 
                        life you wanted?

                                 JOSH
                        I almost can’t remember.  For a 
                        while I wanted to be an actor.

                                 CLOE
                        An actor?  Really?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, can you see that?

                                 CLOE
                        I totally can, you’re so cute.

           Cloe kisses Josh.

                                 JOSH
                        I was gonna be a musician, but I 
                        couldn’t play anything.  Maybe a 
                        pilot, or an archeologist, or both, 
                        I had big plans.

                                 CLOE
                        Sounds like it.  What stopped you?

                                 JOSH
                        That would be the question.

                                 CLOE
                        Life just ‘sort of happened?’

           She stares into Josh’s eyes.  He studies her face.

                                 JOSH
                        You’re so pretty.

           Cloe blushes.
                                 JOSH
                        No, really, you are.

           Cloe puts her head back on Josh’s chest.

                                 JOSH
                        What am I gonna do?

                                 CLOE
                        About what?

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, I don’t know.  About the fact 
                        that I’m a felon in nineteen 
                        states, and that I’m supposed to 
                        get married, but all I want to do 
                        is stay here in this bed with you.

                                 CLOE
                        I told you, don’t leave Lisa, just 
                        see me.  You can still get married.  
                        This’ll just be us.  Just for now.  
                        No one ever has to know. 

           Josh can’t help but consider Cloe’s words...

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Josh comes in.  He looks exhausted.  Lisa’s been waiting. 

                                 LISA
                        Josh!

           She runs to him - a cautious hug.

                                 JOSH
                        Hey.

                                 LISA
                        I was so worried.  Where were you?  

                                 JOSH
                        I just needed to clear my head.

                                 LISA
                        I’m sorry about what I said, I was 
                        drunk.  I couldn’t understand about 
                        Cloe, but it wasn’t fair of me to 
                        jump to conclusions.  I trust you.  
                        Completely.

           Josh doesn’t respond; how could he?
           They sit on the couch.

                                 LISA
                        Do you forgive me?

                                 JOSH
                             (really squirming)
                        Oh.  Yeah, don’t worry about it.  
                        I can see how you would have gotten 
                        the wrong idea.  It’s probably not 
                        a good thing for me to be... 
                        talking to Cloe so much.

                                 LISA
                        I just think you need to be 
                        careful, you know?  I mean, you 
                        don’t want anyone thinking you’re 
                        some kind of pervert.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, right.

           A cautious, awkward moment passes between them.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Josh brushes his teeth, then catches his reflection in the 
           mirror.  He stares at himself, his toothbrush slowing...

                                 JOSH
                        I’m evil.

           INT. CLOE’S HOUSE - CLOE’S ROOM - DAY

           Cloe lays on her bed, blissfully happy.  She places her hand 
           on her chest, presses down slightly and closes her eyes.

                                 CLOE’S NARRATION (V.O.)
                        “I'm just filled to the brim with 
                        life.  I wish I could take this 
                        feeling and put it in a pill, and 
                        give it to everyone I meet.”

           INT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - JOSH’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Josh, distracted, tries to get some work done, when --

           ‘BLOOP’ - a new email pops in.  It’s from Cloe.  It’s titled 
           “Research Material.”  Curious, Josh opens it to reveal --

           A picture of Cloe in skimpy underwear, posing seductively.
           Josh jumps, knocks his mouse off his desk.  As he bends down 
           to get it, the picture remains on the screen --

           Vince approaches and talks while looking at some papers.

                                 VINCE
                        Hey, Josh do you --

           Josh pops up without the mouse.  Vince looks at him.

                                 VINCE
                        Uh-oh.  You’ve got the eyes.

                                 JOSH
                        What eyes?

                                 VINCE
                        Porn eyes.

                                 JOSH
                        What?  That’s ridiculous.

           Josh glances at the picture still on the screen.

                                 VINCE
                        Please.  You think you’re talking 
                        to an amateur?
                             (tries to see)
                        Can I take a look?

           Josh grabs his monitor and shields it from Vince.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, okay, you got me!

                                 VINCE
                        Fine, hog it for yourself.  But be 
                        smart about these things.  Porn is 
                        the reason the Lord made flash 
                        drives.

                                 JOSH
                        Thanks for the tip.

           Vince holds up a hand to say, “don’t mention it,” puts a 
           finger to his lips indicating, “silence,” throws up the 
           universal “okay” sign - then struts off.  

           Josh finally retrieves his mouse and closes the picture.

           INT. SUNRISE MALL - PARKING LOT - JOSH’S CAR - DAY (PARKED)

           Josh waits.  He looks stressed.  
           Through the car windows, everywhere he looks there seem to be 
           TEENAGERS - walking, laughing, talking, texting, etc.  

           He frowns, checks the time, then --

                                 CLOE (O.S.)
                        Hi, old man!

           Josh is startled.  Cloe opens the door and jumps in.  Her 
           glowing face puts him more at ease.

                                 JOSH
                        Hello, um, young lady.

                                 CLOE
                        You get my present?

                                 JOSH
                        You trying to get me fired?

                                 CLOE
                        I hate to tell you but there’s way 
                        more where that came from!

           She beams.  Josh shakes his head and starts his car.

           INT. MOTEL OFFICE - DAY

           A jaded CLERK watches an uneasy Josh count out cash.

                                 CLERK
                        I can just charge the same card?

                                 JOSH
                        Uh... no, cash is fine.

           The Clerk tries to glance past Josh to see who’s with him.  
           Josh sees this and gives the Clerk a look. 

                                 CLERK
                        You know, we have weekly rates.

           Josh says nothing, signs the receipt, then, after a thought --

                                 JOSH
                        How much?

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Josh and Cloe enter calmly.  But as Josh shuts the door --

           Cloe leaps into his arms and they kiss and fall onto the bed.
           INT. JOSH’S CAR - DAY (MOVING)

           Josh and Cloe hold hands as he drives.  

           Josh looks down at Cloe, she flashes her ‘cheesy smile.’

                                 JOSH
                        You’re a very interesting girl, you 
                        know that?

                                 CLOE
                        I’m your girl.

           They share a warm moment, but... although Cloe doesn’t see, 
           Josh suddenly seems worried.

                                 CLOE
                        Oh, can we stop at my school?

                                 JOSH
                        Your, your high school?

                                 CLOE
                        Yeah, it’s not too far.  I need to 
                        pick up some stuff I left there. 

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, I need to get home.

                                 CLOE
                        It’ll just take a minute.

           Josh is not too happy about the idea, but relents.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Josh’s car pulls in past the bleachers, sports fields, etc.

           INT. JOSH’S CAR - DAY (PARKED)

           Josh is clearly uneasy.  Cloe spots this and smiles.

                                 CLOE
                        Okay, be right back.
                             (pecks him on the cheek)
                        Don’t hit on any of my friends!

                                 JOSH
                        Wow, you’re hilarious.

           Cloe jumps out.  Josh sinks into his seat. 
           A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Josh checks the time.  He frowns.  He opens his phone, tries 
           to send Cloe a text, but the screen reads, “unable to send.”

           Annoyed, he hops out of his car.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           It’s deserted - just Josh surrounded by the icons of high 
           school; trophies, student photos, colorful banners, etc.

           He runs his hand along row of lockers and stops at an open 
           one - its door is adorned with cut-outs from teen magazines, 
           stickers, a mirror, etc.  

           He catches himself in the mirror a moment, then --

                                 FEMALE TEACHER (O.S.)
                        Can I help you?

           Josh, startled, closes the locker door to reveal a FEMALE 
           TEACHER, 30’s, plain-but-pleasant, facing him.

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, uh, no.  No, I’m, just waiting 
                        for, for a student.  She’s --

                                 FEMALE TEACHER
                        Which student?

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, uh, Cloe Vardis.

                                 FEMALE TEACHER
                        Oh, Cloe!  Wonderful girl.  
                        Brilliant.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, she’s really something.

                                 FEMALE TEACHER
                        You must be so proud of her, 
                        graduating a year early!

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, OH!  No, no, I’m not -- I’m 
                        just a, just a friend.

           He speeds past the Female Teacher, who, curious, watches him.

                                 FEMALE TEACHER
                        Oh.  Well.
           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The clock reads “3:45 am.”  Josh lays wide awake.  He stares 
           guiltily at Lisa sleeping next to him...

           COMPUTER AREA

           By the dim light of the monitor Josh works at his computer...

           INT. JOSH’S CAR - DAY (PARKED)

           Josh waits; he’s tense.  

           Cloe opens the door and jumps in next to him.  He relaxes 
           some.  They kiss.

                                 CLOE
                        So, what’s my surprise?

           Josh produces a thick manila envelope.

           Cloe opens it.  It’s applications for schools like The Rhode 
           Island School of Design, Chicago Art Institute, NYU, The 
           London Art College, and The Sorbonne.  

           Cloe is stunned, then, her eyes fill with tears.  

                                 CLOE
                        Josh...

                                 JOSH
                        Those are applications for the best 
                        art colleges in the world, Cloe.  
                        You belong at one of those places.

                                 CLOE
                        You really think so?

                                 JOSH
                        They’d be lucky to have you.

                                 CLOE
                        But how am I gonna --

                                 JOSH
                        I’ll help you every step of the 
                        way.  Essays, recommendations, 
                        whatever.  There’s a real good 
                        chance you can get a scholarship.  
                        You can do this.
           Cloe grabs Josh and holds him tight.  She’s happy, but a 
           little sad, too.  

           Josh holds her; he feels the same.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Josh and Cloe lay in bed.  Cloe faces away from him, 
           breathing softly.  Josh lightly touches her hair.  He’s 
           concerned.  Cloe, too, looks worried.

                                 CLOE
                        Why do you think you never got 
                        married before now?

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe...

                                 CLOE
                        I’m just curious.

           Josh considers.

                                 JOSH
                        I was waiting for the right time.

                                 CLOE
                        What about the right person?

                                 JOSH
                        Do you really want to have this 
                        conversation?

                                 CLOE
                        She doesn’t make you feel the way I 
                        make you feel.

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe...

           She rolls over to face Josh.

                                 CLOE
                        Why?  Why would you and me be so 
                        impossible?

                                 JOSH
                        You’re sixteen?

                                 CLOE
                        You keep saying that.  But it 
                        doesn’t mean anything.
                                 JOSH
                        It means this situation is 
                        impossible.  Be practical.

           Cloe’s shocked by that last word, but calms...

                                 CLOE
                        She doesn’t make you feel the way I 
                        make you feel.

           She jumps out of bed.  Josh wants to speak, but can’t.

           EXT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Josh walks to his car and stops short when he sees --

           Matt, skateboard in hand, leaning against his car.

                                 MATT
                             (nervous)
                        ‘Sup?

                                 JOSH
                             (ALSO nervous)
                        ‘Sup?

                                 MATT
                        You’re Mr. Bennett, right?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, that’s right, uh, call me 
                        Josh.  Matt, right?
                             (beat)
                        How’d you know I work here?

                                 MATT
                        Googled you.

                                 JOSH
                        Of course.

                                 MATT
                        So, like, you’re, like, friends 
                        with Cloe, right?

                                 JOSH
                        Well, I, I interviewed her for an 
                        article.  It didn’t work out, but   
                        we still, uh, talk... occasionally.
                                 MATT
                        Oh.
                             (beat)
                        You know if she’s seein’ anyone?

                                 JOSH
                             (taken aback)
                        Oh, uh, she hasn’t said anything... 
                        the few times I’ve spoken to her.

                                 MATT
                        ‘Cuz she’s being all, like, weird 
                        and totally not returning my texts, 
                        and I thought maybe... I dunno 
                        maybe you knew something.  She said 
                        you were pretty cool.

                                 JOSH
                        Did she?

           Matt nods.

                                 JOSH
                        Well, Matt, I, I wish I could help 
                        you, but I... 

                                 MATT
                        Yeah, that’s okay.

           He drops his skateboard down and looks at Josh a long moment.

           He hesitates - could he know about Josh and Cloe?

                                 MATT
                        Thanks, anyway.

                                 JOSH
                        No problem.

           Matt starts to skate away, then stops and turns back to Josh.

                                 MATT
                        She’s pretty rad, you know?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.  I know.

           He skates off.  Josh, pensive, watches him go.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Lisa watches TV.  
           Josh enters, looking distracted and stressed.  

           Lisa looks up from the TV, sees Josh’s mood and is concerned.  

                                 LISA
                        Hi, hon.

                                 JOSH
                        Hey.

                                 LISA
                        How was your day?

                                 JOSH
                             (checks mail)
                        Uh-huh.

           He starts to walk off.  Lisa looks worried.

                                 LISA
                             (cautiously)
                        Josh?

           He turns.

                                 LISA
                        Do you want to watch some TV?

                                 JOSH
                        Um. No, that’s okay.

                                 LISA
                        Well, it’s ‘Fashion Files’ and I 
                        know you like that show, so I --

                                 JOSH
                        Actually, Lisa, I don’t like that 
                        show, and I don’t want to watch it!

                                 LISA
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 JOSH
                        Nothing.  I just can’t take one 
                        more night of the fucking mindless, 
                        vapid moron-fest that is reality 
                        TV, okay?

                                 LISA
                        No, it’s not okay.  Josh, what’s 
                        going on with you?  You’ve been 
                        distant for weeks and now you’re 
                        acting like a total rude asshole!
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LISA (CONT'D)
                        Are you still trying to punish me 
                        for that Cloe thing?

                                 JOSH
                             (coming apart)
                        What?  No, no, that’s, no I just - 
                        I’m under a lot of pressure at work 
                        and right now I’m tired and I need 
                        a shower, and -- I know I’ve put 
                        you off about the marriage stuff, 
                        but it’s just been -- we jumped 
                        right into it and suddenly it’s 
                        like everything is coming in on me 
                        all at once and I’m just not sure --

           Lisa hears this and instantly looks worried.

                                 JOSH
                        No, no, Lisa, don’t.  I don’t mean 
                        that, I’m just --
                             (beat)
                        Give me ten minutes, okay?

           Lisa is stunned and pretty-much baffled by Josh’s outburst.

                                 LISA
                             (trying to calm him)
                        Okay.  Take your time.

           Josh fumbles out of the living room.

           A moment later Lisa hears the shower.  

           She listens to it, then, after a thought --

           BATHROOM - BATHTUB

           Josh showers.  Suddenly, the curtain’s pulled back and it’s --

           Lisa... naked.  

           Josh’s eyes pop.  

           Lisa steps in with him, she’s deliberate and determined.

           Josh says nothing, just stares at her, then --

           They kiss deeply, and with increasing passion...

           BEDROOM - LATER

           Josh and Lisa lay in bed, sweaty.  The clock reads 3:23 am.  
           Josh stares at the ceiling - astonished.  Lisa glows.

                                 LISA
                        Is it me, or has it not been like 
                        that in a long time?

                                 JOSH
                        It’s not you.

           Lisa nuzzles to him.

                                 JOSH
                        Lees, I’m sorry I’ve been so -- I 
                        know I’ve been... distant, I just --

                                 LISA
                        You don’t have to apologize.

                                 JOSH
                        No, I do, I -- since we decided to 
                        get married, I’ve just been 
                        thinking about a lot of things.  
                        Things I haven’t thought about 
                        before and I -- it’s hard to 
                        explain, I --

                                 LISA
                             (drifting off)
                        Don’t try.  We’re fine.  It’s late.  
                        We’ll talk tomorrow.  I love you.

           She falls asleep.

           Josh tries to respond, but says nothing, only stares...

           INT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - JOSH’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Josh still stares, as if he hasn’t closed his eyes all night.  

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Hey Josh, you got a second --

           He arrives, then gets a good look at Josh.  

                                 MIKE
                        Whoa, son, what happened to you? 

                                 JOSH
                        Uh, late night.

                                 MIKE
                        You sly dog.  Guess this 
                        engagement’s agreeing with you?
           No response from Josh.

                                 MIKE
                        Hello?

           He sees Josh’s desperation, and his eyes go wide with fear...

           INT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - MIKE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mike sits in his chair.  Josh slumps down across from him.

                                 MIKE
                        Josh, buddy, what’s the problem?

                                 JOSH
                        I’m in love...

                                 MIKE
                        That’s a problem?

                                 JOSH
                        ...with a sixteen-year-old girl.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s a problem.
                             (beat)
                        Wait, it’s that girl from the 
                        article!  You danced too close to 
                        the flames, man, the writer’s 
                        fallen for his subject.  Classic!

                                 JOSH
                        I’m afraid it’s more than that.

                                 MIKE
                        So you’ve got a crush - a bizarre 
                        and somewhat disturbing crush - but 
                        it’ll pass.  Just keep your hands 
                        off her, know what I mean?

           Josh looks up at Mike, guilt written all over his face.

                                 MIKE
                        Wait, you didn’t... 

           Josh’s look confirms it.  

           Mike’s eyes bug out.  He leaps out of his chair and does a 
           kind of a ‘stepping on hot coals’ dance.
                                 MIKE
                        Whoa, whoa, shit, Josh, this is 
                        bad, really bad, I’m mean, this 
                        means you’re a statut -- OH MY GOD!

                                 JOSH
                        No, no, Mike, Mike it’s okay.  It’s 
                        not illegal.  The age of consent in 
                        Ohio is sixteen.

                        Sixteen?

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, no reason, uh...
                             (changing the subject)
                        So, so does Lisa know?

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, no, no, god no.  I’m just 
                        trying to work this out, you know, 
                        it’s pretty complicated.

                                 MIKE
                        Fuckin’-Ay right, it is.  Is it 
                        this girl who kept you up all 
                        night?

                                 JOSH
                        No, that was me and Lisa.

                                 MIKE
                        But you’re also, um... with the 
                        sixteen-year-old?

                                 JOSH
                        Like I said, complicated.  
                             (beat)
                        Cloe is amazing.  She’s just this 
                        bolt of lightning.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        I’ve never met anyone like her.  
                        I’ve never felt the way I feel when 
                        I’m with her.

                                 MIKE
                             (genuine concern)
                        You really think you’re in love?

                                 JOSH
                        I know it’s crazy.  I know it.  But 
                        I think I might be.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, I know this is rather 
                        indelicate, but how’s the um, uh...

                                 JOSH
                        Off the charts.

                                 MIKE
                             (a look of fear, then)
                        So, what do you want to do?

                                 JOSH
                        What else can I do?  I’ve got to 
                        stop this.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, then you need a plan.  Here’s 
                        what you do.  Take some time.  Try 
                        to cool it with the little kid --

                                 JOSH
                        Mike!

                                 MIKE
                        You know what I mean.
                             (beat)
                        Put same space between you and the 
                        problem, just for now.  Then, get 
                        your ass to the gym.  Work out till 
                        you can’t see straight.  Emotions 
                        are just chemicals in the body.  
                        Like snake venom, you gotta sweat 
                        this shit out of your system.

                                 JOSH
                        You think that’ll work?

                                 MIKE
                        Not a clue.

           Josh sighs.
           INT. GYM - CARDIO AREA - DAY

           Josh sweats profusely as he runs the treadmill - hard.

           WEIGHT TRAINING AREA

           Josh works a chest machine while, next to him, two YUPPIES, 
           ROB and DAVE, 30’s, trade off on the bench press.

                                 YUPPIE ROB
                        Jesus friggin’ christ, you should 
                        have seen it.

                                 YUPPIE DAVE
                        Oh, here we go...

                                 YUPPIE ROB
                        My daughter just turned sixteen, 
                        right, and she wants to have a pool 
                        party, and I’m like, fine, just 
                        nobody gets too drunk and no drugs.

           Josh can’t help but overhear their conversation.

                                 YUPPIE ROB
                        So, last Sunday I have, I kid you 
                        not, about a dozen smokin’-ass
                        teenage girls in bikinis dancing 
                        around my back yard.  I mean, shit!

                                 YUPPIE DAVE
                        You’re a sick man.

                                 YUPPIE ROB
                        Oh, guilty as charged.  The things 
                        I was thinking?  Please.  And my 
                        wife kept looking at me, you know, 
                        with that ‘look.’

                                 YUPPIE DAVE
                        What did she think you were gonna 
                        do?

                                 YUPPIE ROB
                        Seriously, right?  I mean I’m a 
                        sick bastard, but I’m not a sick 
                        bastard, you know what I mean?

           Josh, now thoroughly uncomfortable, rises and walks off.
           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Lisa’s cooking a feast.  Josh enters in his gym clothes.

                                 LISA
                        Hey, baby!

           She kisses him and feels his arms.

                                 LISA
                        Looking good, tiger.

                                 JOSH
                        Uh, thanks.

                                 LISA
                        You just relax, I’m making all your 
                        favorites.  It’ll be ready soon.

           Josh smiles a little.

           KITCHEN - LATER

           Josh and Lisa finish their wine over what’s left of dinner.

                                 LISA
                        You want another piece of cake?

                                 JOSH
                        God, no.  But everything was 
                        fantastic, babe, really great.

           She beams.  Josh smiles back.

           LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Josh and Lisa cuddle on the couch, contented.  Lisa clicks 
           through channels on the TV, and stops on a magazine show.

                                 TV HOST (V.O.)
                        “Next up, “Cyber Stalkers.”  Adult 
                        predators who find their innocent 
                        teenage victims online and exploit 
                        them for sexual purposes.  Is your 
                        child at risk?”

                                 LISA
                        Ugh.  Perverts.  

           Josh’s eyes bug out.
                                 LISA
                        Has Cloe ever said she has, you 
                        know, guys in their twenties 
                        contacting her online?

                                 JOSH
                        Uh... no.  And I really haven’t 
                        talked to her in a while, anyway.

                                 LISA
                        Oh?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, you know, teenagers.  Short 
                        attention span.

                                 LISA
                        Oh.
                             (looks back at TV)
                        Pathetic.  They should all be 
                        publicly castrated.

           Josh looks nauseous.

                                 JOSH
                        Why don’t you see if there’s a 
                        movie on?

           INT. CLOE’S HOUSE - CLOE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Donna, annoyed, scans the scholarship papers on Cloe’s desk.

           Cloe appears at the door.

                                 CLOE
                        Way to invade my privacy.

                                 DONNA
                        What the hell is all this?

                                 CLOE
                        Scholarship stuff.

                                 DONNA
                        I can see that.  Don’t think for a 
                        minute I’m paying for some art 
                        school, young lady.

           Cloe grabs the papers from her mother.

                                 CLOE
                        That’s why it’s called a  
                        scholarship, mother.
                                 DONNA
                        You’re not getting a degree that’s 
                        only gonna leave you unemployed.

                                 CLOE
                        Well, thanks for believing in me!

                                 DONNA
                        You sound just like your father.  
                        Life doesn’t work out the way you 
                        want it to, Cloe.  I wanted to go 
                        to college, but I had you instead, 
                        all on my own.  I sacrificed.  You 
                        need a career you can rely on.  Get 
                        this other crap out of your head.

                                 CLOE
                        God, you are so unfair!

                                 DONNA
                        Life’s unfair, kiddo.

           She struts out, leaving Cloe frustrated and angry.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - COMPUTER AREA - NIGHT

           It’s late.  Josh opens his email and clicks through; delete - 
           delete - delete, then suddenly --

           ‘Bloop,’ an IM pops up.  It’s from Cloe.

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “’Sup?”

           Josh sees it, but doesn’t respond.

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “My mom’s being a total bitch, got 
                        a minute?”

           Josh stares at the screen.

                                 CLOE’S IM
                        “Helloooooo?”

           Josh, tense, closes the chat program and shuts his computer.

           But after a moment --

           “BLING” - his phone announces a new text.  He opens it...
                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “Hey, I think your computer is 
                        having emotional issues.”

           Josh shuts off the phone.  He looks worried.

           INT. CLOE’S HOUSE - CLOE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Cloe lays on her bed, staring at the phone screen... Nothing.  
           She frowns, and texts another message.

                                 CLOE’S TEXT
                        “RU OK?”

           She hits ‘send’ and waits...

           And waits...

           But a response doesn’t come.  Cloe’s baffled.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Cloe, on her phone, walks the curb like a balance beam.

                                 CLOE
                        Hey, it’s me.  I emailed and texted
                        you and it’s been, like, six hours 
                        and I haven’t heard anything and I 
                        really want to talk to you...

           INT. JOSH’S CAR - DAY (MOVING)

           Josh, tense, listens to the rest of Cloe’s message:

                                 CLOE (V.O.)
                        “...I’m sorry if I said something 
                        that made you mad.  You know me, I 
                        just open my stupid mouth and god 
                        knows what comes out.  Um... okay, 
                        so call me.  I miss you.  Bye.”

           Josh, guilt weighing heavily on him, turns off his phone.

           INT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - JOSH’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Josh opens his email to find a string of emails from Cloe.  
           He deletes them unread, then blocks Cloe’s email address.
           INT. SUNRISE MALL - C-TOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Cloe works the counter.  A BUSINESS MAN, 30’s, approaches.

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        Venti drip, please.

           Cloe glances at him.

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        Decaf.

           Cloe’s face drops.  Her eyes well up.

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        Regular is fine.

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           Josh and Lisa browse the flatware.  Lisa clings to Josh, who 
           tries his best to look interested.

                                 LISA
                        Oh my god, I just cannot decide.
                             (holds up a plate)
                        Do you like this, hon?

                                 JOSH
                             (really trying)
                        Um... sure.

           Lisa squeezes him tightly.

           They walk a bit further and Josh stops short when he sees --

           A TEENAGE GIRL behind a counter.  She’s got a real ‘Cloe’ 
           look to her.  She seems bored as she texts someone.

           The Girl glances at Josh.  He smiles pleasantly.  She sneers 
           back.  He quickly looks away.

           EXT. PARK - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

           Josh shoots three-pointers.  He hits one, then another, and 
           another.  But despite this success, he looks miserable.

           INT. CLOE’S HOUSE - CLOE’S ROOM - DAY

           Cloe, frazzled, sits on her bed in front of her laptop.  She 
           wears headphones.
           She checks her email, reads... frowns.  She hits refresh.

           She clicks through a music website - song, after song, after 
           song - but nothing is right.  She throws off the headphones.

           She refreshes her email again and again.  Still nothing.  

           Frustrated, she rubs her face, then suddenly calms, and --

           Opens a new tab and searches on “Today’s Guy Magazine.”  At 
           the web page, she clicks the link called, “Map our Location.”  

           Cloe hesitates only a moment, then studies the map...

           EXT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Josh emerges from the building and walks.  He looks pensive.

           A little further on, he stops short, then --

           Searches, a little unsure, for his keys, then finds them.

           He gets in his car and drives off.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Josh enters.  The apt is dark except for a light coming from 
           the kitchen.  Curious, he investigates and sees --

           KITCHEN

           Lisa, bringing a cup of tea to the kitchen table for --

           Cloe!

           Josh’s eyes go wide.  Lisa sees him.

                                 LISA
                        Josh.  We have a visitor.

           Cloe looks up at Josh and forces a nervous smile.  Josh looks 
           down at Cloe - hoping Lisa can’t see him sweat.

                                 JOSH
                        Hi, Cloe.

                                 CLOE
                        I haven’t seen you in a while.

                                 JOSH
                        It has been a while.  How are you?
                                 LISA
                             (condescending)
                        Cloe’s been telling me about all 
                        the schools you helped her apply 
                        to.  It sounds exciting.

           Suddenly, she hears the low ‘RING’ of a cell phone.

                                 LISA
                        Oh, that’s my phone.
                             (to Josh)
                        Honey, sit down.  Relax!

           She exits, leaving Josh and Cloe alone.

           Josh sits across the table from Cloe.  Lisa can be heard on 
           the phone in the next room.

                                 JOSH
                        What are you doing here?

                                 CLOE
                        You’ve been totally blowing me off, 
                        what else am I supposed to do?

                                 JOSH
                        You need to leave.  I’ll talk to 
                        you later.

                                 CLOE
                        No you won’t.

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe --

                                 CLOE
                        I love you.

           The words hit Josh hard.  Cloe sees this.

                                 CLOE
                        I love you.

           Josh is about to reply when Lisa enters.

                                 LISA
                        Sorry about that.
                             (beat)
                        Why don’t we all go into the living 
                        room and relax?

           Cloe grabs her tea and hurries out, avoiding Josh’s glare.
                                 LISA
                             (whispers to Josh)
                        She’s so cute!

           Josh looks like he’s going to pass out.  

           LIVING ROOM

           They sit around the coffee table.

                                 LISA
                        Josh, Cloe said that there was 
                        something important she wanted to 
                        say, but that she wanted to wait 
                        for you to get home, first.

                                 JOSH
                        Really?

                                 CLOE
                        Yeah.

           Beat.

                                 LISA
                        Well?  Is it college news?

                                 CLOE
                             (very nervous)
                        No, um, I, I don’t, I’m sorry, I --

           She starts to cry.  Lisa sees.  So does Josh.

                                 LISA
                        Cloe, sweetie, what is it?

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe...

                                 CLOE
                        I’m sorry.  You seem really nice, 
                        but I have tell you.  Josh and I --

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe!

                                 CLOE
                             (blurts it out)
                        We’ve been together, in, in a 
                        relationship.  We’ve been sleeping 
                        together.  I love him.  And I know 
                        he loves me.
           Silence.  

           Cloe’s winded, Josh is terrified, and --

           Lisa stares, completely stunned, then --

                                 LISA
                        Oh my god, Josh.  I knew it.

           Josh tries to speak, when --

                                 LISA
                        Cloe, I was a teenager once, and I 
                        understand what it’s like to have a 
                        crush, especially on someone like 
                        Josh, but sweetie, you can’t go 
                        around saying things like this --

                                 CLOE
                        It’s the truth.

                                 LISA
                        Sweetie, I’m sure you think it is --

                                 CLOE
                        This isn’t some teenage fantasy!

                                 LISA
                        Now, sweetie --

                                 CLOE
                        Stop calling me that!  I’m not 
                        delusional and I’m not a liar!  
                        Josh, say something!

           Josh avoids her desperate eyes.

                                 LISA
                        Josh doesn’t have to say anything, 
                        Cloe.  It’s you that need to admit 
                        that you’re making this up --

                                 CLOE
                        Bull shit!

                                 LISA
                        I’m trying to be nice to you, Cloe, 
                        but I’m not going to let you sit 
                        here and --

                                 CLOE
                        Fuck you, Mary Poppins!
                                 LISA
                        All right, that’s it, you’re 
                        leaving!

           She stands and grabs Cloe’s arm.

                                 CLOE
                        Josh, tell her!  Josh!

           Josh stands, but still won’t look at her.  

           Lisa hustles Cloe to the door.

                                 CLOE
                        Let go of me!  Josh, please!

           But Josh says nothing.  He watches, almost frozen.

           Lisa pushes Cloe.  Cloe fights back.  And Josh stares, then --

           Inexplicably, he hears himself speak...

                                 JOSH
                        It’s true.

           Lisa and Cloe turn...

                                 JOSH
                        Lisa.  Everything she said is true.

           For a moment Lisa’s confused, but Josh’s face assures her 
           that there’s no uncertainty, then --

                                 LISA
                        You fucker! You fucker, you 
                        fucker, you fucker!!  Bastard!     
                        I knew it!  I knew it!!

           She physically attacks Josh with all she has.  Cloe recoils.

                                 LISA
                        Liar!  You fucking liar!!

                                 JOSH
                        Lisa, stop!  Stop it!  Calm down!
                             (beat)
                        Cloe, wait outside!

           Cloe runs out.

                                 LISA
                        You son-of-a-bitch!  I felt guilty 
                        for doubting you, and you let me!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LISA (CONT'D)
                        And you were fucking that little 
                        girl!

                                 JOSH
                        She’s not a little girl --

                                 LISA
                        Don’t even try to defend yourself!

           She attacks Josh again.

                                 JOSH
                        Lisa, stop this!

                                 LISA
                        Get out!  Just get the fuck out of 
                        here!  Get out!!!

                                 JOSH
                        Lisa, stop.  Please!  Just, just --

                                 LISA
                        No, no, no, no, just get out of 
                        here.  Get out, get out, get out!!!

           Josh escapes out the front door.

           Lisa slams the door, rears back, takes a breath and SCREAMS.

           EXT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Josh reels, in shock.  Cloe, very scared, waits nearby.

           From inside, Josh hears Lisa cry out, then smash something.  
           He takes this as his cue, and grabs Cloe’s hand.

                                 JOSH
                        Come on.

           INT. JOSH’S CAR - NIGHT (MOVING)

           Josh drives.  Cloe stares at him.

                                 CLOE
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.

           Josh doesn't respond.

                                 CLOE
                        Are you gonna say anything?
           Josh looks at her, starts to speak, then thinks better of it.  
           He drives.  Cloe just sits, confused.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Josh pulls in and stops in a deserted area under a light.

           He jumps out of the car and slams the door.  Cloe gets out, 
           but can do nothing but watch him.

                                 JOSH
                             (paces, mumbling)
                        I cannot believe this.  I cannot 
                        believe this!

                                 CLOE
                        I’m sorry.

           Josh glances at Cloe, still says nothing and keeps pacing.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m thirty-five years old.  You’re 
                        sixteen.  Sixteen!  You come into 
                        my life now?  Now?!?
                             (right at Cloe)
                        You know, I was fine!  Everything 
                        was fine till I met you!

                                 CLOE
                        You seemed so miserable.

                                 JOSH
                        Yes, I was miserable, but I didn’t 
                        know I was miserable!

                                 CLOE
                        I’m sorry.  I love you.

           Josh stops and looks at her.  He calms.  Cloe’s still unsure.

           Suddenly, Josh walks right up to her.  She’s confused, then --

                                 JOSH
                        I love you, too.

           Cloe breaks into tears, then laughter, as she throws her arms 
           around Josh and they embrace and kiss...

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lisa huddles on the couch crying some, but mostly seething.
           Then, she gets an idea --

           COMPUTER AREA

           Lisa jumps into the chair and opens Josh’s computer.  She 
           does a hard drive search on “Cloe,” and an address book 
           listing pops up for “Cloe Vardis - Home.”

                                 LISA
                        You little shit.

           She opens the listing, reads, then picks up her phone...

           INT. JOSH’S CAR - NIGHT (MOVING)

           Josh and Cloe, amazingly, actually look a little happy.

                                 JOSH
                        Remember the time you asked me what 
                        inspired me and I didn’t have an 
                        answer?

                                 CLOE
                        Yeah?

                                 JOSH
                        I do now.

           They clasp hands.  Cloe smiles warmly.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

           Josh’s car pulls up at the curb and stops.

           INT. JOSH’S CAR - NIGHT (PARKED)

           Josh and Cloe feel the weight of the situation.

                                 CLOE
                        Where are you gonna go?

                                 JOSH
                        Not back home.

                                 CLOE
                        I’m sorry I did that.  I just --
                                 JOSH
                        Don’t be.  I’m sorry I cut you off.  
                        It was a shit thing to do.  This 
                        whole situation is just... crazy.

           Cloe suddenly looks worried.

                                 JOSH
                        But I love you Cloe.  I do. 

           They kiss.  

           Cloe exits the car.  Josh watches her go.

           INT. CLOE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Donna watches TV.  As the front door handle turns, she hears 
           it, shuts off the TV and waits.

           Cloe enters, with some trepidation.

                                 CLOE
                        Hi.

                                 DONNA
                        Hi.

           Cloe, relieved, heads for her room, when --

                                 DONNA
                        You wanna come here and talk to me?

                                 CLOE
                        What is it?

                                 DONNA
                        What is it?  I just got a call from 
                        that Josh guy’s girlfriend, that’s 
                        what ‘it is.’  What the hell are 
                        you’re doing, Cloe, he’s thirty-
                        five years old! 

                                 CLOE
                        I’m aware of that, mother --

                                 DONNA
                        Oh, no, drop the attitude.

                                 CLOE
                        I love Josh, mom, and he loves me.

                                 DONNA
                        Oh, please!  He loves fucking you!  
                                 CLOE
                        Yeah, and I happen to love fucking 
                        him!

                                 DONNA
                        Cloe!

                                 CLOE
                        Mom, you got me birth control when 
                        I was fourteen.  You let me have 
                        boys over!

                                 DONNA
                        Yeah, boys your own age.

                                 CLOE
                        So, it’s not the sex, it’s his age?

                                 DONNA
                        Yes, of course it is!

                                 CLOE
                        I can do what I want with my body, 
                        but only if it’s with someone my 
                        own age?  That’s so stupid.

                                 DONNA
                        No, it’s the way things are.  And 
                        there’s something wrong with a man 
                        his age who goes after... you.

                                 CLOE
                        What’s the matter mom, you jealous 
                        that he didn’t go after you?

           SMACK! - Donna answers Cloe with a slap across her face!

                                 DONNA
                        I’m your mother!

                                 CLOE
                        Since when?

           Donna’s stunned.

                                 DONNA
                        Do you know how much I’ve 
                        sacrificed for you?

                                 CLOE
                        How could I not, mom?  You remind 
                        me all the time - how much you gave 
                        up to have me; how there were all 
                        these things missed out on.
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLOE (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        I didn’t decide to have me, mom, 
                        you did.  It’s not my fault, but 
                        you still blame me every day of 
                        your life for it.

                                 DONNA
                        You have a great life, Cloe, I’ve 
                        always given you the freedom to do 
                        whatever you wanted. 

                                 CLOE
                        Bullshit.  You’ve let me do what I 
                        wanted because you were too busy 
                        doing what you wanted!

                                 DONNA
                        Well, I’m not going to let you do 
                        this!

                                 CLOE
                        You can’t stop me, it’s not 
                        illegal.

                                 DONNA
                        You’re still a minor.  I’ll get a 
                        restraining order.

                                 CLOE
                        You do and I swear to god you’ll 
                        never see me again.

           An angry moment passes between them.

                                 DONNA
                        You really think he’s gonna leave 
                        his girlfriend to be with you?

                                 CLOE
                        You don’t know him, and you don’t 
                        know us.

                                 DONNA
                        Ugh, spare me.

                                 CLOE
                        Never.  You’ve never believed in 
                        me.  You’ve never supported me.  

                                 DONNA
                        I feed you!  I’ve given you a roof 
                        over your head! 
                                 CLOE
                        Well, maybe you don’t have to 
                        anymore.

           Beat.  It’s a standoff.

                                 DONNA
                        Cloe, you leave here to be with 
                        him, and you’re not welcome back.

           Cloe’s wounded by Donna’s words, but without speaking and 
           almost on autopilot, she turns and walks out of the house.

           Donna’s incredulous, and shaking, but says nothing.

           EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

           Cloe runs to a stop, gasping with tears streaming.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Josh, depressed, sits with an untouched meal.  

           His phone rings.  He grabs it and sees it’s from Cloe.

                                 JOSH
                        Hey.
                             (listens)
                        Okay, okay, just -- okay, okay, 
                        I’ll be right there...

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Josh and Cloe lay together on the made-up bed - fully clothed 
           - both of them reeling, but for the moment, calm.

                                 JOSH
                        You feeling better?

                                 CLOE
                        A little.

           Beat.

                                 JOSH
                        Well, you can’t say this hasn’t 
                        been interesting.

           They both break into nervous laughter, then, it subsides.
                                 CLOE
                        What are we gonna do?

                                 JOSH
                        Believe me, I’ve been thinking 
                        about nothing else.

                                 CLOE
                             (looks right at him)
                        Do you really want to be with me?

                                 JOSH
                             (almost not believing it)
                        I really do.

                                 CLOE
                        Then, let’s just be together. 

                                 JOSH
                        You make that sound so simple.

                                 CLOE
                        Why isn’t it?  Everybody knows now.

                                 JOSH
                        Well, for starters, you’ve got to 
                        go to college.

                                 CLOE
                        I’m not going to college.

           Beat.

                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 CLOE
                        We’re together now.  Why would I 
                        want to go to college?  I just want 
                        to be with you.

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, you’re going.

           They sit up - the peaceful mood has changed...

                                 CLOE
                        What, now you’re telling me what to 
                        do with my life?

                                 JOSH
                        No, I’m telling you what you’re not 
                        gonna do with it.
                                 CLOE
                        What the fuck does that mean?

                                 JOSH
                        You have a list of about a hundred 
                        things you want.  You’re not giving 
                        them up just to be with me.

                                 CLOE
                        I don’t care about that, now.

                                 JOSH
                        Well, I do.

                                 CLOE
                        But you said you love me.

                                 JOSH
                        I do, believe me, I wouldn’t go 
                        through all this if I didn’t.

                                 CLOE
                        Wait... I want to be with you and 
                        you want to be with me, but if I 
                        stay here so we can be together, 
                        what, you’ll break up with me?

                                 JOSH
                        Absolutely.

                                 CLOE
                        Oh my god, that is insane!

                                 JOSH
                        I’m sorry.

           Cloe jumps up, searching for an answer.

                                 CLOE
                        I’ll just stay anyway.  You can’t 
                        stop me. 

                                 JOSH
                        Then stay, but we won’t be 
                        together.

                                 CLOE
                        I do not understand this at all!

                                 JOSH
                             (a sinking feeling)
                        I know.
                                 CLOE
                        So, make me.

                                 JOSH
                        I can’t.

                                 CLOE
                        Why?

                                 JOSH
                        Because you’re sixteen... fuck.

                                 CLOE
                        Oh, come on, Josh --

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, if you stay with me - if you 
                        don’t go to college now, you may 
                        not get the chance again.

                                 CLOE
                        I can go later.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, but later isn’t...
                             (struggles)
                        Leaving home, seeing how big the 
                        world really is, and how small 
                        yours has been?  I can’t explain 
                        it.  You just have to live it.  And 
                        this is your time to do that.

                                 CLOE
                        Josh...

                                 JOSH
                        If you stay, things will change in 
                        your life, or this thing with us 
                        won’t work out.  Time passes faster 
                        the older you get, and one day you 
                        turn around and all your plans and 
                        where you thought you’d be are 
                        just... gone.

                                 CLOE
                             (tears in her eyes)
                        You don't know that.

                                 JOSH
                        Cloe, I’m living proof of that.

           Cloe sits back on the bed with him.
                                 CLOE
                        But I don’t want to leave you.

                                 JOSH
                        And I don’t want you to go.  But 
                        you have to.

           Cloe’s stunned.  She wants to speak, but no words come.  And 
           somehow, some small part of her knows Josh is right.  

           Josh, certain he’s right, looks absolutely miserable.

           EXT. CLEVELAND - DAY

           A late-summer wind pushes around the first falling leaves.

           INT. CLOE’S HOUSE - CLOE’S ROOM - DAY

           Cloe stoically works at her computer.  She sends email after 
           email - each a different scholarship application.

           INT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - MIKE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mike sits across his desk from a downtrodden Josh.  A 
           nauseating silence hangs in the room.

                                 MIKE
                        Jesus.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        So... Lisa?

                                 JOSH
                        I moved out.  She won’t even look 
                        at me.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry.

                                 JOSH
                        No, it’s for the best.  It should 
                        have happened a long time ago.

                                 MIKE
                        And Cloe?
                                 JOSH
                        Rhode Island School of Design. 
                        She’s working out the scholarships, 
                        but it’s looking good.

                                 MIKE
                             (trying to be positive)
                        Well, that’s good.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.  And I’m happy about it.  I 
                        am.  She’s got her whole life in 
                        front of her.  If she’d stayed here 
                        for me it might have worked for a 
                        while, but there’s just no way it 
                        wouldn’t have ended badly.

           Mike nods.  A thoughtful moment passes, then, he frowns.

                                 MIKE
                        Well...

           Beat.

                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        Life ends badly, when you think 
                        about it.  I mean, we’re all gonna 
                        end up the same place one way or 
                        another, right?  All we really have 
                        are the moments in between.

           Josh listens closely.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ve found that the future pretty 
                        much has a way of working itself 
                        out, you know?  You just try to 
                        find a little joy in it all.  If 
                        you’re really lucky... love.  

           Boom.  

           Josh’s face drops.  Then, slowly but deliberately, a light 
           bulb glows above his head.  His eyes bug out.  He starts to 
           hyperventilate.  Mike sees.

                                 MIKE
                        Josh?

           Suddenly, Josh jumps up stares intensely at Mike, who then 
           stands to face him.
                                 MIKE
                        What’s wrong?

           Then, Josh hauls off and PUNCHES Mike squarely in the face.

           Mike heads straight for the floor.

           Josh then snaps out of his trance and leaps to Mike’s aid.

                                 JOSH
                        Mike!

                                 MIKE
                        Please, I have a weak heart...

           Josh sits him up.  Suddenly, he’s giddily happy.

                                 JOSH
                        Mike, I’m sorry.  And I quit.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s okay, buddy, I pretty much 
                        had you fired half-way down to the 
                        floor.

                                 JOSH
                        Listen, I gotta go.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, u-huh, sure.

           Josh hurries out.

                                 MIKE
                        I mean, who am I to... ugh.

           He falls back down to the floor.

           INT. “TODAY’S GUY” MAGAZINE OFFICES - JOSH’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Josh opens his cell phone and dials Cloe’s number...

                                 CLOE’S MESSAGE
                        “Hey, it’s Cloe.  I’m not here --”

           Josh closes his phone, then jumps behind his computer.

           He checks his email, instant messages, social networking 
           sites - everywhere Cloe might be....

           Nothing.

           Frustrated, he YANKS the mouse cord out of the computer.
           Mouse still in hand, Josh charges through the cubicles.  

           He passes Vince, stops, and shoves the mouse into his hand.

                                 JOSH
                        This is for you.

           Vince takes the mouse, then watches, baffled, as Josh leaves.

           INT. SUNRISE MALL - C-TOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Josh enters and encounters a long line of PATRONS.  He scans 
           the store... no Cloe.

           Josh pushes his way to the front of the line where a YUPPIE 
           is in mid-order with a BARISTA.

                                 YUPPIE
                        Tall latte.  No, make it a grande.  
                        Grande skinny latte --

           Josh shoves the Customer aside.

                                 YUPPIE
                        Hey!

                                 JOSH
                        Haven’t you had enough coffee?!?

           The Yuppie jumps back.  Josh turns to the Barista.

                                 JOSH
                        Is Cloe here?

                                 BARISTA
                        She left a little while ago.

                                 JOSH
                        Thanks.

           He turns and rushes out.

                                 YUPPIE
                             (to the Barista)
                        What kind tea do you have?

           INT. JOSH’S CAR - DAY (MOVING)

           Josh scans the streets as he drives... no Cloe.
           EXT. CLOE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Josh’s car pulls up near a park across the street.

           INT. JOSH’S CAR - DAY (PARKED)

           For a few moments, Josh just stares at the front door to 
           Cloe’s house.  Then, as musters his courage and reaches for 
           the door handle --

           He glances into the park and catches sight of something...

           UPWARD, THROUGH THE LENS OF CLOE’S CAMERA

           Shimmering late-summer leaves drift in and out of focus.  

           Suddenly, into the frame comes a very blurry Josh.  As he 
           blocks the dusky sunlight, his image slowly sharpens.  He 
           smiles nervously.  

                                 JOSH
                        Hi.

           He promptly goes back out of focus.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Cloe lays in the grass, camera still in front of her face.  
           She moves it away and looks up at Josh, expressionless.

                                 JOSH
                        Hi.

                                 CLOE
                        Hi.

           Silence.

                                 JOSH
                        I, I wanted -- I need to talk to 
                        you.  I tried calling, but I, I 
                        couldn’t get you.

                                 CLOE
                        Yeah, I’ve been kind-of unplugged 
                        lately.

                                 JOSH
                             (trying to lighten things)
                        Time to roll around in the grass?
           No dice.  Cloe only smirks.

                                 CLOE
                             (stands)
                        Look, I don’t really think there’s 
                        anything to talk about.  I mean, 
                        you made yourself really clear, and 
                        I get it.  I do.  In fact --

                                 JOSH
                        No, no listen.  I know what I said, 
                        but I didn’t -- I mean, I know this 
                        situation is crazy, but --

                                 CLOE
                        Yeah, you’ve said that, like, a 
                        hundred times.  I don’t really need 
                        to hear it again.  I’m sixteen, 
                        you’re thirty-five.  There’s no 
                        denying it.  So, please just leave 
                        me alone.

           She starts to walk away.

                                 JOSH
                        No, wait, Cloe!

           She stops.

                                 JOSH
                        Just listen to me, okay?

           Cloe turns back around and waits.

           Josh struggles for the right words... and keeps struggling...

                                 CLOE
                        I’m listening.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, I’m just... gimme a second --

                                 CLOE
                             (stomps her foot)
                        Agh!!

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, okay.
                             (a deep breath)
                        Cloe, I’ve never met anyone like 
                        you.  Everything about you is just 
                        so... incredible.

           Cloe softens.
                                 JOSH
                        And I know it’s crazy, but --

           Cloe glares at him.

                                 JOSH
                             (damage control)
                        Surprising!  And very unexpected.
                             (beat)
                        When I’m with you, I feel like... 
                        me.  Like, the me that I’m supposed 
                        to be, the me that I want to be, if 
                        that makes any sense at all.

                                 CLOE
                        It does.

                                 JOSH
                        I know I said that I don’t want you 
                        missing out on your dreams just to 
                        be with me.  And I meant that.  As 
                        much as I want you in my life and I 
                        want you to be happy even more.

                                 CLOE
                        I know.

                                 JOSH
                        But what I didn’t realize until 
                        about an hour ago is that it 
                        doesn’t have to be one way or the 
                        other.

                                 CLOE
                        What do you mean?

                                 JOSH
                        I’m not gonna let you go, so you 
                        can chase your dreams.  I’m going 
                        to hold on to you, and make sure 
                        those dreams come true.

                                 CLOE
                        Josh...

                                 JOSH
                        No, listen.  I don’t have a lot of 
                        answers in this situation.  I don't 
                        know what tomorrow is going to mean 
                        for you and me.  But whereever you 
                        go next, I want to go with you.

           Cloe’s eyes fill with tears.
                                 JOSH
                        And if it doesn’t work out between 
                        us, then it doesn’t work out.  But 
                        I’m not gonna let that stop me from 
                        grabbing at the first thing in my 
                        life - the only thing - that I’ve 
                        ever been sure of.  I love you 
                        Cloe.  I love you.  And I want you 
                        in my life for however long it 
                        lasts.

           Cloe - tears streaming down her cheeks - throws her arms 
           around Josh.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m sorry.

                                 CLOE
                        Me too.

                                 JOSH
                        So you understand?

                                 CLOE
                        Yes.

                                 JOSH
                        And you love me?

                                 CLOE
                        Yes, of course.

                                 JOSH
                        And you want us to be together?

           Cloe clings to Josh, but doesn’t say... anything.

           Josh breaks their embrace and looks at her.

                                 JOSH
                        You want us to be together, don’t 
                        you?

           Still no answer from Cloe.

                                 JOSH
                        Right there, you’re supposed to say 
                        ‘yes.’

                                 CLOE
                             (sad)
                        Yeah.
                                 JOSH
                        Not exactly what I was thinking...

                                 CLOE
                        Josh...
                             (sits on the ground)
                        Come here.

                                 JOSH
                             (much trepidation)
                        Okay...

           He sits.  They face each other.  Cloe takes his hands.

                                 CLOE
                        Josh, I’ve never met anyone like 
                        you, either - even if that does 
                        sound a little ridiculous coming 
                        from ‘one so young.’
                             (struggling)
                        But I’ve been thinking a lot about 
                        us.  And even more about me.  For a 
                        minute there, I really did kind-of 
                        forget about everything that I said 
                        I wanted.  And that really 
                        surprised me.  And it also scared 
                        me.  I guess I’m not quite as 
                        mature as I’d like to think I am.  
                        And as much as I don’t want to be, 
                        I’m kind of just a kid.   

           Josh listens.

                                 CLOE
                        But I absolutely love you.  I do.  
                        And I hear what you’re saying about 
                        making sure my dreams come true.  I 
                        just don’t think that’s something 
                        you can do for me.  I think it’s 
                        something I have to do for myself.
                             (beat)
                        I think we just have to be a 
                        little --

                                 JOSH
                        Don’t say it.

                                 CLOE
                        Practical.

                                 JOSH
                        No, no.  Practical is bad.  Forget 
                        practical.
                                 CLOE
                        I can’t.

           Cloe looks down, sad, but nevertheless certain of herself.

           Josh is stunned, but gets it, too.

           A quiet moment passes between them.

                                 CLOE
                        What do you think?

                                 JOSH
                        I think you really know how to ruin 
                        a guy’s epiphany.

           Cloe cracks a sad smile.

                                 JOSH
                        And I think you’re a hell of a lot 
                        more mature than you give yourself 
                        credit for.

                                 CLOE
                        But am I wrong?

                                 JOSH
                        No.

                                 CLOE
                        I didn’t think so.

           They stand and face each other.  

           Josh looks at Cloe, and Cloe looks back at Josh.  Both of 
           them are worn out.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m, uh, I’m gonna go, okay?

                                 CLOE
                             (crying)
                        Yeah.

                                 JOSH
                        ‘Cuz if I stay any longer I’m just 
                        gonna really start crying, and 
                        believe me, it wouldn’t be pretty.

                                 CLOE
                        We can’t have that.

                                 JOSH
                        Right.
                                 CLOE
                        So, we’re doing the right thing, 
                        right?  

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.  Yes.  Absolutely.

                                 CLOE
                        Sometimes you’ve got to be 
                        practical?  We’re agreed?

                                 JOSH
                        Sometimes it’s a good thing.

                                 CLOE
                        That smartest thing.

                                 JOSH
                        The wisest choice.

           Beat.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, I’m just gonna give you a hug 
                        now, and then I’m gonna go, okay?

                                 CLOE
                        Okay.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay.

           They hold each other - a long, slow, warm embrace.

           A light breeze picks up.  A few leaves fall around them.

           They separate slightly, still looking into each other’s eyes, 
           doing their best to be courageous.

           Their bodies part, but they still hold hands.

           Then, they drop one hand and hold with the other as they 
           start to turn away from each other.

           Now, just their fingers intertwine as the sunlight glistens 
           through the spaces between them.

           Just fingertips touching, now, they’re about to part, when --

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, no.

                                 CLOE
                        Yeah.
           And suddenly...

           Their fingers clasp again, and --

           Josh and Cloe pull themselves back into an embrace, and --

           They kiss.  One hell of a kiss.  A kiss that does not stop.

           And they stand, holding each other in the setting sun...

                                 CLOE’S NARRATION (V.O.)
                        “I want to get drunk.  I want to be 
                        sober.  I want to do nothing.  I 
                        want to impress, seduce, joke, 
                        party, pray, nap and embrace myself 
                        through every circumstance that 
                        life sends me.  And maybe - just 
                        maybe - I won’t do it alone.”

                                                              FADE OUT.
