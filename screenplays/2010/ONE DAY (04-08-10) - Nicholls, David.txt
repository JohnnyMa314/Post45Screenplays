                         Based on the novel by David Nicholls

                          This draft (3.0); 8th April 2010
           INT. SENATE HOUSE, EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY - DAY

           CLOSE-UP: a face against a bright blue sky -

           A young woman, 22 years-old. Bright expressive eyes behind NHS
           spectacles, hair badly-cut, a little awkward, she is pretty, but 
           seems almost annoyed by the fact.

           This is EMMA MORLEY. A flash of light causes her to blink. 
           CREDITS BEGIN.

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Perhaps without the spectacles?

           REVEAL: the blue sky is a photographer’s backdrop. EMMA adjusts 
           her graduate’s gown, clutches a scroll, assumes a rather self-
           conscious facial expression she calls ‘pride’. Another flash. 
           Enough - 

                                 EMMA
                        Can I go now?

           The next fresh young graduate steps before the backdrop. 
           Attractive, self-confident, possibly a little drunk, this is 
           DEXTER MAYHEW, 23 years-old, handsome, confident, he needs no 
           prompting to pose for the camera. 

           Standing on the sidelines with her proud PARENTS, EMMA glances 
           over, amused. DEXTER catches her eye -

           CREDITS CONTINUE - 

           INT. GRADUATION PARTY, EDINBURGH - DAY

           CREDITS CONTINUE. A last-gasp student party. EMMA MORLEY laughs 
           with her best friend TILLY - flamboyant drama type - pretending 
           not to be aware that she’s being watched by - 

           DEXTER, a little drunk, in conversation with his flatmate CALLUM 
           (scruffy, even drunker).

                                 DEXTER
                        ‘Anna’?

                                 CALLUM
                        Emma. Her name’s Emma Morley, Emma or Em.

                                 DEXTER
                        I thought she was called Anna?

                                 CALLUM
                        You’ve been here four years. 

           Over to EMMA, TILLY hissing through gritted teeth.
                            One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 TILLY
                        He’s coming over! He’s coming, oh God, calm, 
                        calm, calm...
                                (TILLY turns - flirtatious)
                        Hello, you!

                                 DEXTER
                                (to EMMA)
                        We’ve never really met. 

           EXT. GARDEN, GRADUATION PARTY, EDINBURGH - NIGHT

           CREDITS CONTINUE. The party has spilled out into the garden now. 

                                 EMMA
                        I write a bit. But everyone says that, don’t 
                        they? Go up to any girl here and say how’s the 
                        writing? and not one of them would say ‘what 
                        writing?’

           DEXTER can’t look away.

                                 DEXTER
                        What d’you write?

                                 EMMA
                        The usual rubbish. Plays, poetry. That’s where 
                        the big money is, apparently. Poems. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I’d love to read them. 

                                 EMMA
                        No, you wouldn’t. 

                                 DEXTER
                        You’re absolutely right, I wouldn’t. 

           She laughs. Meanwhile TILLY and some drama-types have produced an 
           acoustic guitar and a tambourine and are beginning an assault on 
           the Simon and Garfunkel songbook.

                                 EMMA
                        A tambourine. Time to leave. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Really?

                                 EMMA
                        If I’m not home by midnight I turn into - I 
                        don’t know - an idiot!
                                (offering her hand)
                        Nice to meet you, finally - 

                                 DEXTER
                        I’ll walk you home.
                            One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           EMMA regards him - a decision.

                                 EMMA
                        Come on then.

           EXT. EDINBURGH OLD TOWN - NIGHT

           CREDITS CONTINUE. They walk together through the winding streets 
           of the Old Town, bottles in their hands - a perfect midsummer 
           night, the bells of St Giles chiming midnight.

                                 EMMA
                        ..well that’s what I believe anyway. It’s 
                        important to make a difference. You know, 
                        actually change something. 

                                 DEXTER
                        What, change the world?

                                 EMMA
                        Well, maybe not the whole world.
                                (he takes her arm. She hesitates, 
                                 carries on)
                        I expect you’ve got your future all mapped out. 
                        Probably got a little list somewhere -

                                 DEXTER
                        Hardly.

                                 EMMA
                        So go on then. What’s the masterplan?

                                 DEXTER
                        Head back to London tomorrow, then travelling. 
                        China, India...

                                 EMMA
                        ‘Travelling’. Why not just say I’m off on 
                        holiday for three years?

                                 DEXTER
                        Because travel broadens the mind.

                                 EMMA
                        I suspect you’re probably a bit too broad-minded 
                        as it is.

           And he takes this as his cue to kiss her. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Well this is a bad idea. 

           And they kiss again. TITLE - ONE DAY. 
                            One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           INT. HALLWAY, EMMA’S FLAT, EDINBURGH - NIGHT

           They continue kissing as they stumble into EMMA’s flat. 

                                 EMMA
                        So - this is me!

           Kissing, laughing, they tumble towards the bedroom.

           INT. EMMA’S BEDROOM, EDINBURGH - NIGHT

           The usual paraphernalia; albums, posters, photos. A bottle of 
           wine, an ashtray, clothes discarded on the floor. 

           EMMA, a little self-conscious, still in her underwear, talks as 
           DEXTER nuzzles at her neck.

                                 EMMA
                        Anyway, I didn’t mean what are you doing 
                        tomorrow or this time next year, I meant the 
                        future-future. What are you going to be when 
                        you’re, I don’t know...forty?

                                 DEXTER
                        Forty? Good god, forty. Can I say famous? Rich?

                                 EMMA
                        Terrible. Just a terrible human-being -

                                 DEXTER
                        The thing is, Em - 

                                 EMMA
                        ‘Em’? Who’s ‘Em’?

                                 DEXTER
                        I thought people called you Em.

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah, friends call me Em  -

                                 DEXTER
                        So I can’t call you Em?

                                 EMMA
                        Aw, go on then, Dex.

                                 DEXTER
                        The thing is, Em, I’ve decided I’m going to stay 
                        exactly as I am right now.

           EM takes him in, eyes closed, cigarette dangling. 
                            One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        You look like you’re waiting for someone to take 
                        your photo.

                                 DEXTER
                        You want me to go?

                                 EMMA
                        Not sure.

                                 DEXTER
                        So if I’m so awful -

                                 EMMA
                        - which you clearly are -

                                 DEXTER
                        - then why are we having sex?

                                 EMMA
                        Actually, I don’t think we have yet - 

                                 DEXTER
                        Well, that depends - 

                                 EMMA
                        - unless I dozed off -

                                 DEXTER
                        - on your definition -

           Suddenly EM breaks away, sits, wraps a sheet around her.

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 EMMA
                        To brush my teeth. Booze and fags.

                                 DEXTER
                        I don’t mind.

                                 EMMA
                        I do. No playing with yourself while I’m gone -

           DEXTER slumps back in the bed. He looks at the clock - 04.45 15 
           JULY. A ‘Thatcher Out’ poster glares down at him. A sigh - What 
           am I doing here?

           INT. BATHROOM, EMMA’S FLAT, EDINBURGH - DAWN

           In the mirror a gleeful EMMA brushes her teeth, assesses her 
           complexion.
                            One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           A shelf of late-‘Eighties wholesome toiletries; oatmeal scrubs 
           and raspberry face-wash. She grabs a deodorant, applies it 
           liberally, stops, sniffs, peers at the label -

                                 EMMA
                        Peach. Peach?

           Cursing, she starts to swab at her armpits with a flannel, 
           checking her reflection once more. A pep talk -

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Concentrate. Do not cock this up.

           EXT. HALLWAY, EMMA’S FLAT, EDINBURGH - DAWN

           In the cluttered hallway, the graduation cloak and mortarboard 
           have been discarded, and EMMA pulls these on, giggling, leaning 
           mock-seductively into  - 

           INT. EMMA’S BEDROOM, EDINBURGH 1988 - CONTINUOUS

           DEXTER is getting dressed.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh. You are going.

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s getting light out, so - 

                                 EMMA
                                (too quick-)
                        I don’t want you to go.
                                (then reversing-)
                        I mean I want you to go if you want to go, ships 
                        that pass in the night and all that, very 
                        poignant -

                          DEXTER
                                                        EMMA
           I just thought you might 
           need some sleep - 
                                             - very, I don’t know, 
                                             ‘bittersweet’ -

                          DEXTER
           - but if you don’t want me 
           to go -
                                                        EMMA
                                             No, go, I’m not bothered. 
                                             You sneak off - 

                          DEXTER
           I wasn’t sneaking off, I 
           just thought -
                                                        EMMA
                                             - jump out the window for 
                                             all I care. Five floors up, 
                                             mind - 

                          DEXTER
                                                        EMMA
           Fine, I’ll stay - 
                                             I’d like that.
                            One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        You do want me to stay?

                                 EMMA
                        Just to, you know - cuddle.

           Backs to each other, self-conscious, they start to get undressed, 
           EMMA pulling on a T-shirt that demands Nuclear Disarmament Now. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Can’t believe I just said ‘cuddle’.

                                 DEXTER
                        Least it wasn’t ‘snuggle’. Or ‘smooch’.

                                 EMMA
                        Let’s promise never, ever to smooch.

           An awkward little smile before they settle back into bed. EMMA 
           picks up the clock - 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Nearly morning. No more lectures, no more exams. 
                        Just real life.

                                 DEXTER
                        St. Swithin’s Day. 

                                 EMMA
                        What’s that then?

                                 DEXTER
                        15th July. It’s a tradition. If it rains today 
                        it’ll rain all summer. There’s a poem. ‘If on 
                        St. Swithin’s Day it doth rain, something 
                        something something again’

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter, that’s beautiful.

                                 DEXTER
                        Go to sleep.
                                (he closes his eyes)
                        Can you smell...peach?

                                 EMMA
                                (change the subject)
                        Dex?

                                 DEXTER
                        Em?

                                 EMMA
                        If it doesn’t rain?

                                 DEXTER
                        Hm?
                            One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        D’you want to do something? Me and you?

           On DEX - a decision.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           CLOSE UP. Bright sunlight on DEXTER’s face. He opens his eyes. A 
           WOMAN lies with her back to him.

                                 DEXTER
                        Bonjour.

           The WOMAN turns, smiles, kisses him -

           Not EMMA. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        My dear, dear friend...

           CAPTION; 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Soon I will have completed the novel that I 
                        spoke of so passionately when last we met...

           INT. PUB THEATRE, FULHAM - DAY

           C.U. An old-fashioned fountain pen, spluttering ink. EMMA speaks 
           aloud in a strangulated ‘posh’ voice.

                                 EMMA
                        It is indeed a strange creature...

           REVEAL: EMMA is writing, dressed as Virginia Woolf and sporting a 
           not entirely convincing prosthetic nose.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I have called it To The Lighthouse in fond 
                        recollection of those summers we spent 
                        together...ever yours, Virginia...Woolf.

           Piano arpeggios. Bizarrely EMMA starts to sing, a little 
           tentatively. Perhaps also a little flat.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        ‘To the Lighthouse, I long to get/To the 
                        Lighthouse, away from the Blooms-bur-y set...’

           REVEAL: we are in a fringe theatre, a shabby room above a pub. 
           EMMA suddenly breaks off from the awful song - 
                            One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, sorry can we stop a second?
                                (to TILLY, EMMA’s flatmate, the 
                                 director, sat in the empty 
                                 auditorium)
                        Can we do something about this?
                                (- the false nose -)
                        No wonder she killed herself. I’m going to have 
                        someone’s eye out with this -
                                (storming off-stage)
                        It’s a disaster, Tilly. I’m a disaster. I can’t 
                        do this.

                                 TILLY
                        Let’s have a break, shall we? Take five 
                        everyone...

           INT. PUB THEATRE, FULHAM - DAY

           EMMA pumping coins into a payphone -

                                 DEXTER (O.S.)
                        I’m sure it’s not a disaster.

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter, I’m going to get lynched. That’s if 
                        anyone comes.
                                (in a whisper)
                        - and Tilly’s sending me mad. The flat’s a dump, 
                        my room’s got no windows, I keep finding teeth-
                        marks in the cheese and her big grey bras 
                        soaking in the sink -

           INT. BEDROOM, PARIS - DAY

           As DEXTER listens and dresses, the WOMAN showers.

                                                       WOMAN
                                               (shouting from the 
                                               shower)
                                             Dexter! Come and join me!
                        EMMA (O.S.)
           - and London’s so big and 
           depressing, I might give 
           up, go home. Are you still 
           there? Is someone with you?

                                 DEXTER 
                        No-one, just the cleaning-lady. Listen, Em, you 
                        can’t give up. Nothing truly good was ever easy.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Who said that?

                                 DEXTER
                        You did.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Did I? That’s annoying.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           INT. PUB THEATRE, FULHAM - DAY

                                 EMMA
                        My money’s running out. Sorry for moaning I just 
                        really wanted to - 
                                (’hear your voice’)
                        How’s teaching?

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s fine. Very fulfilling. 

                                 EMMA
                        Well don’t sleep with any of your students. 
                        It’s unethical, and predictable. La vie 
                        Parisienne, tu aimes? Parle-tu Francaise
                        comme sa langue maternalle?

                                 DEXTER
                        I have no idea what you’ve just said.

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter, you’re meant to be teaching 
                        languages. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Listen, Em, I’ve got to go -

                                 EMMA
                        Apologise again for me, will you? I didn’t mean 
                        to call your dad a fascist - 

                                 DEXTER
                        A bourgeois fascist - 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, God. Say sorry. And Dexter?
                        Tu me manques. Tout le temps.
                                (the money runs out)
                        Look it up.

           The buzz of a dead connection. She rests her head against the 
           wall, sighs. TILLY approaches, gingerly -

                                 TILLY
                        Sorry, are you in character?

           EXT. CAFE, SAINT SULPICE, PARIS - DAY

           Now late for his appointment, DEXTER runs through the tourist 
           crowds.

           In the chic little cafe that faces the church of St. Sulpice, an 
           elegantly dishevelled woman waits, eyes closed, a book in her 
           hand, face turned towards the sun.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           This is ALISON MAYHEW. Early ‘50s, attractive, humorous, carrying 
           with her an air of having been something-in-the-Sixties. DEXTER 
           watches her fondly as she flirts with the handsome WAITER, her 
           hand on his arm.

           DEXTER approaches, startling his mother with a kiss.

                                 ALISON
                        Forty-five minutes late.

                                 DEXTER
                        Sorry. Tutorial.  

                                 ALISON
                        You look tousled. Who’s been tousling you? And 
                        where were you last night? You were meant to be 
                        meeting us for dinner.

                                 DEXTER
                        Language School disco. Two-hundred drunken 
                        Swedish girls Vogue-ing.

                                 ALISON
                        Vogue-ing. I’m pleased to say I have no idea 
                        what that is. Did you have fun?

                                 DEXTER
                        It was hell.

                                 ALISON
                        Your father’s gone back to the hotel for a lie-
                        down. His sandals were chafing his corns through 
                        his socks. So continental. 
                                (DEXTER laughs, ALISON regards him 
                                 fondly)
                        So. Tell me about your love-life.

                                 DEXTER
                        No!

                                 ALISON
                        Come on, you know I have to live vicariously 
                        through my children now. Who’s been writing you 
                        all these long letters? 

                                 DEXTER
                        None of your business.

                                 ALISON
                        Don’t make me steam them open again. Is it that 
                        girl who came to stay?

                                 DEXTER
                        Which one?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 ALISON
                        Nice girl, very earnest. Called your father a 
                        bourgeois fascist.

                                 DEXTER
                        - sucking the blood of the working classes. 
                        Emma. Yes, she’s sorry about that.

                                 ALISON
                        Oh I don’t mind. Least she had a bit of spark, 
                        not like the usual silly little things I hear 
                        tip-toeing to your room in the middle of the 
                        night.

                                 DEXTER
                        Emma and I are just good friends.

                                 ALISON
                        You’re sure about that?

                                 DEXTER
                        She’s not my type -

                                 ALISON
                          - which is exactly why I liked her.
                                (she takes his hand)
                        Walk with me.

           EXT. RUE JACOB, PARIS - DAY

           ALISON hangs affectionately on her son’s arm as they walk through 
           the elegant back streets of the 6th arrondissement.

                                 ALISON
                        ...but how much holiday do you need? It’s not 
                        like you did any work at Uni.

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m not on holiday, I have a job.

                                 ALISON
                        Teaching Beatles songs to dreamy-eyed girls, 
                        it’s hardly a vocation.

                                 DEXTER
                        I’ll settle on something soon.

                                 ALISON
                        But what?

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m weighing up my options. Journalism? 
                        Documentaries? Photography maybe.

                                 ALISON
                        I remember that school project of yours. 
                        ‘Texture’! All those close-ups of gravel!
                                (she starts to laugh)
                        And shoes! Rows of old shoes...

                                 DEXTER
                        When you’re finished?

                                 ALISON
                        Sorry! Sorry, I apologise. Don’t pout. If 
                        photography’s what you want to do, then do 
                        it. But do it with some love, some passion. 
                        You can be anything you want, Dexter. You’re 
                        young and healthy and educated and you look 
                        okay, I suppose, in a low light. But you 
                        mustn’t let time slip away from you. One day 
                        things might not be this...serene, and it 
                        would be good if you were prepared. Equipped. 

                                 DEXTER
                        You sound like dad.

                                 ALISON
                        Do I? I don’t mean to. I just want you to have 
                        some purpose, some ideals, like your friend 
                        Emma.
                                (she takes his arm)
                        I want you to make me proud, that’s all. Of 
                        course I’m already proud of you, but...

           They approach the hotel. DEXTER’s father STEVEN waits, 
           lanky, a little stern, uncomfortable in tourist’s shorts, 
           examining his feet.

                                 ALISON (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t that Alain Delon? Ah, no, it’s 
                        your father, picking his corns. Socks 
                        and sandals; c’est chic. Take me for 
                        lunch tomorrow, will you? Just me and 
                        you. Somewhere quiet with white 
                        tablecloths. I want to talk to you.

                                 DEXTER
                                (suddenly concerned)
                        Why? Is something wrong?

                                 ALISON
                        No, nothing’s wrong.

                                 DEXTER
                        So why do we need to-?

                                 ALISON
                        Do I need a reason? I simply want to talk to 
                        my handsome son. Tomorrow. We’ll talk 
                        properly tomorrow.

           INT. LOCO CALIENTE, KENTISH TOWN - DAY

           But we are not in Mexico, we are in Kentish Town, in a run-down 
           Tex-Mex restaurant where EMMA, in garish baseball cap and T-
           shirt, waits to take an order. Reciting a script -

                                 EMMA
                        Ola amigos and welcome to Loco Caliente where 
                        the food and the atmosphere are hot hot hot.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Can you tell me - what’s the difference between 
                        a tortilla and a taco?

                                 EMMA
                                (fast, by rote)
                        A tortilla’s either corn or wheat, but a corn 
                        tortilla folded and filled is a taco whereas a 
                        filled wheat tortilla is a burrito. Deep-fry a 
                        burrito, it’s a chimichanga. Toast a tortilla, 
                        it’s a tostada, roll it, it’s an enchillada
                        unless you fold it and fill with cheese in which 
                        case it becomes a quesadilla.

           A lovely summer’s evening. Post-shift, EMMA and DEXTER walk away

                        You were trying to fit your entire head in your

                        disgusting. What does she see in you anyway, 
                        this Ingrid.

                                 DEXTER
                        She says I’m complicated.

                        I don’t think you should ever, ever go back 
                        there. Just walk away.

                        just because it’s funny.

                        Everyone’s lost at twenty-five.

                                 EMMA
                        You’re not! Trainee TV producer, nice new flat, 
                        CD player. Group sex Tuesdays and Fridays -

                                 DEXTER
                        I still think you should write something. 

                                 EMMA
                        Tried that. Failed. I think I’m going to be one 
                        of those women who are always trying things.

                                 DEXTER
                        D’you know what I’d give you, if I could give 
                        you just one gift for the rest of your life? 
                        Confidence. Either that or a scented candle. 

                                 EMMA
                                (she laughs)
                        You’re nice. And I’m drunk. I should go home.  

           She stands, but impulsively he takes her hand.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        I’ve got an idea. I think you need a holiday.

                                 EMMA
                        What? Me and you?

           INT. RHODES AIRPORT, GREECE - DAWN

           Exhausted from a dawn flight, EM and DEX stand on the 
           travelator. 

           CAPTION; 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER. (NOTE - no more spectacles 
           for EM. Contact lenses from now on.)

                                 EMMA
                        Fine, but we’re going to need some guidelines 
                        if this is going to work. Rules of 
                        engagement.

                                 DEXTER
                        Such as -

                                 EMMA
                        - separate bedrooms. Wherever we stay, no shared 
                        beds, no drunken cuddles.

                                 DEXTER
                        I don’t see the point of cuddling anyway. 
                        Cuddling gives you cramp.

                                 EMMA
                        Agreed then, that’s Rule One.

           JUMP CUT: At the baggage carousel. A rucksack for DEXTER, an 
           unwieldy suitcase for EMMA.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Rule Two. No flirting. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Well I never flirt, so -

                                 EMMA
                        I’m serious. No having a few drinks and getting 
                        frisky. Scary Ingrid, remember? And that’s Rule 
                        Three. No running off with anyone else. I don’t 
                        want to look up and find you rubbing oil into 
                        Lotte from Stuttgart.

           EXT. FERRY TERMINAL, RHODES - DAY

           Tired and dusty from their journey, EMMA and DEXTER board 
           their ferry.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        Okay. Rule Four. No nudity. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Really?

                                 EMMA
                        Total or partial. I don’t want to see you shower 
                        or have a wee or have a wee in the shower, and 
                        absolutely no skinny-dipping. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I can’t promise that..

                                 EMMA
                        You’ve got to, Dex, it’s the rules. 

           EXT. FERRY, AEGEAN SEA - DAY

           An idyllic island rises out of the bluest sea. EMMA stands at 
           the rail, relishing the breeze and sun on her face. 

           The click of a shutter. EM turns, and DEXTER snaps again. 

                                 DEXTER
                        What d’you think?

                                 EMMA
                                (hiding a great grin)
                        S’alright. 

           EXT. VILLAGE/HARBOUR - DAY

           The village is small and picturesque, spreading up the hillside 
           over the quiet harbour.

                                 EMMA
                        So what happens now?

                                 DEXTER
                        You stay here with the bags, I’ll go find 
                        somewhere. 

                                 EMMA
                        A balcony, please, and a writing desk. A sea-
                        view -

                                 DEXTER
                        Yes, ma’am -

                                 EMMA
                        And Dex? 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           He turns. In her summer dress, with the first glow of a tan on 
           her face, she looks quite lovely. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Rule Number One. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Remind me?

                                 EMMA
                        Separate bedrooms? 

                                 DEXTER
                        Absolutely. Separate bedrooms. 

           INT/EXT. GUEST HOUSE BEDROOM, GREEK ISLAND - DAY

           DEXTER and the LANDLADY stand in a bright, light, pleasant room. 
           There’s a writing desk, a balcony that opens up onto a view of 
           the harbour and town square. He steps out. 

           From the balcony he can see EMMA dozing against their luggage, 
           her face turned towards the sun. She pulls the straps down on her 
           summer dress, exposing her shoulders.

                                 DEXTER
                        We will need two rooms. 

                                 LANDLADY
                        Okay, I have second room.

                                 DEXTER
                        So you do have two rooms?

                                 LANDLADY
                        Sure, two rooms. No problem.

           DEXTER turns, looks at the double bed. He sits on it, bounces 
           experimentally. 

           INT. GUEST HOUSE BEDROOM, GREEK ISLAND - DAY

           EMMA sits on this bed, suitcase by her side.  

                                 DEXTER
                        She only has one room. 

                                 EMMA
                        Ah. 

                                 DEXTER
                                (an exasperated sigh)
                        I know! What can I do?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        But what about the Rules?

                                 DEXTER
                        Perhaps we should see them more as 
                        ...guidelines?
                                (EMMA frowns)
                        I don’t mind if you don’t mind - 

                                 EMMA
                        No, I know you don’t mind -  

                                 DEXTER
                        Fine! Fine, I’ll tell her we don’t want it, keep 
                        looking - 

           EMMA opens the doors out onto the balcony.  

                                 EMMA
                        Lemons. Actually in trees. Never seen that 
                        before. They look stuck on.
                                (to DEX)
                        It’s perfect. Thank you.

           EXT. BEACH, GREEK ISLAND - DAY

           The beach is perfect too, just three or four other tourists. With 
           a whoop, DEXTER hurls himself into the water. EMMA, in her summer 
           dress, watches and smiles.  

           The beach is not a natural environment for EM. She unlaces her 
           Doctor Marten boots. DEX returns, handsome and tanned - 

                                 DEXTER
                        Excuse me, but aren’t you the Girl from Ipanema? 

                                 EMMA
                        No, I’m her fat Aunt.

           Lifting her summer dress over her head, EMMA catches DEXTER’s 
           eye. She wears a conservative but stylish black one-piece 
           swimsuit. She sits and starts to apply thick white lotion.

                                 DEXTER
                        What is that?

                                 EMMA
                        My swimsuit. It’s called ‘The Edwardian’.

                                 DEXTER
                        No, the house-paint.

                                 EMMA
                        Factor 40. I burn!

           She’s struggling to reach her back.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        Here, let me...

           A moment, then she shuffles between his knees, her back to him as 
           he applies the thick cream. A situation. By way of distraction, 
           EM grabs his ankle; a small tattoo.

                                 EMMA
                        I’ve not seen this before. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I got it in Thailand. It’s a yin-yang. 

                                 EMMA
                        Looks like a road-sign.

                                 DEXTER
                        It means ‘the perfect union of opposites.’ 

                                 EMMA
                        It means ‘end of national speed-limit’. It means 
                        wear some socks.  

                                 DEXTER
                                (he laughs, his hand on the base of 
                                 her spine)
                        Scooped quite low, isn’t it?

                                 EMMA
                        Good job I didn’t put it on backwards. 

           They both wince; a kind of delicious agony.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Think I’ll go for a dip.

           And she stands and walks self-consciously towards the sea, her 
           hand instinctively reaching round to adjust the material at the 
           backside of her costume. 

           On EM - Oh God!

           On DEX - Oh God!

           EXT. BEACH, GREEK ISLAND - DAY

           Later now. EMMA is reading Dostoyevsky, DEX is failing to  read a 
           copy of ‘The Face’. Something is distracting him - 

                                 DEXTER
                        This is a nudist beach. 

                                 EMMA
                        No it’s not. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        It is. Look -

           She does so. Sure enough, three other couples are naked. 

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        They’re barbecuing!

                                 EMMA
                        You see I couldn’t do that. Barbecue naked.

                                 DEXTER
                        Prude.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not a prude. Basic health and safety.

                                 DEXTER
                        I’d barbecue naked. 

                                 EMMA
                        What’s it like on the Wild Side? Your magazine’s 
                        upside down.
                                (he corrects this, goes back to 
                                 reading. A beat)
                        I can hear you thinking. It’s like this grinding 
                        noise. The answer is no -

                                 DEXTER
                        Just seems rude not to somehow. Everyone else is 
                        doing it!

                                 EMMA
                        That’s no reason. That’s how fascism started. 

                                 DEXTER
                        You don’t think we’d feel more comfortable 
                        naked?

                                 EMMA
                        Un-believable, just unbelievable -

                                 DEXTER
                        But why not?

                                 EMMA
                        The Rules! Not to mention your girlfriend -

                                 DEXTER
                        Ingrid’s very open-minded. She’d’ve had her top 
                        off at the check-in desk. 

                                 EMMA
                        Well I’m not Ingrid. 

                                 DEXTER
                        What’s the difference? 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        Well as you keep pointing out, Ingrid was a 
                        model.

                                 DEXTER
                        So? You could be a model. For catalogues or 
                        something.

           EMMA laughs, swipes at DEXTER with her book.

           EXT. VILLAGE/HARBOUR - DAY

           Tanned, tired, they walk slowly back to their room. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Of course it’s nothing we’ve not seen before.

                                 EMMA
                        Can we change the subject? 

                                 DEXTER
                        That night. After graduation. Our one night of 
                        love. I’m just saying we’ve got no surprises, 
                        genitally speaking.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m going to be sick - 

                                 DEXTER
                        You must remember though - 

                                 EMMA
                        I’ve blanked it out, like a car-crash. 

                          DEXTER
                                                        EMMA
                                             Don’t do that - stop please 
                                             - 
           I haven’t. In fact if I 
           close my eyes, I can still 
           picture you -

                                 DEXTER
                        Yep, there you are, provocatively unclasping 
                        your dungarees -

                                 EMMA
                        I was not wearing dungarees. 

                                 DEXTER
                        You do remember then. 

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t remember.
                                (they walk a little further)
                        Have I caught the sun?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           She closes her eyes, turns her face to him for inspection. DEXTER 
           takes her in.

                                 DEXTER
                        You look...fine. 

           INT. TAVERNA, GREEK ISLAND - NIGHT

           EMMA and DEXTER, both glowing and a little drink, sit at a 
           pleasant beach-side taverna. The WAITER pours ouzo. 

                                 EMMA
                                (to the WAITER, in Greek)
                        Ef-hah-rees-toh po-lee!

                                 WAITER
                                (delighted)
                        Ah, mee-lo kah-lee?

                                 EMMA
                        Eh-lee nee-kah, eh-lee nee-kah.
                                (enchanted, the WAITER leaves. EM 
                                 shrugs)
                        I bought a tape. 

           And now a new arrival. A GIRL, clutching a pen and paper, her 
           GIRLFRIENDS nearby watching, giggling.

                                 GIRL
                        You’re that presenter, aren’t you? Off Largin’
                        It!

                                 DEXTER
                        Guilty as charged!

                                 GIRL
                        Could you? To ‘Sam’?
                                (he signs)
                        Can I just say I think you’re brilliant.

                                 DEXTER
                        Yes, Sam, you can say that.

                                 GIRL
                                (to EM)
                        You are a very lucky lady.

                                 EMMA
                        I know! I keep pinching myself.

           SAM giggles, and goes back to her pals.

                                 DEXTER
                                (with studied nonchalance)
                        Well - that was weird!
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        It’s not going to change you, is it? Being very, 
                        very, very slightly famous.

                                 DEXTER
                                (the GIRLS are waving)
                        I wouldn’t say I was ‘famous’ exactly.

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter, you’ve interviewed MC Hammer.
                                (the GIRLS are staring)
                        If you want to join your friends -

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m happy here. We should toast. 

                                 EMMA
                        Okay. To your success.

                                 DEXTER
                        No. To us. To Em and Dex.

           They clink glasses, drink, wince...

           EXT. VILLAGE/HARBOUR - NIGHT

           And now they’ve taken the bottle of ouzo, and are sitting on the 
           harbour wall.

                                 EMMA
                        Awkward silence! 

                                 DEXTER
                        Not awkward. Comfortable
                                (beat)
                        Hey, I’ve got an idea.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not skinny-dipping -

                                 DEXTER
                        Let’s tell each other something we don’t know. A 
                        secret. 

                                 EMMA
                        Well this is going to end in tears. 

                                 DEXTER
                        You first.

                                 EMMA
                        Really? Oh God. A secret.
                                (she downs her ouzo)
                        Right, here we go - 
                                (she makes her eyes sultry; her 
                                 seduction-face)
                                      (MORE)
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                      EMMA (CONT'D)
                        When we were at University, before we spoke 
                        even, I used to see you around and...I had a 
                        crush on you. Ridiculous, I know, but when we 
                        almost, you know, did it that night, I couldn’t 
                        believe it ‘At last’! I was nuts about you all 
                        that summer, wrote poems and everything...

                                 DEXTER
                        Poems? Really?

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not proud of myself. Anyway. There you go.  
                        My big secret. What have you got to say to - 

                                 DEXTER
                        I already knew.

                                 EMMA
                                (horribly let down)
                        What d’you mean you knew?

                                 DEXTER
                        Tilly told me. Also I sort of guessed; all those 
                        long heartfelt letters...
                                (EM fixes her smile)
                        So what happened, what went wrong? 

                                 EMMA
                                (a shrug)
                        I got to know you. You cured me of you. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I still want to read these poems. What rhymes 
                        with Dexter?

                                 EMMA
                        Prick. It’s a half-rhyme.

           Her confession hasn’t gone nearly as well as she hoped. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t like this game anymore. Too much ouzo. 
                        We should go home. 

                                 DEXTER
                                (remorseful, making amends)
                        Not yet. Let’s go for a walk, shall we?

           EXT. BEACH, GREEK ISLAND - NIGHT

           They walk in silence along the beach, stopping at the sea’s edge; 
           an exquisite phosphorescent glow.

                                 DEXTER
                        Ah - the Mediterranean.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        The Aegean, technically. It’s still lovely 
                        though. S’like an aquarium. S’like if you 
                        scooped it up it would glow in your hands. 
                                (beat)
                        Bloody hell, I am drunk.

           But DEX has an idea. He starts to undress.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, ‘ello. What’s going on here? 

                                 DEXTER
                        A swim, to sober us up. 

                                 EMMA
                        But I haven’t got my...oh, oh, I get it. I’ve 
                        walked right into it, haven’t I? You get a girl 
                        drunk, lead her to a large body of water... 

                                 DEXTER
                        Be spontaneous, be reckless!  Live! 
                                (naked now)
                        So. Are you coming or not?

                                 EMMA
                                (averting her eyes)
                        No!

                                 DEXTER
                        Em, you are such a prude. Why are you such a 
                        prude?

           And he runs into the surf, EM watching his naked back.

                                 EMMA
                        You could at least leave your underpants on! 
                        Rule Number Four, remember? 
                                (swaying, alone)
                        Prude, am I? Yes, I am. Well we’ll see...

           And she reaches down, and with a giggly stagger, pulls her dress 
           over her head. 

           Out to sea, DEX turns just in time to see naked EMMA stumble 
           forward into the sea. He gathers his thoughts as she splashes 
           towards him - 

           And they’re together, breathless, naked beneath the water.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        So, this is skinny-dipping! What am I meant to 
                        do, sort of lark about? Splash you or something?
                                (she does so. DEX takes her hand)
                        Oh. That’s a very serious face. Hey, you’re not 
                        having a wee are you?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        I just wanted to say, I felt the same. When we 
                        had our...near-miss. I mean I didn’t write poems
                        or anything, I’m not insane, but I thought about 
                        you. Think about you. You and me. 

                                 EMMA
                                (her heart racing)
                        Really? Okay. Right, well...

                                 DEXTER
                        Problem is I fancy pretty much everyone!

                                 EMMA
                                (smile frozen)
                        Oh. I see. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I mean anyone! It’s like I’ve just got out of 
                        prison all the time. Walking down the street, I 
                        see a glimpse of bra-strap and I’m stupid with 
                        it. Everybody’s my type! It’s a real problem.

                                 EMMA
                        I can imagine.

                                 DEXTER
                        This thing, with Ingrid, it’s a sex thing. It’s 
                        just sex, sex, sex, sex -

                                 EMMA
                        - yes, the point’s been made Dex -

                                 DEXTER
                        - but you and me, well, it would be different. I 
                        think we’d want different things, and I don’t 
                        think I’m ready. 

                                 EMMA
                        Fine. Forget I mentioned it.
                                (feeling foolish)
                        Has it got cold? Think I’ll head back. 

                                 DEXTER
                        However! If you wanted to, you know - have a bit 
                        of fun -
                                (taking her hand)
                        A fling, no obligation, not a word to anyone, 
                        well - I’d be up for it.

                                 EMMA
                        Up for it.

                                 DEXTER
                        Yes. Up for it. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           A long moment. EMMA puts her hand to his face - then pushes it 
           under water. She stands there, holding DEX’s head beneath the 
           surface, ignoring his splashes, until she has gathered herself - 

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        So that’s a no, then.

                                 EMMA
                        I think so. I think our moment’s passed.

                                 DEXTER
                        Really? Because I think we’d feel much better if 
                        we got it out of the way!

                                 EMMA
                        - sort of like having your tonsils out -

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m not expressing myself very clearly - 

                                 EMMA
                        No, you are. That’s the problem. 
                                (he’s peering over her shoulder)
                        I like you, Dex, God knows why, but -

                                 DEXTER
                        OIIIIIIIIII!

           Now DEXTER is stumbling past her, heading towards the beach, 
           where a group of TEENAGE BOYS are running off with his clothes, 
           laughing, trousers waved like a flag...

           EM watches as DEXTER chases them into the night. 

           EXT. BEACH, GREEK ISLAND - NIGHT

           As EMMA gets dressed, DEXTER walks back towards her, hand clasped 
           between his legs.

                                 EMMA
                        Any luck?

                                 DEXTER
                        Nothing! Armani, those trousers. Little bastards 
                        even took my underpants. 

                                 EMMA
                        Armani?

                                 DEXTER
                        Gucci.

                                 EMMA
                        Dex, I am so sorry -
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        What kind of bastard steals someone’s 
                        underpants? 

                                 EMMA
                        There’s no justification for it -

                                 DEXTER
                        Bastard!

                                 EMMA
                        - thank God you still have your flip-flops.

                                 DEXTER
                        You know how I’m going to find him? I’m going to 
                        look for the only well-dressed kid on this whole 
                        bloody island...
                                (EM’s shoulders are shaking with 
                                 suppressed laughter)
                        It’s not funny! Look at me! I’m a victim of 
                        crime!

                                 EMMA
                        I’m sorry, it’s just...now I remember!

           And she’s in hysterics now, curled up on the sand.

           And now DEXTER himself is laughing. He sits on the sand behind 
           her, as they laugh and laugh and laugh...

           EXT. VILLAGE/HARBOUR - NIGHT

           They walk as nonchalantly as possible through the busy harbour, 
           DEXTER struggling to maintain his dignity with a plastic bag held 
           around his waist. 

           INT. GUEST HOUSE BEDROOM, GREECE - NIGHT

           They lie in chaste parallel, both staring upwards.

                                 EMMA
                        Dex?

                                 DEXTER
                        Em.

                                 EMMA
                        Your Gucci underpants. They’ll turn up, I know
                        they will.
                                (DEX narrows his eyes)
                        And I’m glad I’m here.

           He smiles, and she turns the light out. 

                                                                  CUT TO BLACK:
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER (O.S.)
                        God, I love you, Em. Just so, so much. I 
                        think I always have...

           INT. CLUB, BRIXTON, LONDON - NIGHT

           Music up: YOU’VE GOT THE LOVE by CANDI STANTON. DEXTER is on a 
           pay-phone, high on ecstasy. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I think you’re just...incredible.

           CAPTION; 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER.

           INT. EMMA’S FLAT, EARLS COURT - DAWN

           EMMA sits in her dressing-gown in the kitchen of her new flat, a 
           mug of tea in her hand.

                                 EMMA
                        And I’m touched, Dex, but you’re off your face. 
                        It’s five in the morning, go home, you’ve got a 
                        big day -

           INT. CLUB, BRIXTON, LONDON - DAWN

                                 DEXTER
                        Hey, how come we’ve never got together? We’d be 
                        great, Em and Dex, Dex and Em, everyone says 
                        so...

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Dex, I’m serious. Promise me you’ll go home. 
                        Please?

           A PRETTY GIRL has arrived, and is snaking her arm around DEX, 
           massaging his shoulders. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I will. Goodnight, Em. And remember, you are 
                        absolutely truly amazing.
                                (He hangs up. To the GIRL)
                        Hellooooooo!

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        Helloooooo!

                                 DEXTER
                        You are absolutely amazing. 

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        No, you’re amazing. And famous!
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        Well not famous...

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        But you are! You’re amazing.

                                 DEXTER
                        No, you’re amazing. Who are you?

           INT. CLUB, BRIXTON, LONDON - DAWN

           DEXTER dancing with the GIRL in the arches of the club, eyes 
           closed, lost in the music, out of his mind - 

           Jump cut; DEXTER signs his autograph on the bare belly of THE 
           GIRL. They start to kiss -  

           INT. BATHROOM, DEXTER’S FLAT - DAY

           DEXTER stands beneath the jet of the shower, eyes closed, his 
           face haunted and pale - the come-down.

           INT. DEXTER’S FLAT, BELSIZE PARK - DAY

           A bachelor’s paradise, stuffed with high-end hi-fi, an immense 
           TV, stacks of CDs, mixing-desks. DEXTER opens the fridge door, 
           pours orange juice, vodka - a lot of vodka. He goes to drink. He 
           notices his hand is shaking -

           Now dressed in a smart shirt, DEXTER is already sweating. By the 
           door is a gift-wrapped parcel and a VHS cassette. He grabs these 
           and leaves.

           INT. SPORTS CAR, MOTORWAY - DAY

           Teeth clenched, perspiring, DEXTER drives at speed. He blinks 
           once, twice, jabs at the CD player. Dance music - 

           The blare of a horn. A lorry bears down him, just metres away. 
           DEXTER is driving in the middle of two lanes. He swerves, loses 
           control, knuckles white on the wheel - 

           EXT. MOTORWAY - DAY

           DEXTER is parked on the hard shoulder, breathing fast. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           EXT. MAYHEW FAMILY HOME, OXFORDSHIRE - DAY

           A comfortable upper-middle-class home in leafy Oxfordshire - 
           DEXTER sits in the car and regards it with dread. His father 
           approaches. DEXTER stumbles out to greet him.

           STEVEN MAYHEW is usually mild-mannered but deeply troubled now. 
           DEXTER’s clumsy, inappropriate embrace startles him - 

                                 DEXTER
                        How are you, old man?

                                 STEVEN
                        Your mother’s in the garden. She’s been waiting 
                        for you all morning. Good God, you’re sweating. 
                        Why are you sweating?

                                 DEXTER
                        How is she?

           INT/EXT. GARDEN, MAYHEW HOME - DAY

           DEXTER steps out into the bright day.

           ALISON MAYHEW sits looking out over her large, pleasant garden. 
           As DEXTER approaches, it becomes clear that she is now very 
           frail, very thin. Cancer has taken a terrible toll. Even so, she 
           smiles at seeing her son approach. 

                                 DEXTER
                                (holding it together)
                        Hellooo there!

                                 ALISON
                        Hello stranger. You’re sweating. 

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s a hot day.
                                (the parcel)
                        A present. Not from me, I’m afraid. From Emma.

                                 ALISON
                        I could tell because it’s wrapped. Yours come in 
                        bin liners. When they come at all-
                                (She opens the parcel - a pile of 
                                 novels.)
                        How lovely. A little ambitious maybe. You might 
                        want to push her towards short stories in 
                        future.

                                 DEXTER
                        Mum. Don’t.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 ALISON
                        Thank Emma for me. And you? What have you been 
                        up to? 

           DEXTER holds up a video cassette...

           INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

           An outrageous, late-night TV show - Largin’ It; girls in 
           bikinis are deluged with brightly-coloured sludge.

           A grinning DEXTER looks on.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MAYHEW HOUSE - DAY

           DEXTER and ALISON watch the VHS of the above, deeply 
           uncomfortable. 

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s not all like this...
                                (fast forwarding)
                        I’ll skip this next bit. There’s an interview 
                        that’s pretty good...

           Fast-forwarded images, garish and bright. 

                                 ALISON
                        Perhaps I’ll watch it later.

           She turns the TV off. An awkward silence. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Just a bit of fun. Live shows are always patchy - 

                                 ALISON
                        I understand. And you’re very good, 
                        very...natural. I suppose I just don’t care for 
                        this sort of thing. Honestly, Dexter, dancing 
                        girls in cages...

                                 DEXTER
                        Well it’s not really for people like you.

                                 ALISON
                        ‘People like me’?

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s a bit of fun for kids, to watch after the 
                        pub -

                                 ALISON
                        You mean I’m not drunk enough?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        No, not that - 

                                 ALISON
                        I’m not a prude, Dexter, I just don’t like 
                        seeing people humiliated.

                                 DEXTER
                        No-one’s humiliated! It’s fun!

                                 ALISON
                        You keep saying it’s fun, are you trying to 
                        convince me or yourself?

                                 DEXTER
                        I just host it! I smile and I ask pop stars 
                        about their exciting-new-video. It’s a means to 
                        an end, that’s all.

                                 ALISON
                        But to what end? We always said you could do 
                        anything you wanted. I just never thought 
                        you’d want to do this. 

                                 DEXTER
                        What do you want me to do? 

                                 ALISON
                        Something good. 

                                 DEXTER
                        It is good! In it’s own terms -

                                 ALISON
                        But you wanted to be a photographer, you 
                        wanted to make documentaries -

                                 DEXTER
                        But this is what I can do. I’m good at it, and I 
                        enjoy it. 

                                 ALISON
                        Well you must do what you enjoy. 
                                (conciliatory)
                        And I know you’ll do other things, in time...
                                (pause)
                        Let’s not argue. I’m sorry, the medication makes 
                        me ratty. I’ll be better tonight.

                                 DEXTER
                        Actually, I have to leave this afternoon.
                                (ALISON takes this in)
                        I have a premiere tonight. I can’t skip it, it’s 
                        Jurassic Park! 

                                 ALISON
                        Well. The life you lead! 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           She goes to stand. DEXTER leaps to help her.

                                 ALISON (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid I’m going to need some help.

           INT. HALLWAY, MAYHEW HOME - DAY

           DEXTER carries ALISON upstairs, awkward, self-conscious.

                                 ALISON
                        My hero.

           INT. ALISON’S BEDROOM, MAYHEW HOME - DAY

           ALISON lies on her side in the darkened room.

                                 DEXTER
                        Can I get you anything? Water? Dry martini?

                                 ALISON
                        Just close the curtains.

           He does so. Then tries to find something to say. Then goes.

           INT. DEXTER’S BEDROOM, MAYHEW HOUSE - DAY

           DEXTER lies asleep in his childhood bedroom, evening sunlight 
           on his face. He opens his eyes, sees his teenage photographic 
           project still pinned to the wall; pretentious black and white 
           close-ups of gravel, rows of shoes. He smiles to himself. 

           Then he sees the clock radio by the bed - 1815. He swears, 
           sits suddenly -

           ALISON is at the end of the bed, watching over him.

                                 ALISON
                        Sleeping beauty.

                                 DEXTER
                        I must have dozed off.

                                 ALISON
                        I’m afraid you’ve missed our day. You’re 
                        father’s a little angry with you.

                                 DEXTER
                        Seems everyone is.

                                 ALISON
                        Poor Dexter.
                                (pats the bed next to her)
                                      (MORE)
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                      ALISON (CONT'D)
                        I’m not angry with you. Not just you. I’m angry 
                        with everyone who isn’t sick.

                                 DEXTER
                        I’ll stay tonight. 

                                 ALISON
                        No, you go. That’s no pleasure for me, watching 
                        you and your father snarling at each other. I 
                        want us to have fun. We’ve always had fun, 
                        haven’t we?
                                (her head on his shoulder)
                        Can I speak frankly?

                                 DEXTER
                        Do you have to?

                                 ALISON
                        I think so. I think it’s my prerogative.
                        I know that you’re going to be a fine 
                        young man; decent, loving, accomplished. 
                        Happy, because that’s all a mother can 
                        really ask for. 
                                (she takes his hand)
                        But I don’t think you’re there yet. I 
                        think you’ve got quite some way to go, 
                        and right now I worry...well, that 
                        you’re not very nice anymore.

           DEXTER takes this in.

                                 DEXTER
                        There’s nothing I can say to that. 

                                 ALISON
                        There is nothing that you have to.

           And they sit there in silence.

           EXT. VILLAGE TRAIN STATION - DAY

           A simmering STEVEN has dropped DEXTER at the station.

                                 DEXTER
                        I think you’re being ridiculous. You can’t 
                        confiscate my car keys.

                                 STEVEN
                        I’m not going to argue. You can come back at the 
                        weekend, sober, and get the car then. There’s a 
                        train at 7.15.

                                 DEXTER
                        Fine. Though I would just like to say you’re 
                        completely over-reacting -

           And his father snaps -
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 STEVEN
                        Do not dare to insult my intelligence! You are 
                        not a child, so stop behaving like one.
                                (DEXTER shocked.)
                        Your mother loves you very much, and I do too, 
                        you know that. But in whatever time she has left 
                        to her...
                                (his voice breaks)
                        If you ever, ever, come and see your mother in 
                        this state again I will not let you in the 
                        house. I will close the door in your face. I 
                        mean this. Now. Go.

           And he crunches the car into gear and drives off. Shaken, DEXTER 
           watches him go.

           INT. HALLWAY, EMMA’S FLAT, EARLS COURT - DAY

           EMMA inspects herself in the hallway mirror, all dressed up. 

           She tries a smile, which makes her frown. Despite her scowls, she 
           looks wonderful. She hurries out - 

           INT. COMMUNAL HALLWAY, EMMA’S FLAT - CONTINUOUS

           - walks towards the lift, then hears the phone ring. Should she 
           answer? She checks her watch again - no time. She hurries off to 
           the lift. The answering machine -

                                 DEXTER (O.S.)
                        ...pick up, pick up. You’re not there. I just 
                        remembered, it’s your hot date tonight isn’t it? 
                        I’m too late.

           The lift door closes.

           EXT. VILLAGE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Pale, shaken, heavy with self-loathing, DEXTER speaks urgently 
           into the phone. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Call me when you get this, I...well, I just want 
                        to talk to someone. Not someone, you. I’m sorry, 
                        another lunatic phone-call. It’s just I’ve done 
                        something so bad, Em. Call me. Hope the date 
                        goes well. You heartbreaker, you.

           He hangs up, then hangs his head. A wreck.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           INT. CINEMA - DAY

           Screams. A sword neatly decapitates a zombie, sending the head 
           flying.

           The movie is Evil Dead 3; Army of Darkness. EMMA winces, a little 
           bemused. In the seat next to her, IAN WHITEHEAD, her old 
           colleague from the restaurant, whoops and tucks into an immense 
           bucket of popcorn.

           EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

           They leave the cinema. IAN wears his stand-up uniform - old T-
           shirt, jacket with sleeves rolled up, razor burn.

                                 IAN
                        A work of timeless beauty. A chainsaw for an arm 
                        - mad! If I had one criticism, I’d say that it 
                        wasn’t violent enough. Hey, you didn’t mind, did 
                        you? Or did you want to see Three Colours Blue?

                                 EMMA
                        No, I enjoyed it. It was...fun.

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT, LONDON - NIGHT

           EM reads the menu in a classic ‘date restaurant’.

                                 IAN
                        Now I’m going to skip a starter ‘cause I had 
                        those nachos, but you go ahead, my treat, have 
                        anything you want, up to a value of, say, 
                        £14.00? No, seriously, have anything. Don’t go 
                        crazy but, you know, within reason. Sorry! 
                        Burbling on. It’s just, it’s so good to see you 
                        again after all these years!
                                (he hugs her across the table, 
                                 knocking over various bottles, 
                                 glasses..)
                        I did leave you messages. I wrote too, several 
                        times...

                                 EMMA
                        Well I’ve been busy, with the course...

                                 IAN
                        And you’re going to be an amazing teacher. Wish 
                        I’d had teachers like you. Not that I’d’ve got 
                        any work done, Miss Morley!

           INT. DEXTER’S FLAT, BELSIZE PARK - NIGHT

           DEXTER, home now, checks his answering machine. ‘You have NO 
           messages’. He sighs, looks up. The bottle of vodka is where he 
           left it that morning -

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT, LONDON - NIGHT

           Onto the second bottle of wine, but no more relaxed - 

                                 EMMA
                        How’s the stand-up comedy?

                                 IAN
                        Oh, you know - bit hit and miss as usual. I’ve 
                        been doing this improv comedy night, where 
                        people shout out suggestions and sometimes I 
                        find myself just...standing there. Frozen. And 
                        of course people heckle and someone threw a 
                        glass last week but then that’s all part of the 
                        fun of improv, isn’t it?
                                (EMMA looks unsure)
                        I think I might give it up, stick to the more 
                        observational stuff. Like I do this whole 
                        routine about the difference between cats and 
                        dogs, how dogs come up to you and they’re all 
                        like -

                                 EMMA
                        Please, stop! 
                                (IAN is a little thrown)
                        Sorry, I mean you don’t have to. Be funny. We 
                        can just..talk.

                                 IAN
                        What d’you want to talk about?

                                 EMMA
                        Whatever occurs to you.

           A long silence. 

                                 IAN
                        Nope. Dried! All gone. Not an idea in my head. 
                        I’m no good at this -

                                 EMMA
                        Ian -

                                 IAN
                        You know the worst thing about being a stand-up 
                        comedian?

                                 EMMA
                        Is it the clothes?

                                 IAN
                        It’s that people always expect you to be ‘on’. 
                        Because if you’re not being funny, what are you 
                        being? And I’ve been so excited about seeing 
                        you, so nervous, I’ve been practicing and 
                        practicing...

                                 EMMA
                        Practicing?

                                 IAN
                        Observations, little remarks, quips -

                                 EMMA
                        Ian, it’s not a performance.

                                 IAN
                        Except it sort of is, isn’t it?

                                 EMMA
                        Not with me. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t want 
                        to be.
                                (she takes his hand)
                        It’s nice to see you again, Ian.

                                 IAN
                        Emma Morley, can I just say something?

                                 EMMA
                        Go on.

                                 IAN
                        I think you’re the absolute bollocks.

                                 EMMA
                                (she smiles)
                        You with your honeyed words.

           INT. DEXTER’S FLAT, BELSIZE PARK - NIGHT

           DEXTER returns to the fridge for more vodka, phone pressed to 
           his ear, pretty drunk now.

                                 DEXTER
                        Pick up, pick up, pick up! I’m home now. Call 
                        me as soon as you get back. How’s the date 
                        going? Is he making you laugh? Is he laughing 
                        you into bed? 

           He pours yet more vodka - no orange this time.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET, LONDON - NIGHT

           IAN and EMMA walk along, having a much better time now.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER (O.S.)
                        I want to know! I want to see you, Em. Call 
                        anytime. I’ll be waiting for you.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m going to be one of those inspirational 
                        teachers, like in films. One of those seize-the-
                        day-types, sat astride a chair, talking about 
                        how Shakespeare was the first rapper and the 
                        kids are just going to gaze up, adoring. That’s 
                        the idea anyway. They’ll probably eat me alive, 
                        the little sods.

           The summer night has clouded over -

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        It’s starting to rain.

                                 IAN
                        Sorry about that.

                                 EMMA
                        Ian, I’m pretty sure it’s not your fault. I 
                        should head home. 

                                 IAN
                        Don’t go! I mean...let’s go somewhere else. I 
                        live quite near. It’s a dump actually, just 
                        awful, but there’s music, alcohol, hot milky 
                        drink if you prefer.  

           On EMMA’s decision, rain coming down harder now -

           A phone rings. An answering machine picks up.

                                 DEXTER (O.S.)
                        Okay, just coming up to midnight now.

           INT. DEXTER’S FLAT, BELSIZE PARK - NIGHT

           DEXTER lies on the sofa, a bottle of vodka open at his side. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Call me any time. I’m not going anywhere. Or 
                        just come round - 
                                (the doorbell rings)
                        Maybe that’s you now. Christ I hope so...

           And with the phone pressed against his chest, he stumbles down 
           the hallway and opens the door - 

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                                (on the phone)
                        Some other time maybe.

           He hangs up -
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           REVEAL: INGRID is there, cool and aloof, straight from a 
           party, her hair and dress wet from the rain. 

           Without a word, lifting her dress over her head, INGRID walks 
           towards the bedroom.

           DEXTER follows without a word.

           INT. EMMA’S FLAT, EARLS COURT - DAY

           EMMA wakes in her double-bed - alone. 6.30 a.m. 
           A clock radio clicks on. The morning news; the war in Yugoslavia, 
           O.J. Simpson.

           A working day, she gets up, shuffles bleary-eyed to - 

           INT. HALLWAY/BATHROOM - DAY

           IAN is sat on the toilet, reading ‘Watchmen’. 

                                 IAN
                        Won’t be a sec...

           EMMA closes the door, sighs.

           CAPTION; 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER.

           INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

           The beginning of rehearsals for DEXTER’s new TV show. DEXTER is 
           running through his script, coffee in hand -

                                 DEXTER
                        ‘Greetings boys and girls,  and welcome to 
                        Late and Loud, the show that’s late and, 
                        well, loud! And what a show we’ve got for you 
                        -

           A STAGE MANAGER arrives, with a guest -

                                 STEVEN
                        I’ve helped myself to tea and buns, I hope I’m 
                        not going to get you into trouble.

           His father looks even more out of place amongst the cables, the 
           cameras, the dancing girls.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Well, this is all most impressive, I must say. 
                        Your very own television show.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           From the other side of the studio, a bellow of WAAAHAY! His co-
           presenter, professionally ‘bubbly’ SUKI MEADOWS, has leapt into 
           the arms of AARON, their agent.

                                 DEXTER
                        There’s Suki too. You should meet Suki.

                                 STEVEN
                        No, I don’t want to get in anyone’s way. I just 
                        wanted to call by, say good luck. Your mother 
                        would’ve been...most impressed. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Thanks, dad.

                                 STEVEN
                        I’ll be watching if I can stay awake. Have fun, 
                        and don’t pay any attention to what they say in 
                        the papers.

           On DEXTER - pardon?

           INT. BUS, NORTH LONDON - DAY

           C.U. A photo of DEXTER, a headline;

                          IS THIS THE MOST ANNOYING MAN ON TELEVISION?

           EMMA stands on the packed bus, reading the newspaper, IAN peering 
           over her shoulder, gleeful.

                                 IAN
                        They’ve got a point haven’t they?

                                 EMMA
                        Ian! Be nice. 

                                 IAN
                        Well I never liked him.

                                 EMMA
                        Yes you’ve said that. Many, many times.

                                 IAN
                                (the bus stops)
                        Now, you on the other hand -
                                (a kiss)
                        Love you, snootch.

                                 EMMA
                        I thought we agreed to drop ‘snootch’?

                                 DEXTER
                        But you’re just so damn snootchy! 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                                (sceptical)
                        Is that right?

           IAN squeezes out of the bus. EMMA returns to the headline.

           INT. TV STUDIO, LONDON - DAY

           DEXTER talks on the phone, the newspaper in front of him.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        It’s not completely negative.

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m ‘the king of car-crash television.’ 

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        But you’re the king of it. That’s good.

           INT. STAFF ROOM, COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL - DAY

           EMMA sits in the dingy staff room. Noticeably, she wears a pretty 
           vintage dress; a party dress.

                                 EMMA
                        Dex, I want you to take the newspaper now, tear 
                        it in half, and throw it away. 

                                 DEXTER (O.S.)
                        I wish you were coming tonight.

                                 EMMA
                        I can’t. You know I can’t -

                                 DEXTER (O.S.)
                        But you’re not here, mum’s not here. I’m worried 
                        I’m going to be live on air and I’ll just freeze 
                        and think - what’s the point? 

                                 EMMA
                        Hey come on, that’s enough. She would have been 
                        so proud, Dex.

           Another TEACHER runs in, MRS MAJOR, flustered.

                                 MRS MAJOR
                        Emma, come quickly! It’s like a zoo, you 
                        can’t leave them for one minute, not one 
                        minute. I said you were asking too much of 
                        them!
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           INT. TV STUDIO, LONDON - DAY

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        I’ve got to go, a riot’s broken out apparently. 
                        You’ll be fine, more than fine, you’ll be 
                        wonderful. Talk later...

           She’s gone. DEXTER sighs, drops the newspaper into a bin.

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           On the set of a production of ‘Oliver!’, two London urchins are 
           brawling. A crowd of KIDS in Victorian outfits, stick on beards 
           and side-burns, urge them on. 

                                 EMMA
                        Right, that’s enough...I said ENOUGH!

           The crowd quieten down. EMMA regards them all, a commander 
           inspecting her troops.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Look at you. Look at how great you look in your 
                        costumes. Look at Samir there with his stick-on 
                        beard
                                (KIDS laugh, SAMIR blushes.)

           She notices PHIL GODALMING, the headmaster, slide into the gym, 
           forty years-old, handsome. With studied informality, he sits 
           astride a chair.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        In one hour your mums and dads and teachers are 
                        going to be sitting here and I think they’re 
                        going to see something amazing. But only if we 
                        work together! Okay? I can’t hear you!

                                 KIDS
                        Yes, Miss Morley!

                                 EMMA
                        Now go finish getting ready, run your lines, be 
                        back here in ten minutes for a warm-up. And then 
                        let’s knock ‘em dead! 

           The KIDS disperse. MR GODALMING approaches. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Can’t believe I just said ‘knock ‘em dead’.

                                 MR GODALMING
                        Very inspirational.

                                 EMMA
                        This business we call ‘show’!
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 MR GODALMING
                        So what can we expect tonight, Emma?

                                 EMMA
                        Could go either way. They’re taking it very 
                        seriously. Oliver’s been in character for the 
                        last six weeks. I think if he could he’d have 
                        contracted rickets.

                                 MR GODALMING
                        We’ve not had a school play here for five 
                        years. No-one’s dared. I’m very grateful for 
                        your hard work. 

                                 EMMA
                        Thank you, headmaster. 

                                 MR GODALMING
                        Please - call me Phil. I seem to be sat 
                        astride this chair.

                                 EMMA
                        Yes, I noticed.

                                 MR GODALMING
                                (standing)
                        Sorry about that. Good luck tonight. I’ll see 
                        you at the party 
                                (he goes, then turns)
                        You look lovely by the way. The dress -

                                 EMMA
                                (a little flustered)
                        Oh. Thank you. 

           And he smiles and goes, leaving EM a little flustered.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM, TV STUDIO - NIGHT

           In his presenter’s outfit, DEXTER performs a delicate operation. 
           He takes a bottle of vodka and carefully decants it into a water 
           bottle. He takes a swig -

           - then hides the bottle just in time. A girl bursts into the 
           room, a ball of energy, boisterous, attractive, LOUD; his co-
           presenter SUKI MEADOWS. At speed - 

                                 SUKI
                        WAAHAY! There he is! The star of the show! Come 
                        here, gorgeous!
                                (wraps herself around him)
                        Are you excited? I’M excited. I’m PSYCHED! I’m 
                        MAD FOR IT! WHOOP-WHOOP!
                                (DEXTER flinches)
                        You alright?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m fine, you just whooped in my ear, so -

                                 SUKI
                        We’re going to be AMAZING, you and me. Dex and 
                        Suki, Suki and Dex. Come here - 

           A big kiss, DEXTER a little overwhelmed. Behind his back, she 
           grabs the bottle of water/vodka, and before DEX can stop her...

                                 DEXTER
                        Actually, Suki, that’s mine...

           Too late. SUKI is coughing, spluttering. Sombre now, she looks at 
           a shame-faced DEXTER.

                                 SUKI
                        Dex - are you pissed?

           A FLOOR-MANAGER arrives. 

                                 FLOOR-MANAGER
                        Dexter, Suki, you’re on - 

           He goes. SUKI is still glaring.

                                 DEXTER
                        Just to...loosen me up. I’m ready, I’m fine. I 
                        swear.

                                 SUKI
                        You’d better be. ‘Cause I’m not carrying you, 
                        pal.

           And she turns and walks away. Loud music up, as DEXTER walks out 
           with the solemn trudge of a condemned man. Applause, whooping, 
           cheering, as - 

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

           - the children take their bow at the end of the show. The 
           audience are on their feet, IAN leading the whooping and cheering 
           as EMMA is hoisted onto the shoulders of the young cast, beaming, 
           laughing. 

           In the audience, MR GODALMING watches and smiles, his wife FIONA 
           next to him. 

           INT. TV STUDIO, LONDON - NIGHT

           DEXTER is attempting to interview a HIP-HOP GROUP, but they’re 
           talking over him, the LEAD SINGER leering at the camera, 
           ignoring his questions. A close-up - behind the fixed smile, 
           there is panic in DEXTER’s eyes.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           INT. LIVING ROOM, EMMA’S FLAT, EARL’S COURT - NIGHT

           EMMA watches the above through her fingers, wincing. IAN stands 
           in the doorway just as the LEAD SINGER pours a glass of water 
           over DEXTER’s head. 

           EMMA presses pause, smiles. But too slow. IAN sees the face on 
           the screen - a flicker of jealousy.

                                 IAN
                        Turn that off, superstar. Come to bed... 

           He goes. EMMA glances at the screen; DEXTER frozen in his 
           humiliation. She turns the TV off.

           The sound of a smoke alarm, shrill, insistent.

           INT. SPARE ROOM, WALTHAMSTOW FLAT - DAY

           In the tiny spare room of her new flat, EMMA, scruffy in pyjamas, 
           works through a great pile of exercise books -

           CAPTION; 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER.

           - but the noise of the smoke alarm is too distracting.  

           INT. KITCHEN/DINER, WALTHAMSTOW FLAT  - DAY

           IAN stands on a chair in a smoke-filled kitchen, waving a tea-
           towel under the alarm. Bacon burns in a pan in a kitchen full of 
           packing cases. Paint pots, old newspapers. Stripped wallpaper 
           hangs forlornly off the walls. 

                                 EMMA
                        I thought you were stripping the wallpaper?

                                 IAN
                        I can have breakfast first can’t I?

                                 EMMA
                        We’ve had breakfast. 

                                 IAN
                        Fine. Brunch, then! How’s it going?

                                 EMMA
                        Thirty-four identical essays on Lord of 
                        the Flies.

                                 IAN
                        Bear hug, snootchy?
                                (EM raises her eyebrows)
                                      (MORE)
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                      IAN (CONT'D)
                        Sorry - slipped out. Can’t seem to say the right 
                        thing these days! 

           And he goes back to making his sandwich. With a sigh, EM goes and 
           puts her arms around his waist. 

                                 EMMA
                        If you don’t want me to go - 

                                 IAN
                        No, you go -

                                 EMMA
                        Or if you want to come with us - 

                                 IAN
                        Dexter ignoring me, you talking over me -

                                 EMMA
                        It won’t be like that - 

                                 IAN
                        Besides I’ve got a gig tonight, Mister Giggles 
                        at the Rose and Crown.

                                 EMMA
                        A paid gig?

                                 IAN
                        Yes, paid! You go out, have fun. Just don’t get 
                        off with him, will you?

                                 EMMA
                        Well, that’s hardly likely to happen, is it? 
                        He’s going out with Suki Meadows. 

                                 IAN
                        And if he wasn’t? 

                                 EMMA
                        It wouldn’t make the slightest bit of 
                        difference, because I love you.

                                 IAN
                        Do you?

                                 EMMA
                        Do I!
                                (but there’s something awkward, 
                                 unconvincing about this. Escape -)
                        Better get back to it then. 

                                 IAN
                        Em?
                                (She turns. IAN bites his sandwich.)
                        About seventeen hundred hours, fancy a spot of, 
                        you know, afternoon delight?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           She stands in the doorway, smiling, not sure what to say - 

           EXT. SOHO STREET, LONDON - NIGHT 

           EMMA, self-conscious in her party best, waits while DEXTER talks 
           on his mobile phone. 

                                 DEXTER
                                (on phone)
                        Suki, you mentalist! Yeah, I’ll see you at the 
                        par-tay, but my friend’s here now - Emma, you’ve 
                        met her - Yes you have! - You have! - Yes, that 
                        one. Whoop-whoop to you too. Got to go. Laters!
                                (to EMMA, finally -)
                        Hey you! Come here...

           An awkward half-embrace as DEXTER fiddles with his phone.

                                 EMMA
                                (the mobile phone)
                        You do know they give you brain damage. 

                                 DEXTER
                        They do not give you brain damage.

                                 EMMA
                        But how can you tell?

                                 DEXTER
                        Ha. It’s not 1988 anymore, Em. Six months, six 
                        months and you’ll have one.

                                 EMMA
                                (they shake on it)
                        You’re on. If I ever get a mobile phone, you can 
                        buy me dinner.

                                 DEXTER
                        What, again?
                                (an awkward beat)
                        You look amazing. Quite feminine.

                                 EMMA
                        Aw, thank you!

                                 DEXTER
                        And the shoes! 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s the world’s first orthopaedic high-heel. 
                                (He laughs. Relief)
                        So - where are you taking me?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           INT. SOHO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The cocktail lounge of an expensive Soho restaurant. EM stands 
           awkward and alone by the bar.

           Nearby DEXTER flirts outrageously with a CIGARETTE GIRL, 
           startlingly sexy in retro stockings and corset. 

           A CUSTOMER and his GIRLFRIEND approach her.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        We have a reservation for 8.15...

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, I’m not a waitress.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Oh, I’m sorry, I thought...

           And they dissolve into laughter, leaving just as DEX returns.

                                 EMMA
                        Who’s your new friend?

                                 DEXTER
                        Cigarette Girl. It’s sort of a retro-glam-thing. 
                        This place is famous for it.

                                 EMMA
                        What, women dressed as prostitutes?

                                 DEXTER
                        Well maybe her thick woolly tights are in the 
                        wash.
                                (drains his martini)
                        She doesn’t mind, she probably feels empowered. 
                        Post-feminist, isn’t it?

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, is that what we’re calling it now? 

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s not 1988 anymore, Em.

                                 EMMA
                        What does that mean? You keep saying it, and I 
                        still don’t know what it means. 

           The pretty COCKTAIL WAITRESS has arrived.

                                 DEXTER
                        Could we get two?- no, one more martini, 
                        Bombay Sapphire, very cold, very, very dry 
                        with a twist of lime. 
                                (to EMMA)
                        I’ve become something of a mixologist.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        Misogynist?

                                 DEXTER
                        Mixologist. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you said 
                        ‘misogynist’.

           A moment, while they stand there in awkward silence.

           INT. BOOTH, SOHO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           They’re in their booth now, DEXTER fidgety, coked-up.

                                 DEXTER
                        So. How’s the king of comedy?

                                 EMMA
                        Ian’s fine, we both are.

                                       DEXTER
                        Still very much in love?

                                 EMMA
                        He can belch the alphabet, why wouldn’t I be? 
                        I’m flesh and blood.

                        And your new house?

                                 EMMA
                        The flat’s brilliant. Well it’s a depressing 
                        dump actually, but it’s got loads 
                        of...potential. You should come up some time and 
                        see it.

                        How’s Suki?

                                 DEXTER
                        Fantastic. Gorgeous, mad, just this incredible 
                        ball of energy.

                                 EMMA
                        She’s certainly bubbly. 

                                 DEXTER
                        She is bubbly. And what’s great for me is she 
                        understands the industry, what it’s like to 
                        be..I was going to say famous, but I hate that

                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        Every time I turn on the telly, she’s there in a 
                        little spangly top shouting ‘wahay!’ She’s doing 
                        incredibly well. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Yeah, well we both are. 

           An awkward moment. Defensive -

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got lots of really exciting stuff coming 
                        up, but’s all in development; if I told you I’d 
                        have to kill you!

                                 EMMA
                        Please, do.

                                 DEXTER
                        Aaron, that’s our agent, he thinks I should take 
                        a break anyway. He’s worried there’s a danger 
                        I’ll be over-exposed.

                                 EMMA
                        I can see how that might happen.

                                 DEXTER
                        Start without me. 

           Standing suddenly, he takes his drink and goes.

                                 EMMA
                                (to herself)
                        Laters.

           EMMA sighs, lets her head fall forward into her hands. 

           INT. BOOTH, SOHO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           EMMA sits doing origami with her menu as the food gets cold. 
           Looking up, she sees DEXTER talking to the pretty CIGARETTE GIRL 
           again. He nods towards EM, touches the CIGARETTE GIRL on the arm, 
           gives her a slip of paper, then heads back and stumbles into his 
           seat. 

                                 EMMA
                        Maybe you’d like her to join us? Or she could 
                        sit here and I’ll go home - 

                                 DEXTER
                        Hey, I’m here to see you, remember? 

           EM picks at her food. For something to say -
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        How’s teaching?
                                (EMMA sighs)
                        What! What have I done now!

                                 EMMA
                        If you’re not interested, don’t ask!

                                 DEXTER
                        I am interested! I just thought you were going 
                        to write this novel - 

                                 EMMA
                        And I will, one day, but I also have to earn a 
                        living. More to the point I enjoy it. I’m a 
                        bloody good teacher, Dexter!

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m sure. Still you know what they say.

                                 EMMA
                        What do they say?

                                 DEXTER
                                (a little anxious now)
                        You know; ‘those who can...’

                                 EMMA
                        Sorry, I’m not familiar. Finish the sentence. 

           A stand-off. Finally - 

                                 DEXTER
                        Those who can, do, those who can’t, teach -

                                 EMMA
                        - and those who can teach say go fuck yourself.

           And she stands, and storms out, knocking over the drinks. 
           Swearing, mopping his suit, DEXTER follows.  

                                 DEXTER
                        Whatever I’ve done, I’m sorry!

                                 EMMA
                        What, you don’t know?

                                 DEXTER
                        This is stupid, you’re just a bit drunk -

           The following on the move, very fast. 

                                 EMMA
                        No, you’re drunk! I’ve not seen you sober for, 
                        what, three years? Nipping off to the toilet 
                        every ten minutes - either you’re on coke or 
                        you’ve got dysentery and either way it’s boring!

                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                      EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Banging on about yourself all the time, me, me, 
                        me. It’s like I’ve won a prize, a night out with 
                        Dexter Mayhew! I wouldn’t mind, but you’re a TV 
                        presenter, Dex. You’ve not invented penicillin, 
                        it’s TV, and crap TV at that. All you do is 
                        stand around shouting ‘make some noise’! 

           On the staircase now, she stumbles on her heels, the whole 
           restaurant watching. 

           She’s helped to her feet by the CIGARETTE GIRL. DEXTER, too, 
           takes her arm. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t touch me! Do NOT touch me!

           And fighting back tears, she heads out -

           EXT. STREET, SOHO - CONTINUOUS

           They push through the evening crowds into a quiet alley at the 
           side of the restaurant. Both take a deep breath.

                                 EMMA
                        Why are you being like this?

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m having fun, that’s all! A lot’s happened to 
                        me and sometimes I get ...carried away. If you 
                        weren’t so judgemental all the time...

                                 EMMA
                        Am I? I try not to be. And I know you’ve been 
                        through a lot, with your mum and all, 
                        but...there are things I needed to talk to you 
                        about, how I’m stuck in this terrible flat with 
                        a man who I love but I’m not in love with, and 
                        also I don’t even love, and if I can’t talk to 
                        you about these things, then what’s the point of 
                        you? Of us?

                                 DEXTER
                        ‘What’s the point’?

                                 EMMA
                        I think we’ve grown out of each other. No, 
                        you’ve grown out of me. You think I’m uncool and 
                        dreary...

                                 DEXTER
                        Em, I do not think you’re dreary. 

                                 EMMA
                        Neither do I! I think I’m fucking marvellous as 
                        a matter of fact, and you used to too. But if 
                        it’s over then maybe we should just face it. Say 
                        goodbye. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                                (with failing bravado)
                        It sounds like you’re dumping me. 

                                 EMMA
                        I suppose I am. You’re not who you used to be. I 
                        liked the old Dex. I want him back, but in the 
                        meantime...I’m sorry.

           Tearful now, she starts to walk away. To her back.

                                 DEXTER
                        Hey, come on Em. I apologise! Let’s start 
                        tonight again. Em? Please?

           And then suddenly she turns, runs back into his arms.

                                 EMMA
                                (whispers in his ear)
                        Dexter, I love you so much, so so much, more 
                        than you can ever know.
                                (she kisses him once)
                        I just don’t like you anymore. I’m sorry. 

           Then she runs back into the crowded street, and is gone. 

           DEXTER stands alone in the alley, unsure what to do next. 

           He turns, and a little unsteadily, walks back to the bar.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           C.U. of EMMA staring at the ceiling. A male figure, half-dressed, 
           collapses on top of her. 

                                 EMMA
                        While I’ve got you here, 4B need more copies of 
                        To Kill A Mockingbird.

           He rolls over - her boss, PHIL GODALMING.

           Fade in CAPTION; 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER.

                                 MR GODALMING
                        I’ll pull some strings 
                                (nuzzling at her neck)
                        God, I’m going to miss this. Six whole weeks 
                        without you. I’ll go crazy.

                                 EMMA
                        Well at least it’ll give the carpet burn a 
                        chance to heal. And there’s always your wife to 
                        fall back on. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           EMMA starts to retrieve her discarded clothes. We’re in the head-
           master’s office after hours; a bottle of warm white wine and two 
           tea mugs, sofa cushions on the floor. 

                                 MR GODALMING
                        Are you angry with me for some reason?

                                 EMMA
                        No, Phil, this is idyllic. I suppose one day I’d 
                        just like to make love on furniture that doesn’t 
                        stack. 

                                 MR GODALMING
                        Hey, don’t be like this. This is our last time 
                        ‘til September. Come here - 
                                (his phone is ringing)
                        Buggeration, it’s Fiona -
                                (fingers on lips)
                        Shhhh. Not a word - 
                                (he answers)
                        Hello darling! No, my meeting overran that’s 
                        all, I’m just finishing up now...

           Hugging her clothes, EMMA sits in the evening sun, melancholy. 

           INT. CORRIDOR, COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL - EVENING

                                 EMMA
                        Phil, before you go, I’ve got to say something -

                                       MR GODALMING
                        Fingers on lips! I got you a present -
                                (from his briefcase - a new mobile 
                                 phone)
                        Top of the range, so we can talk anytime. I 
                        don’t think I’ll be able to hack it otherwise, 
                        not for six whole weeks.
                                (EMMA holds the box, smiles)
                        What’s up? You don’t like it?

                                 EMMA
                        No, I just lost a bet with someone that’s all. 
                        Thank you, it’s very...practical.

                                 MR GODALMING
                        I’d kiss you but the cleaners might see. 

                                 EMMA
                        Is that Keats?

                                 MR GODALMING
                        I love you, Emma Morley. 

                                 EMMA
                        No, you don’t.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 MR GODALMING
                                (wagging his finger)
                        I think I’d know, don’t you? Hm?

           INT. FLAT, HACKNEY - NIGHT

           Carrying bags of groceries, EMMA unlocks the door of her flat and 
           hesitates; noise. She groans and enters; 

           IAN stands in the bedroom, going through drawers; photos and 
           papers scatter the floor. In beard and ancient T-shirt, visibly 
           drunk, he is a mess. 

                                 EMMA
                        Looking good, Ian. 

                                 IAN
                        Get stuffed, Emma.

                                 EMMA
                        Nice comeback. Is that from the act?

                                                        EMMA
                                             I’ve got to warn you now, 
                                             Ian, I’m not in the mood 
                                             for this -
                           IAN
           No, though I do have this 
           new thing I’ve been working 
           on. I come on and I say, 
           here’s a funny story, 
           you’ll like this, there’s 
           this guy, nice enough, 
           going out with this girl, 
           loves her, worships her, 
           they buy a flat together, 
           he gets an engagement ring, 
           the lot - turns out she’s 
           in love with her best 
           friend -

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        That’s not the reason, Ian, as I’ve told you a 
                        hundred -

                                 IAN
                        No? Here’s the punchline -
                                (notebook in hand)
                        How does he find out? He reads her poetry!

           Eyes blazing, EMMA flies at him, grabbing at the notebook-

                                 EMMA
                        You bastard. Give me that! 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                                        EMMA
                           IAN
           Ah, graduation night, the 
           shared bed, that magical 
           week in Greece, all the 
           longing, it’s all here, in 
           black and white.
                                             Have some dignity, will 
                                             you? Learn some self-
                                             respect, because if you 
                                             ever, ever come here and go 
                                             through my things, I swear 
                                             I will call the police...

                                 IAN
                        Fine, call the police! It’s my flat too!

                                 EMMA
                        Is it? I paid the mortgage, you just sat around 
                        farting and watching Wrath of Khan! 

                                 IAN
                        Not true, that is just not true -

                                 EMMA
                        God, I hate this place, I’ve always hated this 
                        place. 

                                 IAN
                        How can you say that? This was our home!

                                 EMMA
                        I wasn’t happy, Ian, couldn’t you see that?

                                 IAN
                        Don’t say these things, please Em...

           Desperate, he tries to embrace her, both of them crying now. EMMA 
           resists, then relents.

                                 IAN (CONT’D)
                        This is hell. Ever since you left me, I’m in 
                        hell, Em. 

                                 EMMA
                        Ian, I’m sorry, but what can I do?

           EMMA can say nothing. She stands, holding on to IAN.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, HACKNEY FLAT - NIGHT

           Some time later, and they lie tangled up on the sofa.

                                 IAN
                        Good job we didn’t get married.
                                (IAN presses his face against her 
                                 hair, taking in the scent)
                        Sorry for going through your stuff. I’ve been a 
                        bit mad, that’s all. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        S’alright. Don’t do it again though.

                                 IAN
                        It’s good, by the way. Not the poems, the poems 
                        are awful, but the other stuff, the stories. 
                        You’re funny, proper funny. Not like me.

                                 EMMA
                        Ian -

                                 IAN
                        All I mean is you should show them to someone. 
                        You’re better than you know.
                                (he sits)
                        I miss you, Em.

                                 EMMA
                        I know you do. 

                                 IAN
                        I feel sick with it. Right here. 
                                (his hand to his chest)
                        Either that or it’s trapped wind.

                                 EMMA
                        Either way, it’ll pass. 

                                 IAN
                        Still, I miss it. Ian and Em, Em and Ian.
                                ( - on EMMA -)
                        Don’t suppose you’re going to change your mind?
                                (EM shakes her head)
                        Righto. No harm in asking. 
                                (he goes to the door)
                        I still think you’re the bollocks, mind. 

           EMMA smiles, and IAN tries to smile too. He turns, opens the 
           door, kicking the bottom so that it appears he has struck his 
           face. Comedy! EMMA smiles dutifully at the gag.

           INT. BEDROOM, HACKNEY FLAT - NIGHT

           And now EMMA is on her knees, cleaning up the devastation of 
           IAN’s rampage through her possessions. 

           Photos. On the terrace in Greece, Em and Dex. EMMA sits, 
           stares, very much alone.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, HACKNEY FLAT - NIGHT

           An empty bottle of wine and the new mobile phone lie on the 
           coffee table, as EMMA struggles to read the instructions, then 
           gives up. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           She starts to channel-hop. Then stops - 

           A late-night, low-budget show - 

           INT. ‘GAME ON’, TV STUDIO, LONDON - NIGHT

           Looking paunchy and a little tired, DEXTER reviews computer 
           games.

                                 DEXTER
                        Hello night-owls, and welcome to Game On, your 
                        chance to find out about the hot new console 
                        games coming your way...

           EM puts the TV on mute. It’s almost as if DEX is talking directly 
           to her. She smiles, picks up the new phone - 

           INT. HALLWAY, EMMA’S FLAT, NORTH LONDON - DAY

           C.U. of the same phone ringing. EMMA glares at it, takes a deep 
           breath, answers.

                                 EMMA
                        I’ve told you, please, please do not call me on 
                        this number.

           CAPTION; 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER

                       EMMA (CONT’D)
           It’s a purely professional 
           relationship, and if you 
           can’t move on...I’m hanging 
           up now, Phil, goodbye! I 
           said goodbye now...
                                                     PHIL (O.S.)
                                             Oh no, Ms Morley, you can’t 
                                             do this, you can’t just 
                                             walk out on us after all 
                                             we’ve been through and 
                                             expect everything to carry 
                                             on as normal -

                                 PHIL (O.S.)
                        Let’s not make this a disciplinary issue -

                                 EMMA
                        I beg your - Oh, forget it. I resign.

                                 PHIL (O.S.)
                        Resign? You can’t resign, Emma. What’ll you 
                        do...?

           She hangs up, heart-beating fast, elated. She looks around her, 
           taking in her surroundings.

           Packing cases. A new flat, a new haircut, new clothes, a new 
           beginning. EMMA sits a moment to take it in.

           Then she tosses the phone into a packing case, and continues 
           to unpack.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           INT. ‘GAME ON’, TV STUDIO, LONDON - DAY

           A break from filming. DEXTER sits with his agent AARON.

                                 AARON
                        The bad news is they’re cancelling the show. 

                                 DEXTER
                        They are? Shit. Shit.

                                 AARON
                        Not cancelling it exactly, it’ll have the same 
                        name, just a different presenter.

                                 DEXTER
                        So it’s the same show -

                                 AARON
                        - with a different presenter. 

                                 DEXTER
                        You mean - they’re sacking me?

                                 AARON
                        They didn’t use the word ‘sack’, they said they 
                        were taking the show in a different direction, a 
                        direction that is away from you. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Right. Okay. Well, what’s the good news?

                                 AARON
                        Sorry?

                                 DEXTER
                        You said that was the bad news, what’s the good 
                        news?

           AARON is silent.

           EXT. ‘GAME ON’, TV STUDIO, LONDON - DAY

           AARON and a down-beat DEXTER step out into the daylight.

                                 AARON
                        Every career has its ups and downs; this is 
                        just a massive, bloody great down. I sense 
                        disenchantment, Dexy.

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m just a little concerned about my future. 
                        It’s not what I expected. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 AARON
                        The future never is. That’s what makes it so 
                        fucking exciting!
                                (the lift’s there)
                        People do love you, Dex, but in an ironic, 
                        love-to-hate kind-of-way. We just need to get 
                        someone to love you for real.

           INT. TV STUDIO, LONDON - DAY

           DEXTER pumps money urgently into a cigarette machine. Nothing 
           happens. He jabs at the buttons. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Not you too, you inanimate bastard -

           The WOMAN at the adjacent vending machine looks over.

                                 WOMAN
                        Perhaps it’s telling you to give up.
                                (offering the packet)
                        Dried apricot?

           She is pale, slim, ethereal, smartly-dressed. From somewhere 
           DEXTER digs up his old smile - 

                                 DEXTER
                        Can I smoke it?
                                (she smiles, barely)
                        I’m Dexter...

                                 WOMAN
                        I know who you are.

                                 DEXTER
                        Well I’m glad someone still does.
                                (chewing dried apricot)
                        This is disgusting, by the way.

                                 SYLVIE
                                (offering her hand)
                        My name’s Sylvie. Sylvie Cope

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           DEXTER is practicing in the mirror.

                                 DEXTER
                        I love you, Sylvie Cope. No, I think I might be 
                        in love with you...

           CAPTION; 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        You know, I’ve never said this to anyone before, 
                        well, not sober, but I think I might be...no, 
                        just ‘I love you’. I love you, Sylvie.

           EXT. GARDEN, COPE FAMILY HOUSE, SUSSEX - NIGHT

           C.U. of SYLVIE, object of DEXTER’s affection. Lit by candlelight 
           in the summer evening, she is austerely beautiful. DEXTER stares, 
           unable to believe his luck. 

           With them are the COPE family - wealthy, handsome, self-
           confident. MUM, DAD and teenage twins MURRAY and SAMUEL.

                                 MRS COPE
                        Sylvie tells me you used to be a TV presenter.

                                 DEXTER
                        Long time ago now.

                                 MURRAY
                        On ‘Largin’ It’, that terrible programme, d’you 
                        remember mummy?

                                 SAMUEL
                        You used to really hate it.

                                 MURRAY
                        Turn it off you, you used to say. Turn it off! 

                                 MRS COPE
                        Oh. That was you, was it?

                                 DEXTER
                        Guilty as charged!

                                 MR COPE
                        And what do you do now, Dexter? Are you still a 
                        presenter?

                                 DEXTER
                        Not so much these days. That sort of...drifted
                        away.

                                 SYLVIE
                        What Dexter really wants to do is direct.

           The TWINS snigger. A sceptical silence.

                                 MRS COPE
                        Party games!
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           INT. LIVING ROOM, COPE FAMILY - NIGHT

           Blind-folded, DEXTER and MURRAY kneel on the carpet, playing ‘Are 
           you there, Moriarty?’, a surprisingly vicious Edwardian parlour 
           game. MURRAY wields a rolled newspaper baton, which he uses to 
           strike out at DEXTER.

                                 MURRAY
                        Are you there, Moriarty?

           DEXTER, blindfolded, attempts to contort out of the way. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Here!

           And MURRAY lands a painful blow to DEXTER’s ear. Laughter and 
           applause from the family.

                                 MURRAY
                        Are you there, Moriarty?

                                 DEXTER
                        Here!

           Once again, a vicious uppercut to DEXTER. More applause -

                                 MURRAY
                        Are you there, Moriarty?

                                 DEXTER
                                (weary now)
                        Here.

           A demeaning slap to the head. Struggling to remain good-tempered, 
           he tugs the blindfold away to see the family laughing merrily at 
           his expense. 

                                 MURRAY
                                (punching the air)
                        Yessssss!

                                 SYLVIE
                        Well I’m still proud of you.

           MURRAY and SAM gleefully make the ‘L’ sign - L for loser..

                                 MR COPE
                        Right, who’s next? 

           JUMP CUT - as the game continues, DEXTER reaches once more for 
           the wine bottle, glowering dangerously, excluded from the family 
           high spirits. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 SYLVIE
                        Dexter?
                                (he puts his wine down)
                        Care to take me on?

           The COPE FAMILY think this is a splendid idea. DEXTER has no 
           choice. As MURRAY ties his blindfold.

                                 DEXTER
                        Are you sure you want to do this? 

                                 SYLVIE
                        Oh, I’m sure. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Ready?

                                 SYLVIE
                        Whenever you -

           And DEXTER suddenly lashes out, a fearsome upper-cut that catches 
           SYLVIE unawares and sends her flying across the room. A terrible 
           gasp of shock and disapproval...

                         MRS COPE
                                                      MR COPE
           Darling, darling are you 
           alright?
                                             What the hell are you 
                                             doing, man!

           SYLVIE struggles to her knees, shaken, nose-bleeding.

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m sorry, I must have caught her at an odd 
                        angle. Sylvie, I am so, so sorry.

                                 MRS COPE 
                        YOU DIDN’T EVEN ASK IF SHE WAS THERE MORIARTY!

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m sorry, I wasn’t thinking, I was...

                                 MURRAY
                        Drunk! You’re drunk, that’s what it is.

           And the accusation hangs heavy in the air.

           INT. SYLVIE’S BEDROOM, COPE HOME - NIGHT

           DEXTER and a red-nosed SYLVIE lie solemnly in bed. 

                                 DEXTER
                        You know, I think they really like me!
                                (SYLVIE scowls)
                        You did say you were ready - 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 SYLVIE
                        I don’t want to talk about it, Dexter - 
                                (a kiss goodnight?)
                        No. I’ll bleed.

           She turns her back to him.

                                 DEXTER
                        Sorry for fucking-up. Again! 

           She snaps the light out but he has something to say - 

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        It’s like they say; you always hurt the one you 
                        love!

           He waits. And waits. Nothing from SYLVIE.

           He sighs, and turns his light out too. 

           A moment as he lies there in the darkness.

           Then DEXTER starts to laugh. 

           Music; THE ARRIVAL OF THE QUEEN OF SHEBA by HANDEL, played on a 
           church organ. Wedding music...

           INT. STATELY HOME, SOMERSET - DAY

           A BRIDE progresses to meet her GROOM, her dress a fantasia of 
           white satin and lace, her face obscured behind a veil. 

           EXT. STATELY HOME, SOMERSET - DAY

           A beaten-up VW screeches diagonally to a halt on a grand 
           gravelled driveway. EMMA, looking wonderful but harassed in a 
           blue silk oriental-style dress, tosses her car-keys to a 
           uniformed VALET.

                                 EMMA
                        The doors don’t lock and there’s no reverse and 
                        no hand-brake. Park it on level ground or up 
                        against a tree. Thank you...

           Music can be heard from the house. EMMA removes her high heels 
           and runs across the lawn. 

           CAPTION; 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER

           INT. STATELY HOME, SOMERSET - DAY

           The BRIDE’s veil is lifted. REVEAL: TILLY, EMMA’s old flat-mate 
           from 1988-91.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           In the congregation, DEXTER and SYLVIE watch hand-in-hand. A 
           commotion at the back of the chapel causes the crowd to turn. 
           EMMA tumbles into her seat - 

                                 EMMA
                        Sorry! Sorry.

           DEXTER sees her and smiles. 

           EXT. STATELY HOME, SOMERSET - DAY

           The guests mingle on the terrace in the afternoon sun, EMMA 
           chatting happily to TILLY the bride. DEXTER watches from a 
           distance. SYLVIE sees him watching.

                                 SYLVIE
                        Another old flame?

                                 DEXTER
                        An old friend. Emma Morley. You met her at Bob’s 
                        wedding, remember? 

                                 SYLVIE
                        Vaguely. They all melt into one after a while. 
                        So did you have a thing with her?

                                 DEXTER
                        No - 

                                 SYLVIE
                        What about the bride?

                                 DEXTER
                        No! What do you think I am?

                                 SYLVIE
                        It’s just every weekend we go to some wedding 
                        with a coach-load of people you’ve slept with. 
                        Like a conference...

                                 DEXTER
                        Hey - you’re the only one for me now. 

           And he slips his arm around her waist, kisses her.

           A little way off, EMMA watches this, then turns her attention 
           back to the bride, a snowdrift of satin and lace.

                                 TILLY
                                (her absurd dress-)
                        You don’t think it’s too much?

                                 EMMA
                        Not at all. It’s...understated elegance.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 TILLY
                        Awww, thank you! You know, when we used to live 
                        together all those years ago, I used to think, 
                        you and me, no-one will ever marry us. AND LOOK 
                        AT ME NOW! LOOK AT MEEEE! WHEEEEEEE!

           And she bustles off. EMMA exhales slowly.

                                 DEXTER
                        Don’t I know you from somewhere?

                                 EMMA
                        Your face rings a bell. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Nice outfit.

                                 EMMA
                                (her oriental dress-)
                        Thank you, I call it my Fall-of-Saigon-look. 
                        Natural silk my eye, I’m soaked, it’s like I’ve 
                        run The Derby. 

                                 DEXTER
                        The hair’s different too. Is that ‘A Rachel’?

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t push your luck, Dexter.

           A brief silence as they grin at each other.

                                 DEXTER
                        Another weekend, another wedding.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m eating so much salmon, twice a year I get 
                        this urge to swim upstream.

           Then a commotion; TILLY is about to hurl her bouquet into the 
           crowd.

                                 TILLY
                        EMMMMAAAAA! CATCH!

           And like a shot-putter, TILLY hurls the bouquet through the air 
           towards her friend.

           It lands on the ground at EMMA’s feet...

           EXT. STATELY HOME, SOMERSET - DAY

           DEXTER is being talked at by CALLUM; bluff, charming, a great 
           deal better-dressed than when we first saw him. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 CALLUM
                        Sandwiches, that’s the future. Crayfish and 
                        rocket wraps, organic smoothies, fair-trade 
                        coffees. I’ve got twelve branches open, twelve 
                        more by the end of the year. 

                                 DEXTER
                        You know there’s a rumour going around that 
                        you’re a multi-millionaire. 

                                 CALLUM
                                (a casual shrug)
                        Define ‘multi’. Hey, you should come and have 
                        lunch. Not that crayfish shit, decent food. 
                        There could be opportunities. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Callum, are you offering me a job?

                                 CALLUM
                        I’m just saying - 

                                 DEXTER
                        I can’t believe you’re offering me a job!

                                 CALLUM
                        I’ve not seen you on TV for a while - 

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m in development! 

                                 CALLUM
                        - and if you felt like a career-change -

                                 DEXTER
                        Callum, at University you wore the same pair of 
                        trousers for three years. 

                                 CALLUM
                        Long time ago now, pal. We’re not students any 
                        more. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Eleven years ago.

                                 CALLUM
                        Is it? Good God, eleven years. 

           A moment, as they take in the old friends from college.

                        Have you seen Emma Morley? 
                                (find EMMA in the crowd, laughing. 
                                 Glowing.)
                        Right under our noses, all that time. Bloody 
                        hell. Who knew? 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           DEXTER watches her. Music up - a cover version of Nothing 
           Compares 2 U.

           INT. STATELY HOME - DAY

           The BRIDE and GROOM snog inappropriately to the wedding band’s 
           song. EMMA watches from the sidelines -

                 - and is watched herself by DEXTER, sitting between CALLUM and 
           SYLVIE. 

                                 CALLUM
                        ...at which point your boyfriend here, wanders 
                        in, 4 in the morning, completely smashed...

           DEXTER makes a decision, gets up, walks towards EM. SYLVIE 
           watches him go. 

           The band strike up - 1999 by Prince. People whoop and rush to the 
           dancefloor, as DEXTER arrives. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Care to dance?

                                 EMMA
                        Um, no.

           They stand at the edge of the dance-floor, watching the arthritic 
           frugging of their contemporaries.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        When did we start dancing like old people? And 
                        what’s with the thumbs?
                                (she demonstrates. DEXTER laughs. As 
                                 ‘1999’ plays-)
                        When I first heard this song I thought it would 
                        all be hover-cars and glass cities and holidays 
                        on the moon. I thought I’d have a jet pack and a 
                        robot dog, and here I am, drinking too much in 
                        painful shoes. Nothing changes. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Some things do.
                                (EMMA looks to him)
                        Shall we go get out of here?

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, yes please.

           EXT. STATELY HOME - DAY

           They’ve taken a bottle of champagne to the steps of the stately 
           home, away from the thump-thump of the party.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        So this book of yours. Am I in it?

                                 EMMA
                        Yes, it’s called ‘Dexter Mayhew, My Triumph.’

                                 DEXTER
                        Nice title. And writing obviously suits you. 

                                 EMMA
                        Thank you, Dexter. You look fine too. Better 
                        than during the rock-and-roll years. What 
                        happened? Sex in toilet cubicles lose its 
                        bittersweet charm?

                                 DEXTER
                                (there’s a bench.)
                        Well If you’re twenty-two you can say, I’m an 
                        idiot but I’m only twenty-two, I’m only twenty-
                        five, only twenty-eight. But only thirty-four?
                                (DEXTER pours champagne)
                        Everyone has a central dilemma in their lives, 
                        and mine was can you be a decent, mature, 
                        successful human-being and still get invited to 
                        threesomes. 

                                 EMMA
                        So what’s the answer, Dex?

                                 DEXTER
                        An orgy won’t keep you warm at night. 

                                 EMMA
                        An orgy won’t look after you when you’re old. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I wasn’t getting invited to orgies anyway - or 
                        not many.
                                (she laughs - then sombre)
                        Screwed up my career, screwed up with mum -

                                 EMMA
                        Well that’s not true - 

                                 DEXTER
                        - screwed up my friendships.
                                (beat)
                        Then I met Sylvie, and she saved me really. 

           At the marquee, SYLVIE has stepped out and is speaking earnestly 
           with CALLUM. They watch.

                                 EMMA
                        She’s very beautiful -

                                 DEXTER
                        - a little scary sometimes. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        She’s got a lovely, warm sort of Leni
                        Riefenstahl quality to her. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Of course she has absolutely no sense of humour.

                                 EMMA
                        A sense of humour’s over-rated; goofing around 
                        all the time, like Ian. The only time Ian ever 
                        really made me laugh was when he fell down the 
                        stairs. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Sylvie says she never laughs because she doesn’t 
                        like what it does to her face.

                                 EMMA
                        Ow.
                                (They both laugh.)
                        But you love her, right? 

                                 DEXTER
                        I worship her. 

                                 EMMA
                        Worship! Well that’s even better. True love 
                        found you in the end. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Something like that. 

           A beat. In the silence, the wedding band strikes up ‘It’s Raining 
           Men’. 

                                 EMMA
                        Apparently it’s about to start raining men. Want 
                        to go back?

                                 DEXTER
                        Not yet
                                (stands, offers his hand)
                        Someone said there’s a maze.

           EXT. MAZE, STATELY HOME - DAY

           They wander down the green corridors

                                 DEXTER
                        So what about you? Any romance?

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t start, Dex.

                                 DEXTER
                        What? 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        Sympathy. I’m not lonely, I’m alone. There. How 
                        did that sound?

                                 DEXTER
                        I bought it.

                                 EMMA
                        Because it’s true. I’ve got a tiny advance to 
                        write this book and I swim and go for walks and 
                        read. And I’ve had my adventures too. Nothing 
                        like your eat-as-much-as-you-can buffet, but one 
                        or two, or three. Besides, if I ever get 
                        desperate there’s always your offer. 

                                 DEXTER
                        What offer?

                                 EMMA
                        You once said if I was still single at forty, 
                        you’d marry me, remember? 

                                 DEXTER
                        Did I say that? 

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t worry, still six years to go...

           But DEXTER has stopped walking.

                                 DEXTER
                        There’s a problem.

           She turns, and there’s a moment of realisation between them 
           before she throws her arms around him.

                                 EMMA
                        You’re getting married! That’s amazing, 
                        congratulations, Dex. 

                                 DEXTER
                                (an envelope)
                        I wanted to give you this in person.

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter, that is amazing stationary.

                                 DEXTER
                        Eight quid each. 

                                 EMMA
                        That’s more than my car. Scented -
                                (sniffing the envelope)
                        Your wedding invitations are scented!

                                 EMMA
                        No, Dex - money. It smells of money. 
                                (she reads the invite)
                        August 14th. That’s...four weeks away.

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s what they call a shotgun wedding. For 350. 
                        With buffet.

                                 EMMA
                                (and she gets it)
                        Dexter, I turn my back for one minute!
                                (hugging him again)
                        Do you know the father? I’m kidding! 
                        Congratulations, Dex. God, aren’t you meant to 
                        space these bombshells out a bit? A dad. Is that 
                        allowed? Will they let you?

                                 DEXTER
                        Incredible isn’t it? Bloody hell, sit back and 
                        watch me fuck that one up. 

                                 EMMA
                        You’ll be a wonderful dad.

                                 DEXTER
                        You think so?

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t doubt it for a second. And Sylvie’s 
                        pleased?

                                 DEXTER
                        She’s worried it’ll make her look fat, but we 
                        want to get on with it, we don’t want to end up 
                        mid-thirties, all alone, no kids - 

                                 EMMA
                        Like me!

                                 DEXTER
                        Exactly, like you. That’s not what I meant.

                                 EMMA
                        I know. But you’re happy, yeah?

                                 DEXTER
                        Happier. Happyish

                                 EMMA
                        Happyish. Well that’s all we can hope for.

           They’re embracing now. A moment, a look, then a vibration in 
           DEXTER’s chest makes them leap apart.

           And as he goes to take the call, we stay on EMMA; the agony of

                                (on phone)
                        Sorry, love, it’s like a maze in here!...No, 
                        it’s a joke...well, because I am literally in 
                        a...forget it...only Emma. Okay, we’ll find our 
                        way out now...you know Callum, talk to 
                        Callum...alright, see you soon. Love you...
                                (he hangs up)
                        Did I sound drunk?
                                (sees EMMA’s face)
                        Hey, what’s up?

                                 EMMA
                        Too much champagne. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Tell me - 

           They embrace again -

                                 EMMA
                        I missed you, Dex -

                                 DEXTER
                        I missed you too. 

                                 EMMA
                        Thought about you every day, I mean every day -

                                 DEXTER
                        Me too.

                                 EMMA
                        Let’s never, never do that again.

                                 DEXTER
                        We won’t.

           They kiss, just for a moment -

           Then break away. 

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        Em...

                                 EMMA
                        Dex?

                                 DEXTER
                        We should go. 

                                 EMMA
                        Absolutely.

                        Let’s go and find this fiancée of yours. I want 
                        to congratulate her...

           The sound of a baby crying -

           INT. NURSERY, TERRACED HOUSE, RICHMOND - NIGHT

           In the dawn light, DEXTER stands in a half-decorated nursery, 
           desperately jiggling his seven-month old daughter JASMINE, small 
           but with an incredible capacity to cry -

           CAPTION: 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER

           INT. TRAIN, LONDON - DAWN

           Grey-faced with exhaustion, DEXTER strap-hangs, surrounded by 
           commuters on the early morning train. He wears a beige shirt and 
           tie, the uniform of -  

           INT. NATURAL STUFF CAFE - DAY

           A busy branch of the organic sandwich chain. DEXTER, the manager 
           serves a CUSTOMER -

                                 DEXTER
                        So that’s a carrot juice, a latte with an extra 
                        shot, the lentil soup - bread with the soup?

           TWO CUSTOMERS are looking at him, giggling; recognition.

           INT. STORE-ROOM, NATURAL STUFF CAFE - DAY

           DEXTER is checking in a delivery from a LORRY DRIVER.

                                 LORRY DRIVER
                                (with a clipboard)
                        And if I can just get your autograph?

                                 DEXTER
                        Sure, who do you want it made out to?

           But the DRIVER frowns, hands him the delivery note to sign. 
           DEXTER does so.

           Exhausted, DEXTER rests his head against the wall, closes his 
           eyes, sighs. A voice behind him - 

                                 CALLUM
                        Everything alright, mate?

           DEX jerks upright, smiles at CALLUM his boss. Then back to work -

           INT. LIVING ROOM, TERRACED HOUSE, RICHMOND - NIGHT

           The married home is pleasant, suburban, but in the throes of 
           cataclysmic building work. Dust sheets cover the furniture, 
           plaster dust hangs in the air.

                                 SYLVIE
                        There’s plenty of formula, I’ve pureed the 
                        veggies, or you can mash some banana.

           An exhausted DEXTER is jiggling the baby, following SYLVIE as she 
           gets ready for her hen-night. 

                                 DEXTER
                        What about Indian food? I can give her curry, 
                        right? And chips? 

                                 SYLVIE
                        Dexter, no!

                                 DEXTER
                        Sylvie, I’m joking. 

                                 SYLVIE
                        Oh. Well I do wish you wouldn’t, I’m late as it 
                        is. I don’t even know why I’m going, I’m too old 
                        for hen nights.
                                (the sound of a horn)
                        My taxi. I’ll be back tomorrow morning. Be good, 
                        don’t burn the place down. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m not a child, Sylvie -

           - he goes to kiss her, but she pulls away.

                                 SYLVIE
                        Lipstick! 
                                (then kissing the baby)
                        Goodbye my angel.

           The slam of the door provokes another wailing from JASMINE.

                                 DEXTER
                        Give me a break will you?

           INT. LIVING ROOM, TERRACED HOUSE, RICHMOND - NIGHT

           Wailing becomes whimpering as DEXTER bounces the baby and channel-
           hops at the same time. 

           A face flashes on to the screen. SUKI MEADOWS, presenting a 
           lavish Saturday night entertainment show - 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 SUKI ON TV
                        WAAAAAHAAAAAAAY!

           He snaps the TV off, sighs, heads for -

           INT. JASMINE’S BEDROOM, TERRACED HOUSE - NIGHT

           ‘Mozart for Babies’ plays as DEXTER performs a desperate stuffed-
           toy cabaret for his grizzling daughter. 

                                 DEXTER
                        What’s that, Teddy? Mr Froggy is shattered? Mr 
                        Froggy wants to go to sleep! Aw, goodnight
                        Froggy, goodnight!
                                (JASMINE just cries more)
                        I’m doing my best here. Am I freaking you out? 
                        Am I being weird? Just tell me what you want! 
                        Just...learn to talk!

           INT. LIVING ROOM, TERRACED HOUSE, RICHMOND - NIGHT

                                 DEXTER
                                (over JASMINE’s cries)
                        - I’ll pay for your taxi, anything Em, just come 
                        over will you? I’m going spare here, Emma. Call 
                        me!

           He hangs up - more crying. What now? 

           INT. NURSERY, TERRACED HOUSE, RICHMOND - NIGHT

           Music blares; BACK TO LIFE by SOUL 2 SOUL. DEXTER dances with his 
           daughter, a sort of insane soft toy disco. JASMINE is at least 
           smiling now, but still no nearer to sleep.  

           INT. NURSERY, TERRACED HOUSE, RICHMOND - NIGHT

           DEXTER and JASMINE lie exhausted amidst the devastation. The 
           phone rings. Bleary-eyed, he reaches for it -

                                 DEXTER
                        Emma? Thank god...

                                 SYLVIE (O.S.)
                        It’s me.

                                 DEXTER
                                (cursing himself)
                        Sorry, Emma said she might - how’s the party?

                                 SYLVIE (O.S.)
                        Drunk, messy. We’re meant to be going on to some 
                        club now. How is she?

                                 DEXTER 
                        Asleep, finally. 

                                 SYLVIE (O.S.)
                        She’s been awake all this time?

                                 DEXTER
                        My fault, I should’ve given her the decaf.
                                (a noise from SYLVIE)
                        My God, I made you laugh.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, LONDON - DAY

           SYLVIE sits on the bed in a lush hotel room, smiling, but 
           emotional, with tears in her eyes.

                                 SYLVIE
                        And are you alright? I was worried.

                                 DEXTER (O.S.)
                        Fine, good, yes. Why were you worried?

                                 SYLVIE
                        No reason, just...checking in. But if 
                        everything’s fine...Goodnight then.

                                 DEXTER (O.S.)
                        Sylvie?

           INT. NURSERY, TERRACE HOUSE, RICHMOND - NIGHT

           Taking in the chaos -

                                 DEXTER
                        I know I’m not being very good at this, the 
                        whole dad-husband thing. But I’m working on it 
                        and I will get better, I promise you. And I do 
                        love you...

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, LONDON - NIGHT

                                 DEXTER (O.S.)
                        Very much. That’s all. 

           A figure enters from the bathroom, wet from the shower -

           - Dexter’s friend, CALLUM. He kisses SYLVIE’s neck.

                                 SYLVIE
                        I’ve got to go. See you in the morning. 

           Sombre, a little tearful, SYLVIE hangs up the phone.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, TERRACE HOUSE, RICHMOND - NIGHT

           JASMINE sleeps on DEXTER’s chest. With great devotion, he kisses 
           his daughter’s head tenderly and closes his eyes -

           INT. EUROSTAR TRAIN, GARE DU NORD, PARIS  - DAY

                 - then opens them again. In C.U., dark shadows under his eyes, 
           stubble on his chin; a mess. The train slows down.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Veuillez s'assurer que vous avez toutes vos

           On the table, a hardback novel; on the cover, a scratchy cartoon 
           of a teenage girl beneath a scrawled title; 

           Julie Criscoll Versus The Whole Wide World by EMMA MORLEY.

           A sticker proclaims ‘The Sunday Times Bestseller!’. DEXTER opens 
           the book to its last page. On the flyleaf, a black and white 
           photo of EMMA, laughing.

           CAPTION; 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER.

           EXT. GARE DU NORD, PARIS - DAY

           And there she is, at the arrivals gate, with the limo drivers and 
           waiting partners. Hair cut, in new shirt and pencil skirt; happy, 
           healthy, confident, as in her photo. 

           She peers into the advancing crowd, sees DEXTER, taking in his 
           dishevelled appearance, then holds up a cardboard sign ‘Monsieur 
           Dexter Mayhew’, a limo driver looking for her client.

           And then they’re embracing. 

                                 EMMA
                        Funny?

                                 DEXTER
                        Quite funny.

                                 EMMA
                        Bonjour, bonjour!

                                 DEXTER
                        You didn’t have to meet me.

                                 EMMA
                        Of course I had to meet you.

                                 DEXTER
                                (her new look)
                        You even look like a writer. A writer in Paris. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’ve been trying to grow a little goatee. What 
                        do you look like?

                                 DEXTER
                        Fucked-up divorcee?
                                (a moment)
                        So d’you want me to get back on the train?

                                 EMMA
                        No. Not yet.

                        My apartment’s not far. Shall we walk?

           EXT. CANAL ST. MARTIN, PARIS - DAY

           They walk arm in arm along the canal.

                                 DEXTER
                        How did it happen, Em? Eighteen months ago I had 
                        a family, a people-carrier, nice little house 
                        with sensible furniture and stripped floorboards 
                        -

                                 EMMA
                        - all of which you hated -

                                 DEXTER
                        But it was mine. And now everything’s gone. My 
                        life’s effectively over. 

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter -

                                 DEXTER
                        I know, it’s just...when I first lived here, 
                        everything seemed possible. Now, years later, 
                        nothing does.
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter, you can do anything you want. You can go 
                        back to presenting, or photography, you used to 
                        talk about photography all the time, or 
                        something new. The internet!
                                (DEXTER groans)
                        You’ve got a third-class degree in anthropology. 
                        People will always need anthropologists.
                                (she takes his hand)
                        You’re a healthy, capable, moderately attractive 
                        single father in your mid-late-thirties. You’re 
                        gold dust.

                                 DEXTER
                        Gold-dust.

                                 EMMA
                        You just need your confidence back, that’s all.

           And they sit by the canal, EMMA’s head on his shoulder. 

           EXT. BOULEVARD DE BELLEVILLE, PARIS - DAY

           They walk arm-in-arm through the chaos and bustle of the 20th 
           arrondissement. EMMA stops outside a door. 

                                 EMMA
                        So this is it, the writer’s garret. Don’t expect 
                        too much, will you?

           INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BELLEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           EMMA opens the door on a pleasant, unpretentious apartment, book-
           lined, light and airy. 

                                 EMMA
                        Chez moi! Put your bags anywhere.

           She crosses to the fridge, gets a bottle of water and takes a 
           long drink, turning to find that DEXTER is suddenly kissing her. 
           Confusion. She takes a moment to step back and swallow. 

                          DEXTER
                                                        EMMA
           Sorry about that -
                                             You took me by surprise, 
                                             that’s all -

                          DEXTER
           Okay now?
                                                        EMMA
                                             - but Dexter, I have to 
                                             tell you -

           - and he’s kissing her again. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                                        EMMA
                                             - Dexter, I’ve met 
                          DEXTER
           I’ve wanted to do that ever 
           since -
                                             someone. 

                                 DEXTER
                        What? 

                                 EMMA
                        I’ve met someone. 

                                 DEXTER
                        You’ve met someone? Already?

                                 EMMA
                        Yes!

                                 DEXTER
                        A man?

                                 EMMA
                        Yes, a man, a guy. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Oh, a guy. Right, okay. So, so...

                                 EMMA
                        He’s called Jean-Pierre, Jean-Pierre Dusollier. 

                                 DEXTER
                        He’s French?

                                 EMMA
                        No, Dex, he’s Welsh.

                                 DEXTER
                        But you’ve only been here six weeks! 

                                 EMMA
                        Two months! I met him three weeks ago.

                                 DEXTER
                        Where, how?

                                 EMMA
                        A little bistro near here.

                                 DEXTER
                        A little bistro -

                                 EMMA
                        We got talking -

                                 DEXTER
                        What, in French?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        Yes, in French!

                                 DEXTER
                        So what’s he like then, this - 

                                 EMMA
                        Jean-Pierre? He’s great. Handsome, charming, 
                        just very, very..French! 

                                 DEXTER
                        What, you mean rude?

                                 EMMA
                        No -

                                 DEXTER
                        Arrogant? Wears a string of onions -

                                 EMMA
                        Why are you being like this?

                          DEXTER
           Sexy, is that what it 
           means? You’re having lot of 
           sex?
                                                        EMMA
                                             Why are you being so mean? 
                                             I’ve done nothing wrong, 
                                             just met someone -

                                 DEXTER
                        But we slept together!

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter, we got a little drunk -

                                 DEXTER
                        Not that drunk - 

                                 EMMA
                        You took your trousers off over your shoes, Dex.
                                (conciliatory)
                        Okay, you want to talk about what happened, come 
                        here. 

           With a sigh, he crosses to the sofa. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I think you were upset about Sylvie and you got 
                        a little drunk, a little lonely, and you just 
                        needed a shoulder to cry on. Or sleep with. And 
                        that’s what I was; a shoulder to sleep with. 

                                 DEXTER
                        And that’s why you did it? To cheer me up?

                                 EMMA
                        Well, it worked didn’t it?
                                (her head on his shoulder)

                                      EMMA (CONT'D)
                        If you must know it was one of the better nights 
                        of my life, but we’ve known each other a long 
                        time, Dex -

                                 DEXTER
                        So you don’t think it’s a good idea? Dex and Em, 
                        Em and Dex, the two of us, just for a while, see 
                        how it goes? Because I thought that’s what you 
                        wanted too.

                                 EMMA
                        I do...I did! In the late Eighties. 

                                 DEXTER
                        And you like him, this guy?

                                 EMMA
                        I do, I really like him.

                                 DEXTER
                        My timing isn’t great, is it?

                                 EMMA
                        No, not brilliant.
                                (head on his shoulder)
                        Dex, why didn’t you say all this years ago?

                                 DEXTER
                        Too busy having fun I suppose. 

                                 EMMA
                                (riled)
                        And now you’ve stopped having fun you think 
                        ‘good old Em, give her a call, settle down -’

                                 DEXTER
                        That’s not what I meant - 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not going to be the consolation prize, Dex. 
                        I think I’m worth a bit more than that. 

                                 DEXTER
                        That’s what I’ve been telling you for years! Of 
                        all the people I’ve ever known, you’re the one I 
                        want to talk to. Doesn’t matter where I am, or 
                        who I’m with, you’re always going to be the best 
                        person in the room. You’re extraordinary. It 
                        just took me ‘til now to realise it, that’s all.

           A long moment. Then EMMA stands suddenly. 

                                 EMMA
                        Right, well that’s enough of that. We’d better 
                        get going. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Why, what are we doing?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                                (in the bathroom)
                        Jean-Pierre wants to meet you! 

                                 DEXTER
                        You’re kidding! 

                                 EMMA
                        We’re going to hear him play. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Play? Play what?

                                 EMMA
                        He’s a jazz pianist!
                                (DEXTER rolls his eyes)
                        We’re going to have a drink then hear him play 
                        free jazz for about nine hours and it’s going to 
                        be lots of fun and in NO WAY AWKWARD!

           She slams the door. DEXTER buries his head in his hands - 

           INT. BATHROOM, PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

           Heart beating fast, EMMA stands with her back to the door. 

           INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BELLEVILLE - DAY

           DEXTER lies on the sofa, deep in thought. The bathroom door 
           opens. EMMA stands there in her summer dress. Whether or not he 
           says it aloud, DEXTER’s thought is clearly ‘wow’.

                                 EMMA
                        Do me up. 

           She turns, and offers her back to him. DEXTER fastens the zip to 
           her neck. They stand a moment.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe we should change the subject.

           EXT. BISTRO, PARIS - DAY

           They walk through a beautiful Paris evening. 

                                 DEXTER
                        So what are you writing now?

                                 EMMA
                        A sequel. Julie goes on this school trip to 
                        Paris and falls for this French boy. Hilarious. 
                        I’m a franchise now apparently, and everyone 
                        loves a franchise.

                        I mean I’d like to write a serious, grown-up 
                        book one day, something epic and beautiful, 
                        without pictures. But maybe that’s what happens; 
                        you start out wanting to change the world and 
                        end up thinking it’s enough to tell a few good 
                        jokes. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I brought a copy for you to sign.

                        What d’you want me to sign it for?

                                 DEXTER
                        You’re famous now. And rich.

                                 EMMA
                        Hardly.

                                 DEXTER
                        You will be soon. An author, a successful 
                        author. I’m proud of you. 

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter? Shut-up.

           They’ve reached a cool little bar on a pretty square. JEAN-PIERRE 
           sits at an outside table. Startlingly handsome, every inch the 
           jazz-pianist, he sips a glass of wine and reads a novel. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        That is Jean-Pierre.

                                 DEXTER
                        Couldn’t you at least find someone good-looking?
                                (She smiles. )
                        Em, I’m sure he’s a fine jazz pianist, but I 
                        can’t do this. You go, I’ll see a movie, go back 
                        to the apartment, get some sleep. Call me in the 
                        morning. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh. Okay. I’m sorry, Dex.

                                 DEXTER
                        What for?

           A smile, and then she walks towards the cafe. 

           For a moment, DEXTER watches as JEAN-PIERRE throws his arms 
           around her. She starts to speak, reaching for a French-English 
           dictionary in her bag - 

           But DEXTER has seen enough. He walks away.

           And in wide shot, we see that behind him EMMA is leaving the 
           restaurant, running after him...

                                 EMMA
                        Dex, hold on! Wait! 

                                 DEXTER
                        Em, you have a nice time, I’ll be fine -

                                 EMMA
                        I told him I’ve got tonsillitis.

                                 DEXTER
                        Tonsillitis?

                                 EMMA
                        ‘Je suis tres desole mais mes glandes, je pense
                        que je peux avoir l’amygdalite -’

                                 DEXTER
                        L’amy -

                                 EMMA
                        L’amygdalite. I looked it up. 

           And then she laughs, takes hold of his face and kisses him. The 
           kiss continues for some time. Then, very stern - 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        If you muck me about, Dex - 

                                 DEXTER
                        - I swear, I will never, ever - 

                                 EMMA
                        - lead me on or let me down or go behind my 
                        back, I will murder you. I will eat your beating 
                        heart. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I won’t do that - 

                                 EMMA
                        You swear? 

                                 DEXTER
                        I swear.

           Another kiss. Then she looks at him. 

                                 EMMA
                        I thought I’d got rid of you. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I don’t think you can. 

           They kiss again...
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           ...in bed now, EMMA with her eyes closed, a tentative morning 
           kiss.

                                 DEXTER
                        So I’ve been thinking.

                                 EMMA
                        Leave me alone. I’m asleep.  

                                 DEXTER
                        I think you should sell your flat. Move in with 
                        me.

           CAPTION: 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter, are you asking me to be your flatmate?

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Okay. I’ll think about it. 

           EXT. STREET, NORTH LONDON - DAY

           EMMA pushes her bike, DEXTER walks alongside. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I sort of assumed you’d just say yes.

                                 EMMA
                        We more or less live together as it is. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I just don’t see the point of pretending we 
                        don’t want to be together when we do.  

                                 EMMA
                                (taking this in)
                        But your place is such a bachelor pad. Every 
                        time I open a cupboard I expect to be buried 
                        under this deluge of panties -

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s not like that - 

                                 EMMA
                        - and what if we need more space in the future, 
                        more rooms?

                                 DEXTER
                        Why?
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA
                        Dex, you know why.

           They’ve stopped outside a shuttered shop front, DEX a little 
           awkward now, suddenly keen to change the subject.

                                 DEXTER
                        I’ve got to go. 

                                 EMMA
                        That was close. We nearly talked about it. 

                                 DEXTER
                                (a kiss-)
                        We will. Tonight. 

           Still a little on edge, EMMA heads off on her bike. 

           DEXTER unlocks the metal shutter, lifts it up with a clatter. A 
           sign on the wall; ‘Cafe de Belleville’.

           INT. CAFE DE BELLEVILLE, LONDON - DAY

           DEX’s new business is a Paris-themed cafe/delicatessen. Or at 
           least it will be. At present, refurbishment is taking place, and 
           DEXTER joins the BUILDERS and DECORATORS - 

                                 SYLVIE
                        So - all on schedule?

           She stands with JASMINE, now two-and-a-half, pretty but rather 
           serious, carrying a small suitcase. DEXTER scoops her up, kisses 
           her. SYLVIE smiles stiffly.

                                 SYLVIE (CONT’D)
                        Very impressive. Whose idea was all this then?

                                 DEXTER
                        Emma. 

                                 SYLVIE
                        Good old Emma. 
                                (not bitter - regretful)
                        You look well, Dexter. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I am well.

           A silence - not tense, but self-conscious.

                                 SYLVIE
                        See you both Sunday.

           A smile, a kiss on JASMINE’s head, then SYLVIE’s gone. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           MUSIC. Upbeat, loud - 

           EXT. CAFE DE BELLEVILLE, LONDON - EVENING

           Evening now, but EMMA, JASMINE and DEXTER continue to work, 
           painting by candlelight. 

           EMMA and JASMINE have painted a large, goggle-eyed face in 
           undercoat on the bare wall - mad teeth, cross-eyed.

                                 DEXTER
                        Who’s that meant to be?

                                 JASMINE
                        It’s you -

                                 EMMA
                        - obviously.

                                 DEXTER
                        Very funny, now paint over it.

                                 EMMA
                        No! We like it.

           DEXTER watches them, taking in EMMA’s easy familiarity with 
           his daughter.

           INT. SPARE BEDROOM, DEXTER’S FLAT - NIGHT

           EMMA reads The Gruffalo to JASMINE. DEXTER watches from the 
           doorway.

                                 DEXTER
                        Want me to take over?

                                 JASMINE
                        Emma does the voices better. 

           Forcing a smile, redundant, DEXTER leaves. 

           INT. DEXTER’S BEDROOM, FLAT - NIGHT

           DEXTER and EMMA in bed as before, faces almost touching. 

                                 DEXTER
                        But I’m just so bad at it, Em -

                                 EMMA
                        No you’re not -
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        I am! I don’t know how to talk to her, I make a 
                        joke, she rolls her eyes at me; she’s two-and-a 
                        half! I didn’t expect her to roll her eyes until 
                        she was at least twelve -
                                (EMMA laughs)
                        I thought little girls were meant to adore their 
                        dads?

                                 EMMA
                        She does adore you, you know it. But this isn’t 
                        about Jasmine.
                                (A deep breath)
                        I’m really happy, Dexter. I never expected to 
                        be, but I am. I love my work, I love London, and 
                        you. I’ve got everything I ever wanted -

                                 DEXTER
                        - so why change things? -

                                 EMMA
                        - except this; I want a child with the man I 
                        love. And if he won’t do it, then I want one 
                        with you.

           Faces almost touching, they kiss. From next door, JASMINE starts 
           to shout -

                                 JASMINE (O.S.)
                        Emma! Emmmm-ma!

                                 DEXTER
                        Technically she’s calling for you.

           EMMA closes her eyes. DEXTER sighs, kisses her, then goes.

                                 DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking...Oh
                        God. Start again. I’d like to thank everyone 
                        for coming today...

           REVEAL; DEXTER is practicing his groom’s speech, unaware that 
           EMMA sits on the stairs behind him, listening in.

                                (realises she’s listening)
                        You’re not meant to hear this.

                                 EMMA
                        Carry on. I love it. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Can’t you write it for me?

                                 EMMA
                        Maybe you could just use your last one.
                                (holding out her hand)
                        It’s three in the morning. Come to bed.

                                 DEXTER
                                (crosses to her)
                        You promise you won’t make me have sex again?

                                 EMMA
                        I’m sorry, I can’t promise that.

           And they kiss -

           - then crash into the mundanity of another working day. The 
           burble of the radio as EMMA and DEXTER stand at the sink, 
           brushing their teeth, both a little bad-tempered.

                                 DEXTER
                                (examining his face)
                        I’m getting old. 

                                 EMMA
                        You’re not getting old. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I’ve got hair inside my ears. What’s the point 
                        of that? And I’m getting fat. Look at me, I’m a 
                        mess. 

                                 EMMA
                        So eat less. Do some exercise. Come swimming 
                        with me later. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Can’t, I’ve got to work -

                                 EMMA
                        Fine, don’t then. Get fat -  

           EMMA stalks out, bad-tempered. A parting shot -

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        By the way, in case you’re interested, I’m not 
                        pregnant.

           And she’s gone. On DEXTER, concerned. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM, EMMA AND DEXTER’S FLAT - DAY

           The same old flat, cluttered now with EMMA’s stuff. DEXTER 
           follows her -

                                 DEXTER
                        How d’you know?

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter, how d’you think?

                                 DEXTER
                        Oh well.
                                (he takes her hand)
                        We’ll try again, yeah?

           But she tugs her hand away and stalks off. 

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        Em, I’m sorry, but please don’t take it out on -

                                 EMMA
                        Are you sorry?

                                 DEXTER
                        Of course I am! I want this as much as you do -

                                 EMMA
                        Because you never used to want it -  

                                 DEXTER
                        Well, I do now -

                                 EMMA
                        You always look relieved - 

                                 DEXTER
                        You know I don’t! Hey, come here - 

                                 EMMA
                        No. I’ve got to go - 

                                 DEXTER
                        Em -

                                 EMMA
                        No!

           He crosses, holds on to her. She relents, softens. 
                           One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        I’m sorry, Em. 

                                 EMMA
                        No, I’m sorry, for taking it out on you.

                                 DEXTER
                        Okay, so after work, we’ll meet on Primrose 
                        Hill, go to the movies, your choice, something 
                        with subtitles and no violence, then go have 
                        dinner somewhere, you and me, Em and Dex -

                                 EMMA
                        - Dex and Em -

                                 DEXTER
                        And we will work this out, I swear.

           And they stay there, holding each other tight. 

           INT. EMMA’S OFFICE, EMMA AND DEXTER’S FLAT - DAY

           EMMA sits at her desk, surrounded by papers, books, photographs, 
           copies of her novels in various languages. 

           She sits and stares, unable to concentrate. Suddenly she stands - 

           EXT. SWIMMING POND, HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY

           The open-air swimming pond on the Heath. EMMA dives into the 
           water, attempting to swim away some of her anxiety. 

           Pensive, she floats in the water, looking up at the canopy of 
           branches. An overcast day, clouds rolling in.

           EXT. SWIMMING POND, HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY

           Leaving the pool now, she heads for her bicycle. A summer shower 
           is on the way. She speaks on her phone -

                                 EMMA
                        Hey there, just to say I’m running late but I’m 
                        on my way. And I’m sorry for being so snappy 
                        this morning...

           EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY

           EMMA cycles across the glorious Heath, free-wheeling, in a hurry.
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           EXT. STREETS, NORTH LONDON - DAY

           Head-down against the rain, EMMA cycles towards her appointment 
           along residential streets. 

           There’s a sudden blur of movement to one side as a van approaches 
           from a side street without stopping.

           EMMA is struck full-on, hurled from her bike to the other side of 
           the street. The squeal of brakes, screams.

           She comes to rest in the road, lying on her back, uncomprehending 
           of what has just happened. Distressed PASSERS-BY stand over her, 
           but EMMA hears no voices, just the sound of her own breathing. 
           She tries to sit, and falls back, gasping. 

           EMMA looks to the sky in confusion. Rain falls on her face.  She 
           blinks once, twice. 

           Then EMMA MORLEY dies.

           EXT. PRIMROSE HILL, LONDON - DAY

           DEXTER waits at the usual rendezvous, sheltering beneath a tree. 
           He checks his watch, then his phone. EMMA’s message - 

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Hey there, just to say I’m running late but 
                        I’m on my way. And I’m sorry for being so 
                        snappy this morning. I wanted to say...you’re
                        a fine thing Dexter Mayhew. I love you very 
                        much. There you go. Lucky you! Bye. 

           DEXTER smiles, raises his collar against the summer rain. 

           He waits. 

           A whisper, low, insistent -

                                 EMMA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hey you. Wake up. Waaaake-up...

           INT. EMMA’S BEDROOM, EDINBURGH 1988 - DAY

           And we’re back where we started. A student bedroom; albums, 
           posters, photos, discarded clothes. Crammed into the single bed 
           are EMMA, 22, and DEXTER, 23, opening his eyes with a start, 
           trying to take in his surroundings.

                                 EMMA
                        S’alright, don’t panic. It’s only me. You stuck 
                        your tongue in my ear. This ear. Ring any bells? 
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        Oh, hi there -

                                 EMMA
                                (shaking his hand)
                        - Emma, Emma Morley. 

                                 DEXTER
                        First class honours with distinction.

                                 EMMA
                        That’s me. So - what do you suggest we do? 

                                 DEXTER
                        Ummm - keep in touch?

                                 EMMA
                        I mean today. We’re meant to be doing something 
                        today.

                                 DEXTER
                        Today? Well it’s a little tricky -

                                 EMMA
                        Ah -

                                 DEXTER
                        I’ve had lovely time, fantastic, really, but 
                        it’s just I’m meant to be meeting my parents 
                        later.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh. You’d better go then.
                                (she closes her eyes, turns over)
                        Nice to meet you. Bye now.

           DEX reconsiders. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Not until later though. I mean, if you wanted 
                        to, I don’t know, go for a little walk or 
                        something?

           On EMMA, secretly smiling.

           EXT. ARTHUR’S SEAT, EDINBURGH 1988 - DAY

           The eastern end of Edinburgh is dominated by Arthur’s Seat, a 
           startling piece of Highland scenery that rises above the city. 

           Wearing his suit from the night before, smoking a cigarette, 
           DEXTER pants and stumbles his way up the mountain while EMMA 
           strides out in front. 

                                 EMMA
                        I can’t believe you’ve never done this. 
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        I’ve been busy. 

                                 EMMA
                        What, studying?
                                (DEXTER’s doubled-over, gasping)
                        You might find it easier if you took the 
                        cigarette out of your mouth. 

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s these shoes. I can’t mountain-climb in 
                        brogues.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s not a mountain, it’s a hill, just a big 
                        hill. A child could do it. 

                                 DEXTER
                        So can we go back down now?

                                 EMMA
                        No! We have to see the view. 

                                 DEXTER
                        View’s are over-rated. 

                                 EMMA
                        Dexter Mayhew. You’re so dark and complex.  

           And they stop and turn. The view - 360 degrees, taking in 
           Edinburgh, the Firth of Forth, the North Sea - is indeed 
           spectacular on this spectacular July day. Despite himself, DEXTER 
           has to smile.

           Music up; dance music, loud, aggressive...

           INT. NIGHTCLUB, LONDON  - NIGHT

           C.U. On DEXTER, the same smile, but now DEXTER’s eyes are  
           tightly closed, his head thrown back; a man completely lost.

           A glass in his hand, he’s dancing, stumbling round the dance 
           floor, indifferent to the crowd around him, who regard him 
           warily; a drunk, a clown.  CAPTION: 15TH JULY, SEVENTEEN YEARS 
           LATER

           INT. NIGHTCLUB, LONDON - NIGHT

           Soaked with sweat and booze, he stumbles towards a pretty GIRL at 
           the bar. 

                                 DEXTER
                        What’s your name?
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 GIRL
                        Go away. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Aw, don’t be like that. Have a drink with me. 
                        It’s my anniversary -

                                 GIRL
                        I said go away. You’re drunk -

                                 DEXTER
                        First anniversary? One year ago on this very day 
                        -
                                (tugging her arm, desperate)
                        Hey, come on, talk to me! Don’t be like that, 
                        talk to me!

           And now the BOYFRIEND is back, shoving DEXTER into a table of 
           drinks. Glass everywhere, screams -

           INT. DEXTER’S FLAT, BELSIZE PARK - DAY

           A child’s face, close-up, staring, confused.

           This is JASMINE MAYHEW, now five and a half years-old. She 
           stares, uncomprehending, at a figure slumped on the carpet. 

           DEXTER lies, beaten, bruised and filthy, clothes torn, on the 
           floor. He opens swollen eyes, sees his daughter and, still drunk, 
           smiles in recognition for a moment before his face buckles; shame 
           and self-loathing. 

           And now SYLVIE is there, struggling to get him into a sitting 
           position.

                                 SYLVIE
                        Jasmine, please, go next door will you? Daddy’s 
                        not very well. Next door, now!

                                 DEXTER
                        Oh Sylvie, I fucked-up again -

                                 SYLVIE
                        Sit, Dexter, come on, help me out...
                                (JASMINE is still there)
                        Jasmine! Next door, now!

           DEXTER collapses, curls into a ball, closes his eyes. 

                                                                 FADE TO BLACK:

           INT. CAR - DAY

           DEXTER opens his eyes. He’s in a car. A square of the brightest 
           blue sky is visible through the window. He closes his eyes again -
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           INT. DEXTER’S BEDROOM, MAYHEW HOUSE, OXFORDSHIRE - DAY

           - and opens them to find himself in his childhood bedroom; 
           photographs and posters on the wall, evening sun on his face. 
           Voices come from the front drive -

                                 STEVEN (O.S.)
                        He’ll be fine, I’ll let him sleep it off...

           Sitting, DEXTER’s bemused to find himself in his father’s old 
           pyjamas.

                                 SYLVIE (O.S.)
                        And you’re sure you don’t mind? I’d take him 
                        myself, but with Callum -

                                 STEVEN (O.S.)
                        No, you did the right thing, I’ll look after 
                        him...

           He crosses to the window - in the driveway, SYLVIE is about to 
           leave.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY, MAYHEW HOUSE - DAY 

           DEXTER walks sheepishly outside.

                                 STEVEN
                        Ah, talk of the devil...

           And discreetly, he leaves DEXTER alone with SYLVIE.

                                 DEXTER
                        I am so, so sorry.

                                 SYLVIE
                        It’s fine, just don’t ever do it again. How are 
                        you feeling?

                                 DEXTER
                        There’s blood in my mouth and I don’t know why. 

           JASMINE is watching from the car window. DEXTER rises his 
           hand. Warily, she raises hers back. 

                                 SYLVIE
                        I told her you had food poisoning. Though that 
                        doesn’t really explain this -

           She touches his puffy, bruised face. DEXTER winces.

                                 DEXTER
                        World’s Greatest Dad.
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 SYLVIE
                        Well you could be. But that’s up to you.

                                 DEXTER
                        I’ll make it up to her. And you. I keep saying 
                        that, don’t I? For years now.

                                 SYLVIE
                                (smiles, takes his hand)
                        We do all love you, Dexter. 

                                 DEXTER
                        No reason why you should.

                                 SYLVIE
                        No, maybe not. And yet we do.

           And she smiles, turns and heads to her car. His FATHER is at his 
           elbow now.

                                 STEVEN
                        I’ve burnt the soup.

                                 DEXTER
                        Can you burn soup?

                                 STEVEN
                        Apparently so. 

                                 DEXTER
                                (the pyjamas)
                        Who put me in these?

                                 STEVEN
                        I was in the Merchant Navy, Dexter. You’ve got 
                        nothing I’ve not seen before. 

           He goes. DEXTER winces, then follows his father back inside.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MAYHEW HOUSE - NIGHT

           DEXTER and STEVEN, two widowers in pyjamas, eat soup in front of 
           the TV in companionable silence. Eventually -

                                 STEVEN
                        So is this going to be an annual festival, d’you 
                        think? Every 15th July?

                                 DEXTER
                        I hope not. 

                                 STEVEN
                        I don’t want a heart-to-heart, do you?

                                 DEXTER
                        I’d rather not. 
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 STEVEN
                        Except to say that I think the best thing you 
                        can do is to live your life as if Emma’s still 
                        here. Don’t you?

                                 DEXTER
                        I don’t think I can, dad.

                                 STEVEN
                        ‘Course you can.
                                (he turns back to the TV)
                        What d’you think I’ve been doing for the last 
                        ten years?

           They continue to watch TV.

           INT. CAFE DE BELLEVILLE, NORTH LONDON - DAY

           The business is bustling now, and DEXTER stands at the counter, 
           working through accounts. A voice behind him.

                                 VOICE
                        Excuse me, waiter, but there’s a fly in my soup.

           IAN WHITEHEAD - older, happier, plumper but no better dressed. 
           DEXTER gives him a slightly self-conscious embrace.

           CAPTION: 15TH JULY, ONE YEAR LATER.

           INT. CAFE DE BELLEVILLE, NORTH LONDON

                                 DEXTER
                        How’s the stand-up comedy?

                                 IAN
                        I gave that up. Get booed as much as I did and 
                        you start to think maybe they’ve got a point. 

                                 DEXTER
                        That’s a shame. 

                                 IAN
                        Not really, I was never any good. The only time 
                        I ever really made Emma laugh was when I fell 
                        down the stairs.
                                (DEXTER laughs)
                        I’m in insurance now, insurance sales.

                                 DEXTER
                        Well that’s great -

                                 IAN
                                (funny voice -)
                        - he said as he stifled a yawn. 
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        What I mean is I’m glad life worked out.

                                 IAN
                        Yeah. Me too. Seeing anyone?

                                 DEXTER
                        Not yet.

                                 IAN
                        Well you should. She’d expect it. She’d bloody 
                        hate it, but she’d want it too. 
                                (awkward pause)
                        I hate today, don’t you? This date, 15th July. I 
                        always will hate it. I used to really hate you 
                        too. I mean quite violently. I used to read Em’s 
                        diaries and overhear her phone calls and watch 
                        you together, and she used to just...light up 
                        with you like she never did with me, and I used 
                        to get so angry. she was always going to be the 
                        best, the smartest, brightest, kindest person we 
                        knew and I didn’t think you deserved her. Can I 
                        say this?

                                 DEXTER
                        Go on. 

                                 IAN
                        You were a shit - excuse my French - and then 
                        you grew up a bit and you weren’t a shit
                        anymore. She made you decent and in return you 
                        made her very, very happy. She...glowed with it. 
                        I’ll always be grateful to you for that.
                                (DEXTER can’t speak. In a funny 
                                 voice-)
                        And on that note, this is for you - 

           He produces a large brown envelope, hands it over -

                                 DEXTER
                        Are you sure you don’t want to -

                                 IAN
                        I shouldn’t have had it in the first place. 
                        It’s yours now. So -  

           IAN’s family sit at a nearby table; WIFE and two KIDS, all eating 
           ice-creams

                                 IAN (CONT’D)
                        Back to the sticks. Look at ‘em - 
                                (the KIDS have ice-cream smeared 
                                 round their faces)
                        - greedy little sods. How much do I - ?

                                 DEXTER
                        On the house, I insist.
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 IAN
                        How’s your little one?

                                 DEXTER
                        She’s a beauty.

                                 IAN
                        Well you should cherish her then. 
                                (- the envelope -)
                        Look after that.

                                 DEXTER
                        And I’ll give you a call...

                                 IAN
                        Oh, that’s not necessary. I think we’re done 
                        here, don’t you?
                                (A big hug)
                        Good luck, mate. Seize the day, all that 
                        bollocks. 

           And then he’s gone, bustling his children out of the cafe. 

           DEXTER takes a moment, then opens the envelope - 

           Glimpses of letters, photos, post-cards. He glances through them. 
           Some images we recognise - the trip to Greece for instance - 
           others we don’t. DEXTER sees a photo, smiles and pulls it out for 
           a closer look.

           The photo shows DEX and EM on the peak of Arthur’s Seat on this 
           very day in 1988, standing together a little awkwardly. 

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Come on then, smile. Big smile. That’s not a 
                        smile...

           DEXTER smiles at the memory.

                                 EMMA  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        There. That’s better.

           The whirr of a self-timer... 

           EXT. ARTHUR’S SEAT, EDINBURGH - DAY

           The camera is balanced on a rock. The shutter clicks. 

                                 EMMA
                        For when you’re famous! ‘See that man there? He 
                        touched me up at a party once’ 

           She retrieves the camera and settles next to him. There are a 
           number of graduates dotted around the place, some hungover, some 
           still wearing their graduation gowns. 
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           EM and DEX look out at Edinburgh spread before them.  

                                 DEXTER
                        Beautiful day. 

                                 EMMA
                        If on St. Swithin’s Day it doth rain/dum-di-
                        dum-di-dum again.
                                (DEXTER laughs)
                        Dexter, I don’t want you thinking that I’m 
                        bothered or anything, about last night. I 
                        know it was only ‘cause you were drunk - 

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s not that -

                                 EMMA
                        Let me finish, will you? I’ve not done a lot of 
                        that kind of thing, I’ve not made a study of it, 
                        not like you, but it was nice, even if we just 
                        ‘cuddled’. I think you’re nice too, when you 
                        want to be. And now you should head off to India 
                        or Thailand or wherever it is, and find 
                        yourself, and I’ll write my daft plays. I don’t 
                        want your phone number or letters or postcards, 
                        I don’t want to get married to you or have your 
                        babies, or even to have another fling. We had 
                        one really, really nice day together. I’ll 
                        always remember it, and if we bump into each 
                        other sometime in the future, that’s fine too. 
                        We’ll be...friends. Agreed?

                                 DEXTER
                        Fine by me. 

           And they sit next to each other, facing the view, shoulders 
           touching. 

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        On the other hand - 

                                 EMMA
                        Go on. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Well, my parents aren’t picking me up until this 
                        evening. The flat’s empty. If you wanted 
                        to...finish what we started. 

                                 EMMA
                        What, sober?

                                 DEXTER
                        And in daylight.

           EMMA ponders this, makes her decision -

                                 EMMA
                        Race you.

           Then whooping, laughing, she starts to tumble down the hillside, 
           with DEXTER following on...

           As they do so, two figures can be seen on the horizon, a MAN and 
           a seven year-old GIRL. A closer look - 

           DEXTER and JASMINE. 15th July 2007. JASMINE strides on ahead as 
           her father struggles behind her. 

                                 JASMINE
                        D’you want a piggy-back, old man?

                                 DEXTER
                        It’s these shoes. I’ve got no grip on these 
                        shoes. 

           And laughing, she bounds on ahead. 

           EXT. ARTHUR’S SEAT, EDINBURGH - DAY

           Once again, a number of GRADUATES stand around, hungover, posing 
           in gowns and caps. DEXTER and JASMINE take in the view. 

                                 DEXTER
                        That’s the Firth of Forth, flowing out to the 
                        North Sea. That’s the New Town, where I used to 
                        live. Is this boring?

                                 JASMINE
                        Not completely. 

                                 DEXTER
                        And down there, that’s Emma’s old flat. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Did you come up here with Emma?

                                 DEXTER
                        I did, once. Long time ago now.

           They lie back, basking in the sun. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Do you miss her? 

                                 DEXTER
                        Of course. She was my best friend. Why, do you?

                                 JASMINE
                        I was only small, I don’t remember her that 
                        well. I remember the wedding. She was nice. So 
                        who’s your best friend now?
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        You of course. Why, who’s yours?

                                 JASMINE
                                (thinks hard)
                        I think it’s probably mum. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Ha. 
                                (his arm around her)
                        Not such a terrible dad though, am I?

                                 JASMINE
                        I’m not answering that.  

                                 DEXTER
                        Why not?

                                 JASMINE
                        Because you want me to be soppy, and I’m not 
                        going to.
                                (stuffing ipod headphones into her 
                                 ears)
                        You know what you are. 

           - and, for the first time, DEXTER does.

           JASMINE lies next to her father, her head on his shoulder. DEXTER 
           regards her fondly. 

                                 DEXTER
                        God, I love you. You have no idea.

                                 JASMINE
                                (removing her headphones)
                        Hm?

                                 DEXTER
                        I said it’s a beautiful day.

           They both close their eyes against the sun. 

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        No sign of rain. 

           EXT. EDINBURGH STREETS, NEW TOWN - DAY

           EMMA and DEXTER hurl along the streets, hand-in-hand in the late 
           afternoon, giggling, laughing with excitement as they turn into a 
           terrace of elegant Georgian town houses. 

                                 EMMA
                        Which number?

                                 DEXTER
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 EMMA

                                 EMMA/DEXTER

           And then a voice sails across the street. 

                                 ALISON
                        Dexter! Dexter, over here!

           His parents wave from their parked car. DEX and EM slam into 
           disappointment like running into a wall.

                                 DEXTER
                        Damn. They’re early.
                                (He drops EM’s hand. To his parents -
                                 )
                        You’re early!

                                 ALISON
                        We thought we’d surprise you.

                                 DEXTER
                        You did, you have. Mum, dad - this is my friend 
                        Emma...

                                 EMMA
                        ...Morley. Pleased to meet you.

                                 ALISON
                        Emma, you’ll join us for tea, yes?

           DEXTER’s eyes blaze an apology. EMMA considers.

                                 EMMA
                        No. No thanks. I’ll leave you to it. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Really? You’re going?

                                 EMMA
                        Pleasure to meet you all - 
                                (shaking DEXTER’s hand)
                        And, well - have a nice life!

           She turns and goes, DEXTER struggling to hide his disappointment.

                                 ALISON
                        I’m sorry, did we just interrupt something?

                                 DEXTER
                        Not at all. Emma’s just a...good friend. 

                                 ALISON
                                (taking in his suit)
                        Weren’t you wearing this yesterday?
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

           He watches as EMMA turns the corner and disappears. 

           EXT. EDINBURGH STREETS, NEW TOWN - DAY

           EMMA MORLEY walks home slowly, frustrated, maddened by the way 
           things have turned out. Wincing at the memory -

                                 EMMA
                        ‘Have a nice life’?

           It’s a warm summer evening, and the town’s streets are busy with 
           people heading home from work. She climbs the hill towards the 
           great grey granite bulk of Edinburgh Castle. 

           And then she hears it - footsteps on the street, someone running. 
           Without turning round, she knows who it will be. She hears her 
           name and starts to smile, to laugh...

                                 DEXTER
                        Em! Em, wait, will you?

           She adjusts her face from delight to aloof indifference.

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        I’m so, so sorry about that.

                                 EMMA
                        S’alright. Some other time maybe. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Too vague. I need your phone number. 

                                 EMMA
                        Phone number? Right, of course - 
                                (taking his pen)
                        This is me in Edinburgh, this is my parents’ 
                        number and their address, just in case. Dad’s 
                        got a fax machine at work, if you -

                                 DEXTER
                        Just phone is fine.
                                (writing too)
                        This is me. Call me. Or I’ll call you. What I 
                        mean is, it’s not a competition, you don’t lose 
                        if you phone first.

           They swap numbers.

                                 EMMA
                        So. Was that everything?

           And then, as if on cue, they are kissing, standing on the 
           crowded street on this ordinary day in mid-July in 1988.

           The kiss continues, then just as quickly stops. As they step 
           away from each other. 
                          One Day (8th April) by David Nicholls

                                 DEXTER
                        I’ve got to go. 

                                 EMMA
                        I know. 

                                 DEXTER
                        But I’ll see you again. 

                                 EMMA
                        I hope so. 

                                 DEXTER
                        No, you will. 

                                 EMMA
                        I know that I will. 

                                 DEXTER
                        Well. Goodbye, Em.

                                 EMMA
                        Goodbye, Dex.

                                 DEXTER
                        Goodbye. 

                                 EMMA
                        Goodbye. Goodbye. 

                                                                     FADE OUT.

           THE END.
