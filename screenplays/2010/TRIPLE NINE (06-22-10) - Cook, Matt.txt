           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

           Chris Allen (mid-late 20s) lies in bed sound asleep, lost 
           somewhere in a dream.  He lies perfectly still except for 
           his hand resting next to his head on the pillow; the 
           index finger jerking, as if it were pulling a trigger.    

           Chris’s beautiful wife, MICHELLE ALLEN (white, mid-late 
           20s) lies next to him, tenderly watching him sleep.  
           After a moment, she gently takes hold of his finger, 
           gradually waking him with her touch.

           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, BASEMENT - SAME

           Chris sweats through some push-ups, sit-ups, and other 
           calisthenics.  

           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, BATHROOM - SAME

           Chris wipes away the steam from the mirror and shaves his 
           handsome face.

           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME

           Chris loads a large gym bag with all of his equipment:  
           vest, jacket, etc.  He inspects his standard issue 45mm 
           Glock to ensure it’s clear.  

           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - SAME

           Michelle sits at the table feeding their two year old son 
           TREVOR and their one year old daughter, TABITHA. 

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I’ve gotta run, honey.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You’re gonna be great.  Just be 
                        yourself.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Oh God.  Anything but that.

           He laughs as she grabs him by the shirt, pulling him down 
           to her lips.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You’re a fucking stud.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        And you’ve got a dirty mouth.

           She smiles at the connotation and picks up an LAPD mug 
           from the table and hands it to him.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Love you.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Love you too.  Good luck.

           Chris raises the mug to his lips as he leaves.

           INT. UPS DELIVERY TRUCK - DAY

           RUSSELL WELCH (white, 30s) lowers an LAPD mug from his 
           lips and rests it into a cup holder next to the driver’s 
           seat.  He wears a UPS uniform, a shaggy beard, unkempt 
           hair, and drives the truck with care.    

           Laughter echoes from the back of the truck garnering 
           Welch’s attention.  He checks his watch.

                                 WELCH
                        Ten minutes.

           MICHAEL LAIRD (white, 40s), GABRIEL MARTIN (white, mid-
           late 20s), TERRELL TOMPKINS (black, early-mid 30s), and 
           JORGE RODRIGUEZ (Hispanic, early-mid 30s) sit in the back 
           of the truck.  LAPD badges swing on chains around the 
           necks of Tompkins and Rodriguez.

           The walls of the truck are lined with LAPD surveillance 
           gear including monitors, radios, cameras, laptops, and 
           other gadgetry.  Voices sounding off police dispatches 
           and situation reports flow through the speakers.

           In a small cage in the corner of the truck sit AK-47 
           assault rifles and short-barreled PGS-12 shotguns.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Let’s hear it.  We got time.

           Gabriel glances at Michael who nods his approval.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        So, about two years ago when 
                        Rodriguez and I were still U.C., 
                        we’d been running surveillance on 
                        this tranny, tweak dealer hiding 
                        out in a duplex in Long Beach.

           Rodriguez recognizes the story, laughs, and turns red.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        What was his name?

                                 GABRIEL
                        You mean HER name?

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Whichever motherfucker.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        She called herself The Duchess.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Was she attractive?  Because some 
                        of them are really good looking.

           They all stare at Gabriel to see if he’s seriously asking 
           before they break into laughter.  

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        You white boys love that he-she 
                        love, don’t you?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Four days go by and there’s no 
                        sign of The Duchess and no one’s 
                        stopped over to buy any gear or 
                        move any product.  She hasn’t come 
                        out of the duplex for a thing.  

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        And the windows are boarded so we 
                        can’t look in.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        So we start thinking she’s OD’d or 
                        slit her wrist and get a search 
                        warrant to raid the place.  I’m 
                        first through the door and the 
                        smell hits me like a freight 
                        train.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Was she dead?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        She’d been cooking up meth and 
                        there’s about a hundred car 
                        deodorizers hanging from 
                        everything and the air’s so thick 
                        we can hardly breathe.

                        I call out ‘LAPD’ and The Duchess 
                        comes flying out of her room naked 
                        as the day she was born with the 
                        biggest hard-on you’ve ever seen, 
                        and her body, it’s fucking 
                        glowing.  She comes speeding down 
                        the hallway and I dodge her and 
                        she runs right into Rod.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        The second I touch her I realize 
                        she’s covered head to toe with 
                        lube.  She’s squirming like crazy 
                        trying to get away and is just 
                        beating the holy hell out of me.  

                                 WELCH (O.S.)
                        Seven minutes out.

           Michael drags a duffel bag full of clothing and unmarked 
           raid vests into the middle and passes out the gear. 

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        I’m getting KY all over me and her 
                        circus show meat faucet keeps 
                        stabbing me in the legs.  It was 
                        fucking disgusting.  Finally, I 
                        just stick my ass out and hug her 
                        until back-up manages to slide 
                        some cuffs on.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        After we finally clear the house 
                        we come to find she’s gone through 
                        an entire bottle of Viagra and has 
                        this whole online chat set up, 
                        camera, screen, and all.  And 
                        there’s a little mustached Mexican 
                        faggot on the computer screen, 
                        crying at us to ‘bring The Duchess 
                        back’!

                                 (to Rodriguez)
                        It was your brother wasn’t it?

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Do I look Mexican, you dumb Mick?  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        We don’t get paid enough to deal 
                        with that kind of shit.

                        Maybe you should find a new line 
                        of work.

                                 GABRIEL
                        What happened to The Duchess?

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Judge gave her twenty years at San 
                        Quentin.  General pop is death row 
                        for someone like her.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        She got shanked a week after she 
                        arrived.  We sent her straight to 
                        hell.

                                 MICHAEL
                        She’s probably happier there.

                        We’re three out.

           EXT. SUN VALLEY, LOS ANGELES, STREET - SAME

           The truck exits Interstate 5 and eases into the sparse 
           neighborhood traffic.

           INT. UPS DELIVERY TRUCK - SAME

           Michael, Gabriel, Tompkins, and Rodriguez throw on black 
           sweaters, operator gloves, and gear up with the raid 
           vests and tinted glasses.  Tompkins and Rodriguez tuck 
           their badges under their sweaters.

           The light mood has been replaced by determined purpose.

           Michael straps a Nextel radio to his vest and adjusts a 
           small ear-piece.  He conducts a quick radio check with 
           Welch and they all slide on black balaclavas.  They are 
           covered head to toe with no visible sign of skin.

           EXT. SUN VALLEY, LOS ANGELES, STREET - SAME

           The truck turns down a street and stops at a red light.

           INT. UPS DELIVERY TRUCK - SAME

           Michael kneels into the driver’s compartment.  Welch 
           hands him a D-ring with several keys attached.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        One minute.

           Michael steps back into the surveillance compartment.  
           Rodriguez passes out weapons, ammo, and flash-bang 
           grenades.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Thirty seconds.  

           Michael secures the flash-bangs to his vest and throws a 
           large backpack over his shoulders.

           EXT. SUN VALLEY, LOS ANGELES, STREET - SAME

           The truck cruises through two more lights and stops 
           directly in front of a large, one story building.  
           Michael, Gabriel, Tompkins, and Rodriguez step through 
           the driver’s compartment and exit the truck single file.  
           Welch pulls the truck away as quickly as it stopped.

           INT. BUILDING - SAME

           Note* - Unless specified otherwise, all dialogue spoken 
           in the scene by Michael, Gabriel, Tompkins, and Rodriguez 
           will be in Spanish.

           Michael, Gabriel, Tompkins, and Rodriguez approach the 
           glass doors as the truck drives away.

           A large sign inside the building reads SUN STATE BANK AND 
           TRUST.  The bank is large and open, with small cubicles 
           running the length of a wall opposite the teller station. 
           Between them sit a dozen desks and plush leather couches.  
           The tellers work at their station encased behind a tall, 
           reinforced glass wall with a heavy metal door.

           The bank is occupied by eight to ten EMPLOYEES working in 
           various locations, three or four CUSTOMERS, and one 
           SECURITY GUARD just inside the lobby, chatting with the 
           bank manager, WALTER SIMS.  

           The group enters the building and Michael immediately 
           takes down the security guard with a series of violent 
           blows, removing his pistol, mace, and radio.  Gabriel 
           opens Michael’s backpack, removes a pair of cuffs, and 
           arranges them over the guard’s wrists.  

           Screams from the employees and customers slowly build as 
           Tompkins and Rodriguez move methodically through the 
           bank.  Tompkins herds everyone from the lobby and 
           cubicles towards the tellers’ desk.  Rodriguez orders the 
           thick metal door locking the tellers inside to be opened.
           INT. UPS DELIVERY TRUCK - SAME

           *Welch will speak in English to Michael via Nextel.

           Welch backs the truck into an alley two blocks up the 
           street just enough to maintain direct line of sight on 
           the bank.  He reaches next to his seat and pulls from a 
           laptop bag a Mobile Data Terminal(MDT).  He flips it open 
           and the screen lights up with a map of Los Angeles and 
           flashing icons, indicating locations of patrolling units.  

           He is calm and mechanical and listens attentively to the 
           speakers.  The chatter is interrupted by a long beep, 
           then a voice.   

                                 RADIO (O.S.)

                        Sheldon and Glenoaks?

                        Silent alarm’s been triggered and 
                        the call is in.  You’re clear of 
                        stragglers.

           behind the teller’s desk in order to consolidate them.

           Michael jumps from the security guard, towards Sims.

           Michael grabs Sims and pushes him violently up against 
           the wall by his neck.  Gabriel retrieves a wire bike lock 
           from Michael’s back-pack and throws it to Rodriguez.

           wire lock around the handle on the teller door and 
           support beam on the desk, locking them behind the glass.

           Michael kicks the feet out from under Sims and drags him 
           to the wall of the vault.  He grabs his keys and motions 
           for him to stay put.  

                                 MICHAEL

           Gabriel pulls a large, folded bag from Michael’s 
           backpack.  He moves quickly, stuffing all the loose cash 
           around the vault into it.

           Michael finds a key from the manager’s ring and an 
           identical key from his own and walks towards a wall of 
           safety deposit boxes.  He finds box number 212 and uses 
           the two keys to unlock it.  He removes it from the wall 
           and places it into his backpack.  

           He hands the backpack and the keys to Gabriel who exits

           Sims shakes on the floor, staring back in utter fear.

                                 (to Welch)
                        Good.  Get out of here, now.  

           Michael motions to Sims to close his eyes.  He picks up 
           the bag of cash and drops the manager’s keys in front of 
           Sims.  He exits the vault, shutting it closed behind him.  

           He moves into the lobby, racing by the tellers’ desk.

           from the tellers’ desk and the two sprint towards the 
           exit.

           Welch watches Tompkins and Rodriguez exit the bank doors

           Michael pulls two flash-bang grenades from his vest.  The 
           cries grow louder as the employees and customers watch 
           him pull the pins and set them onto the teller’s desk in 
           front of the glass.  They push and shove one another to 
           get as far away from the inevitable blast as possible.

           Michael exits the bank as the grenades go off, exploding 
           into a flash of intense light and sound.  The concussion 
           turns the protective glass into a spider web of cracks, 
           but does not shatter it.

           moment they pull away their balaclavas and glasses and 
           wipe the sweat from the their brows as adrenaline pumps 
           through their veins.

           Rodriguez reaches over the seat, squeezes Michael’s 
           shoulder, and laughs.

           Gabriel parks the Taurus next to a Lexus, truck, and SUV.  
           He opens the trunk of the Lexus and the crew throw all of 
           their weapons, clothes, and gear into it; everything 
           except Michael’s backpack and the bag of money.

           Tompkins shakes his head and jumps into his truck.  
           Rodriguez laughs and walks towards his SUV.  Gabriel and 
           Michael wait until they pull away and set the Taurus 
           ablaze before they drive off in the Lexus.

           BEN FELDMAN (40s) and YUSSEL SHABOT (40s) stand in fine 
           tailored suits watching large cranes load containers onto 
           barges on the dock.  

           Gabriel and Michael arrive and Shabot points to an open 
           container just beyond them.  They park inside and exit 
           the car with their bags.  Shabot locks the container and 
           seals it with shipping wire.  He motions to a forklift 
           driver nearby who picks the conex up and carries it away.

           The four gather around the back of a white Chevy Tahoe.  
           Michael puts the backpack into the SUV.

           INT. SUN STATE BANK AND TRUST - DAY

           JEFFERY ALLEN (white, mid-late 50s) enters the bank.  He 
           looks as though he suffers from a perpetual hangover, but 
           his eyes are sharp when they need to be and his fervency 
           and experience give him a strong presence.  

           Yellow tape surrounds the lobby and markers identify 
           potential evidence.  Half a dozen UNIFORMED OFFICERS 
           speak to witnesses as a few SUITED DETECTIVES snap 
           pictures and take notes of the crime scene.  They are 
           THOMAS LANIER (white, 30s), COREY PAYTON (black, 40s), 
           and TRINA LING (Asian, late 30s).  They converge on 
           Jeffery as soon as he arrives.

           Jeffery holds up his hands signaling for them to stop 
           before they bombard him with information.  They quietly 
           huddle around him and watch as he moves to the center of 
           the lobby and studies the scene and gains his focus:  the 
           badly bruised security guard, the distressed witnesses, 
           the cracked tellers’ glass, the empty flash-bang 
           canisters, and the lock on the teller door.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Walk with me.

           The group follows closely behind, offering noted details 
           of the crime.  They approach the tellers’ desk.

                                 LING
                        It was a four man team.  They 
                        entered the bank at ten after 
                        eight.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN

                        Eight o’clock.  They were covered 
                        head to toe and stormed in heavily 
                        armed with AK-47s and shotties.

                        Where’d they come from?

                                 LING
                        None of the witnesses saw them 
                        arrive.

                        And none of the surrounding stores 
                        were open yet, so we haven’t had 
                        any luck finding a witness outside 
                        of the bank.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Of course not.  This city doesn’t 
                        wake up until nine o’clock.

           Jeffery points to the flash-bang canisters on the floor 
           as he walks behind the desk with Lanier.

                        for riot control.  The concussion 
                        split the glass.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Are they traceable?

                                 LANIER
                        They removed the serial numbers.  
                        Plus, these things can be 
                        purchased online or fifty places 
                        in Los Angeles alone.

           Jeffery stares at the splintered glass and holds up his 
           middle finger.  Payton and Ling stand on the other side, 
           their figures barely recognizable.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Ling.  How many fingers am I 
                        holding up?  

                                 LING
                        Three?

           Jeffery smirks as they move from behind the desk and 
           enter the vault.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        So no one saw them come in and I’m 
                        guessing no one saw how they left.

           Inside the vault Walter Sims sits on a chair shaking, 
           speaking quietly with a violent crimes counselor, BETTY 
           HERNANDEZ (Hispanic, 40s).

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m Sergeant Detective, Jeffery 
                        Allen.  I’m in charge of this 
                        investigation.  You spoke to one 
                        of the men who held you up?  

           Sims nods.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        In English or Spanish?

                                 SIMS
                        English.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        What did he say?

                                 SIMS
                        He knew everything about me.  My 
                        name, my wife and kids’ names.  
                        Their ages.  Where I live.    

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Was there anything about him you 
                        recognized?  His voice?  Anything?

                                 SIMS
                        I’ve already told your partners 
                        everything I know.  What if they 
                        come to my house?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        That’s highly doubtful, but we’ll 
                        get some cruisers over there to 
                        keep an eye out.  

           Jeffery leans into Sims a few inches from his face.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Right now you’ve got some scared 
                        employees who need to see their 
                        boss with his shit together.  Now 
                        you can act like a poor victim or 
                        you buck up and take control of 
                        this situation.

           Sims’s lips begin to quiver.

                        Can you do that for them?

           Sims’s eyes fill with tears as he slides back down into 
           the chair.  Betty eyes Jeffery maliciously and wraps her 
           arms around Sims.  Jeffery gazes at them indifferently 
           and looks around the vault.

                                 PAYTON
                        They made off with a little over 
                        six-hundred thousand from the 
                        vault, but their focus was on that 
                        security deposit box.  Number 212.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Who does it belong to?

                                 PAYTON
                        We’re looking into that right now.

           Jeffery leads the group back into the lobby.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Cameras?

                                 LING
                        The cameras outside don’t extend 
                        to the street.  Our guys come in 
                        and out at the edge of the 
                        sidewalk.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        How long, total?

                                 LANIER
                        They were here two minutes and 
                        forty seconds.

                                 LING
                        Whoever they are, they were 
                        informed and well rehearsed.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        You have a talent for stating the 
                        obvious, Ling.  I need you to 
                        consolidate all the witness 
                        statements.  I want a report on my 
                        desk by COB.  

           Ling frowns at him, unhappy with his condescending tone.

                        Pretty please?  

           She nods agitatedly and walks stiffly away.

                        witness who actually saw 
                        something.

                                 PAYTON
                        I’ll do my best.

           Payton nods and casually walks off.  Jeffery turns to 
           Lanier who awaits instructions.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Search through every armed robbery 
                        in the last three years for crews 
                        matching the MO. Check out the 
                        Mexican cartels and syndicates but 
                        don’t focus on them.  Think scores 
                        with matching weapons, planning, 
                        resources...anything relevant.  
                        Check with our informants and put 
                        it out to the fences.  They’ve 
                        gotta wash that cash somewhere.  
                        And find out who that deposit box 
                        belonged to.  

           Jeffery watches Betty escorting Sims through the lobby.  
           Sims briefly makes eye contact with Jeffery, but looks 
           away shamefully.  Betty mimes the word ‘asshole.’ 

           EXT. LAPD STATION AND MOTOR POOL - DAY

           Chris pulls into the station and parks his GMC in an open 
           spot in the garage.  He grabs his bag and heads for the 
           stairs.

           Welch, dressed now in plain clothes, pulls the UPS truck 
           into the station.  Once through the gate he stops, 
           allowing Chris to cross the road as he heads towards the 
           offices.  

           Welch parks the truck amongst two dozen other 
           surveillance vehicles marked with different logos.  He 
           jumps from the truck and heads into his building.

           INT. LAPD STATION,  GED SQUAD HQ - DAY

           SGT. MICAH NELSON (black, 40s) sits in front of the room 
           speaking to a large group of OFFICERS from the GED (Gang 
           Enforcement Detail).  They’re a potpourri of races and 
           sizes and are dressed in various phases of their 
           uniforms:  black BDU’s, T-shirts stamped LAPD - Gang 
           Enforcement, and raid vests.

           CONTINUED:

           The mood of the shift briefing is light.  Tompkins leans 
           against the wall staring out the window, drinking coffee.  
           Chris Allen sits in the very back of the room listening 
           attentively.  Nelson holds the shift report in his hand.

                                 NELSON
                        Paper work’s getting sloppy 
                        people.  Captain is still waiting 
                        for a report on new gang 
                        initiation methods from some of 
                        you...Smith!  

           SMITH (white, 40s) sits in the middle of the group 
           sipping on a large energy drink.  

                                 SMITH
                        They get in a circle.  They beat 
                        the shit out of each other.  They 
                        hug it out.  The end.

                                 NELSON
                        Get it done.

           Nelson waves the shift report into the air.

                                 NELSON (CONT’D)
                        There’s a lot of updates on the 
                        duty reports to thumb through 
                        before you get moving.  Also, make 
                        sure you go over the station 
                        entries, particularly robbery.  A 
                        bank in Sun Valley just got held 
                        up this morning.

           Tompkins immediately turns his focus to Nelson.

                                 NELSON (CONT’D)
                        Apparently they were heavily armed 
                        and spoke Spanish.

           Half of the officers in the room laugh, including a large 
           Hispanic officer, GOMEZ (Latino, 30s).   

                                 GOMEZ
                        That narrows it down to seventy-
                        five percent of LA County.

                                 NELSON
                        And they all live in your one 
                        bedroom duplex so they shouldn’t 
                        be hard to find.  Smartass.

           Nelson smiles and laughs with the other officers.

                        Anyway, it sounds like they’re too 
                        sophisticated to be street, but 
                        check with your people anyway.  
                        Jeffery Allen from SCU is heading 
                        up the investigation.  And 
                        speaking of Detective Allen, allow 
                        me to introduce the new member of 
                        our squad, his nephew, Chris 
                        Allen.

           Chris stands up and waves to the room.  

                                 NELSON (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you come to us from, 
                        again?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Patrol.  Fourteenth Precinct.  

           A few dry laughs erupt from a few of the officers.

           Nelson looks around the room scouting faces to partner 
           him with.  He finds Tompkins and smiles.

                                 NELSON
                        Right.  Pair up with Tompkins.  
                        He’ll get you squared away.

           Tompkins smirks back to Nelson and looks to Chris.  He 
           holds up five fingers and points to the exit.  

                                 NELSON (CONT’D)
                        That’s it.  Beat feet, you mutts.

           EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL, LOS ANGELES, GANG NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Tompkins drives an unmarked Crown Victoria through the 
           rough streets of South Central.  Chris stares curiously 
           through the window of the passenger seat.

           A handful of homeless crack heads panhandle for change 
           while a couple of schizophrenic bums punch and kick at 
           the air, screaming at the top of their lungs.

           Several patrol cars surround a block corner patting down 
           a group of Latino bangers.

           Teenagers who should be in school run at the sight of 
           their car as two young men on a corner pull at the 
           leashes of their pit bulls, struggling to pull the 
           enraged dogs apart.
           INT. CROWN VICTORIA- DAY

           Chris adjusts his stare between the streets and Tompkins, 
           trying to think of something to say.  Voices on the 
           police radio quietly fill the silence.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN 
                        Where are you from?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Oakland.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        No shit.  I grew up in the Bay 
                        Area.  Went to college in 
                        Washington though.

           Chris waits a beat for Tompkins to reciprocate.    

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        How long have you been with the 
                        squad?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Eighteen months.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        You’re probably ripe for a 
                        promotion.  The Sergeant’s test is 
                        coming up, right?

           Noticing Tompkins’s growing irritation with the barrage 
           of questions, Chris digresses and looks out the window.  
           Tompkins pulls up to a red light and looks hard at Chris.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Tell me something.  You came over 
                        from Fourteenth right?  There’s 
                        motherfuckers been waiting three 
                        years, begging to get on beach 
                        patrol.  Yet, you came inland.  

           Chris stares at him, unsure of where he’s taking this.

                                 TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        What?  Did you get caught with 
                        your dick stuck in some bad Venice 
                        pussy?  Get a sunburn where you’re 
                        not supposed to?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I’m married, man.

                        So.  You’re young.  Probably got a 
                        holster full of hemp condoms for

                        It’s alright.  Just be honest.

                        There’s not much to it.  I put in 
                        a lot of OV time, made some 
                        proactive arrests, and I tested 
                        well.  My Captain thought GED 
                        would be a good fit for me.

                        And my uncle, yes.

                        We all need a grease-man at the 
                        top.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Fourteenth is boring.  I wanted to 
                        keep testing myself and GED is the 
                        best.  Who wouldn’t want to be 
                        here?  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        I get it.  You wanna smash heads.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Nah...well, yeah.  I figure I’d 
                        work gangs a few years, maybe get 
                        on SWAT, fast-track to detective-

                                 TOMPKINS
                        -Ahhh.  There it is.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        What’s that?

           Tompkins pulls into a shady looking gas station and turns 
           off the engine.

                        I don’t know you from Adam and you

                        listen to me for a second.  You’re 
                        right.  There ain’t nothing wrong 
                        with ambition.  Putting on that 
                        badge, risking it all everyday 
                        because you believe in cleaning 
                        this shit-hole up without a single

                        I wasn’t saying -

                        - And there’s a thing called tact.    
                        You’ve got what, three years on 
                        the force?  I got eight years, 
                        motherfucker.  If you’re here 
                        because you think GED is going to 
                        springboard your ass to SWAT and 
                        put some stripes on your collar, 
                        line up.  Because there’s a whole 
                        bunch of motherfuckers twice as 
                        hard as you waiting nut-to-butt 
                        for the same thing and you ain't 
                        been here but a minute.  Guardian 
                        Uncle or not.  You need to re-
                        think the reasons you came here or 
                        get your head back into that hairy 
                        bohemian ass in Fourteenth. 

           Chris looks through Tompkins’s heated gaze, knowing he’s 
           said too much.

           Allen steps out of the car and leans into the window.

                        I don’t have a department card

           INT. O BANNON’S IRISH PUB, HOLLYWOOD - DAY

           Michael and Gabriel sit at the edge of the bar drinking 
           tall pints of dark beer.  Soccer plays on a small 
           television behind the bar.  The bartender, WILL (white, 
           40’s), moves about wiping down bottles.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Meacham called a couple of days 
                        ago. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        Fuck Meacham.  And what’s he doing 
                        calling you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Because he hasn’t been able to 
                        reach you for three weeks.  

                                 GABRIEL
                        Don’t worry about Meacham, I’ll 
                        take care of it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I already did.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Why would you do that?  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Because I’m your brother and it 
                        reflects poorly on me.  You can’t 
                        fuck around with these people, 
                        Gabe.  They have a low tolerance 
                        for your bullshit.  

                                 GABRIEL
                        That’s my debt.  Not yours.

           Michael hides his concern at the bottom of his pint.

                                 GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  I appreciate it.  I 
                        do.  But in the future, let me 
                        take care of my own business.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Have you been putting some away?  
                        If you need more-

                                 GABRIEL
                        -Come on, Mike.  I don’t need a 
                        lecture right now.  Leah is going 
                        to be here any minute.  I just 
                        want to watch the match.

           The front door opens and late afternoon light floods the 
           bar.  LEAH GREEN’s (white, mid-20s) tall, lean figure 
           slowly immerges through the bright halo as the door 
           closes behind her.  She has dark hair and light green 
           eyes and is exceptionally beautiful.

                                 LEAH
                        Will!  Line them up.

           She reaches Gabriel and throws her arms around his neck, 
           pulling him towards her lips.  Michael watches them for a 
           moment and looks away.

           Will lines up four shots, one for himself, and the two 
           break away from their kiss.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Cheers!

           They take the shots and Leah motions to Will for another.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How was Greece?

                                 LEAH
                        Terrible.  There were mosquitos 
                        everywhere, the food was awful, 
                        the hotel sucked, and the 
                        photographer smelled like olives.  
                        But thanks for asking, Mike. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        It’s a tough life, being a super 
                        model.  I don’t know how you deal.

                                 LEAH
                        Sorry, I’m just drained.  I need a 
                        pick-me-up.

           Michael pushes his chair back and excuses himself.  

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t say he was going to be 
                        here.

                                 GABRIEL
                        What’s your problem?

                                 LEAH
                        He’s always judging.  Every time 
                        he looks at me.

                                 GABRIEL
                        No he’s not.  He practically 
                        raised me, so you play nice.

           She leans into him and pushes her lips around his ear. 
           Her hand slowly moves up his leg.

                                 LEAH
                        I know a party where we can get 
                        some H.  There’ll be lots of 
                        pretty girls to play nice with.

           Michael pulls out his cell and scrolls through his 
           contacts until he finds the name BRETT.  He looks back 
           across the bar and watches Leah and Gabriel whispering.

                                 MICHAEL
                                 (into phone)
                        It’s Mike.  Are you free?  Blow it 
                        off and come over.  Eight o’clock.  
                        Good.  I’ll see you then.

           Michael walks back towards his seat as Leah exits the 
           bar, back into the bright light of the day.  Gabriel 
           stands up and reaches for his wallet.

                                 GABRIEL
                        We’re heading out.  We’ve got this 
                        thing.

           He hands Michael a bill.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Don’t do anything stupid.

           Gabriel smiles and heads for the exit.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Me?  Never.  

           Michael watches him leave and sinks back into his chair.  
           He looks at the bill; it’s a five.  He sighs and rubs his 
           face and orders another pint.

           Jeffery and Chris Allen sit across one another in a booth 
           eating a burger over a pitcher of beer.  Jeffery also 
           sips from a glass of scotch and is slightly inebriated.  

           The restaurant is partially full with a diverse crowd 
           eating dinner or drinking at the bar.

                        It took these guys six to eight 
                        years to make the squad.  I’ve got 
                        what, three years of easy patrol.

                        Don’t measure yourself against 
                        everyone else.  You’ve paid your 
                        dues and then some.  All that 
                        other shit will work itself out.

           Jeffery stops himself as he glances around and leans over 
           the table to make sure no one can hear him but Chris.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Those fucking niggers and spics.

                        You can’t talk like that, Uncle 
                        Jeff.

                        I’m not talking about the people 
                        you work with or the people here.  
                        I’m talking about the H in CRASH.  
                        Those monkey fucks in Compton and 
                        Inglewood.  You weren’t here in 
                        ninety-two.  It’s been eighteen 
                        years and nothing’s changed.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        It hasn’t been called CRASH for a 
                        long time.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        The only thing those people 
                        respect is the violence of action.  
                        Everyone’s a victim and no one 
                        wants to police themselves and 
                        they’re the worst.

                        I’m sorry.  I’ve been doing this

                        change.  I’m not a bad person.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN 
                        Of course not, I’m not saying 
                        that.  You’re just tired.  You’ve 
                        had a hard year. 

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        I wish Emily could see you now.  
                        The man you’ve become.

           Chris slides out of the booth and offers a warm smile.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I’ve gotta get home.  You okay?  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        What does Trevor want for his 
                        birthday?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        He’ll be three, so whatever.  He 
                        puts everything in his mouth, so 
                        as long it digests, it’s good.  

           INT. MICHAEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Michael pulls his car into the garage and walks inside 
           with a bag of Chinese food.  It’s a modest house 
           decorated with nice things, but not too ostentatious.  

           He pours himself a glass of bourbon and opens a drawer 
           full of new cell phones and lifts one out.  

           INT. DISCREET BUILDING - NIGHT

           A couple of other UC detectives sit around watching 
           monitors with headphones on as Welch answers his phone.

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        It’s me.  How’s work?

                                 WELCH
                        Quiet as a mother’s prayer.  

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        Good.  See you in two days.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WELCH
                        Alright.  

           INT. MICHAEL’S HOUSE - SAME

           Michael hangs up the phone and pulls it apart.  He takes 
           out the SIM card, breaks it in half, and throws it into 
           his garbage disposal.  He takes a sip from his bourbon 
           and checks his watch when a knocking sounds at the door.  

           He opens the door to BRETT HURLEY (black, late 20s).  She 
           is average height, curvy, and beautiful, with black curly 
           hair and speaks with a British accent.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t know why you still knock.

           He smiles and moves aside for her to walk past.

           INT. MICHAEL’S HOUSE, BAR - LATER

           She affectionately watches him pour them both a glass of 
           red wine.  They hold their glasses up and laugh at his 
           toast.  The Chinese food sits eaten on the bar in front 
           of them.

           EXT. MICHAEL’S HOUSE, PATIO - LATER

           They stand outside on his patio looking over the city.  
           The view is spectacular.  She smiles at him adoringly.  
           The distant lights twinkle in front of them.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Every time I come out here the 
                        lights have pushed the edge of the 
                        city further away.  

                                 BRETT
                        I don’t like feeling so small.

           He slowly leans in to kiss her, but she turns her head 
           and grabs his hand.  She places it on her heart for a 
           moment before sliding it over her breast.  

           She leads him back into the house, towards the bedroom.

           INT. WEST HOLLYWOOD, HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Gabriel’s eyelids swing abruptly open.  He sits up from 
           the floor and orients himself to the strange room.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A COUPLE lies asleep, naked on the bed beside him.  His 
           pants and his shirt are scattered around the room.  

           He checks his watch, it reads 5:08 am.  He dresses and 
           walks into the bathroom to find Leah asleep, half clothed 
           in a large bathtub next to another model.  He smiles to 
           himself and wakes her.

           EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD, STREET - SAME

           Gabriel and Leah stumble down the street towards Denny’s.  
           The joy of last night’s drugs and alcohol are turning 
           into physical pain.  

                                 LEAH
                        Fucking call someone.

           Gabriel pulls a cell phone from his pocket and dials a 
           number.

                                 GABRIEL
                                 (into the phone)
                        I need a ride.  I can’t.  Because 
                        I lost my wallet.  The Denny’s on 
                        Sunset.  

           INT. MICHAEL’S BMW - MORNING

           Michael drives up the Denny’s parking lot, into a space 
           just outside the window of the booth where Gabriel and 
           Leah have landed.  He stares sadly at them and honks.  
           Gabriel wakes up, gathers his senses, and spots Michael 
           through the window.  He smiles and wakes Leah.

           INT. LAPD, SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS UNIT HQ - DAY

           Lanier, Payton, and Ling sit around a group of desks 
           making calls and looking over files.  OTHER DETECTIVES 
           are busy at work around the large room. 

           Jeffery Allen arrives carrying a box of bagels and a 
           carafe of coffee.  He looks worn out and sleepless, 
           despite an energetic presence.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Good morning everyone.  

           Surprised, they respond in kind as he places the bagels 
           and the coffee in the center for everyone to share.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        What do you have for me, Ling?

                                 LING
                        I’ve consolidated all the witness 
                        statements, but you won’t find 
                        anything you don’t know already.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        They leave anything behind?

                                 LING
                        Forensics didn’t find a single 
                        hair or fingerprint.  

           Lanier picks up a stack of files from his desk and sets 
           them in front of Jeffery.

                                 LANIER
                        I ran through every armed robbery 
                        the last three years and matched 
                        ours with nine others in the 
                        greater metropolitan area.  You 
                        name it, they’ve hit it - a 
                        computer factory, armored truck,  
                        a chemical plant.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        That’s why we haven’t connected 
                        them.

                                 LANIER
                        In every case the crew was 
                        completely disguised, spoke 
                        Spanish, and came heavily armed.

                                 LING
                        This was their second bank.  The 
                        first was in Van Nuys two years 
                        ago.  They killed a security 
                        guard.  Ballistics never found a 
                        match.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Find out if there’s a pattern to 
                        what they’re stealing.  Or if any 
                        of it’s linked somehow through 
                        business associations or 
                        insurance.
                                 (to Lanier)
                        Anything from our informants?  

                                 LANIER
                        Not worth mentioning.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Who’d the safety deposit box 
                        belong to?

                        A wealthy Saudi business man named 
                        Abdullah Ahmed Abbas.  He married 
                        a French Canadian woman in 
                        Vancouver in nineteen eighty-nine 
                        and conveniently died there two 
                        weeks ago.  The cause is still 
                        unknown.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Why would he keep a box there?  
                        Did you contact his wife? 

                                 PAYTON
                        I did.  No one in his family knew 
                        a thing about it.

           Jeffery smiles and rubs his temples.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        What do we know?  We know nothing. 
                        Call up every detective who worked 
                        on these cases and find out if 
                        something was left out.  We got 
                        some cash to spend, let’s use it.  
                        Lean harder on the informants.  
                        What’s told in the ear of one man 
                        is heard a hundred miles away in 
                        this city.  Someone knows 
                        something about this fucking crew.    

           EXT. MOM AND POP GROCERY STORE, PARKING LOT - DAY

           The grocery store doors push open as Michael makes his 
           way through the exit carrying a small bag of fruit.

           He approaches his car and notices two men have fallen in 
           behind him.  He turns to find Shabot and Feldman.

                                 MICHAEL
                        They have the best fruit in town

                        Mr. Lustick wants to see you.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           The foamy ocean water sinks into the soft sand and 
           disappears under the feet of RICHARD LUSTICK (40s/50s).  
           Tall and muscular with deep set eyes and dark, well 
           groomed hair, he stares out into the Pacific holding his 
           shoes at his side, his suit pants rolled up to his knees.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A moment later, Michael reaches Lustick who extends his 
           hand.  Feldman and Shabot follow at a short distance as 
           Lustick leads him down the beach.  He speaks with a 
           slight Israeli accent through partially crooked front 
           teeth.

                                 LUSTICK
                        In eighty-two, I was running a 
                        team in Beirut.  Our mission was 
                        to find covert pockets of the PLO 
                        and, well you can figure out the 
                        rest.  One night we do a raid on a 
                        known safe house and it’s empty 
                        when we arrive.  There’s food 
                        cooking in the oven, fresh bread 
                        on the table, and tea steaming 
                        from the pot, but no one around.  
                        I’m thinking maybe they caught 
                        wind of us and ran.  We must’ve 
                        just missed them.  We’d hardly 
                        eaten in days so one of my men 
                        opens the oven to see what has the 
                        house smelling so good and 
                        detonates ten pounds of explosives 
                        stuffed inside a chicken.  In a 
                        moment of hunger he forgot all of 
                        his training and peeked where he 
                        shouldn’t have been peeking.  

           Michael looks quizzically at Lustick.  

                                 LUSTICK (CONT’D)
                        There was a counter installed 
                        inside the box to track how many 
                        times it’s been opened.  It didn’t 
                        read zeroes when it arrived to me.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What are you talking about?

                                 LUSTICK
                        I was very specific when I said no 
                        one was to look inside.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s right.  And no one did.  No 
                        one but me could’ve...and I sure 
                        as shit didn’t.

           Lustick finds a sudden trace of doubt on Michael’s face 
           as he calmly recounts the events to himself.  

                                 LUSTICK
                        You don’t look so certain.

                        I don’t believe you.

                                 LUSTICK
                        You’ve placed me in a very 
                        peculiar situation.  I should find 
                        your fuck-up brother and torture 
                        you both until you give up your 
                        crew.  Then sink all of you in 
                        stress positions to the bottom of 
                        the Mariana.    

                                 MICHAEL
                        You touch a hair on Gabriel or 
                        anyone I know and there are no 
                        limits to how far-

                                 LUSTICK
                        -You’re hardly in a position to be 
                        threatening anyone.  There’s a 
                        reason you work for me and not the 
                        other way around.  

           A beat as neither refuses to break their vigorous stare.

                                 LUSTICK (CONT’D)
                        There’s a second half to the job. 
                        I had planned on using another 
                        crew in order to keep everything 
                        sub rosa, but now I’m sure you 
                        feel obligated to use yours.  
                        You’ll not be paid for the bank 
                        unless you succeed, which I assure 
                        you will be considerably more 
                        difficult.  This will be your last 
                        job.  After which you will 
                        dissolve your crew, leave the West 
                        Coast, and never return.  Those 
                        are my only terms.  If you refuse 
                        or fail, well, you can figure out 
                        the rest. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        We get what you were offering the 
                        other crew.  And I want your word 
                        Gabe will be left alone if 
                        something should happen to me.

                                 LUSTICK
                        I’ll think about it.  But don’t 
                        mistake my kindness for weakness.

           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 MICHAEL
                        What’s the job?

                                 LUSTICK
                        My boys will fill you in with the 
                        details.  We’ve got a warehouse 
                        set up for you to prep.  I’ll get 
                        back to you with the time.  

           Michael scowls at him and turns to walk away.  

                                 LUSTICK (CONT’D)
                        And Mike, what you didn’t see with 
                        your eyes, don’t witness with your 
                        mouth.  There’s only a handful of 
                        people who know what was in that 
                        box, and my clients have gone to 
                        great lengths to keep it that way. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           The large warehouse is a dark and dingy old building.  
           Cages full of dusty boxes and furniture line the aluminum 
           walls.  An actual sized model of the second job’s 
           interior has been constructed with plywood in the middle 
           of the one room building.  It is detailed down to the 
           metal detectors and furniture.

           Gabriel, Tompkins, Rodriguez, and Welch stand around an 
           old pool table in a corner of the building drinking beer 
           and laughing.  A dusty, antique chandelier hangs above 
           their heads softly lighting the mood and their faces.

           Michael arrives and watches them for a moment before 
           announcing his presence.  

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        New office?  What is this?

           Michael smiles and tosses a gym bag onto the table.  
           Gabriel opens it to find four bundles of cash marked with 
           their names.

                                 WELCH
                        To the victor go the spoils.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I got seventy cents on the dollar.  
                        That’s eighty-five per bundle.  

           Gabriel smells his bundle and kisses it.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GABRIEL
                        You could’ve just set this on ice 
                        for me in the Chairman’s Suite.  I 
                        have it reserved under Raymond 
                        Babbitt.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        What’s up, Mike?  You don’t look 
                        too pleased.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Lustick came to see me today.

           The air is sucked from the room.  

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        What for?

                                 MICHAEL
                        One of you knows, because one of 
                        you opened the box.  

           Michael looks over them calmly.  

                                 GABRIEL
                        Bullshit.  You distinctly told us 
                        not to look.  He’s playing you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        There was a counter installed 
                        inside.  Someone peeked.

           Michael watches as the others look mistrustfully at one 
           another, holding his stare a beat longer on Gabriel.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        So who the fuck did it?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Don’t look at me!

                                 GABRIEL
                        It could’ve been one of Lustick’s 
                        guys.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It doesn’t matter.  It’s done, and 
                        if you’re smart you’ll keep it to 
                        yourself.  We’ve got a bigger 
                        problem now.

                                 WELCH
                        What do you mean?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MICHAEL
                        It was a two part job all along.  
                        Lustick was planning on using 
                        another crew, hence the new 
                        office, but now we have to do it 
                        or he’s gonna put us down.  

                                 GABRIEL
                        He knows who I am, Mike!  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes, he does.  He doesn’t know the 
                        rest of you, but I promise he’ll 
                        go to great lengths to find out.  
                        And he won’t stop with you.  He’ll 
                        go after your girlfriends and 
                        wives and family, everyone until 
                        he’s satisfied.

           Welch, Rodriguez, and Tompkins look to one another with 
           deep concern as Gabriel paces the room.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        This is our last job.  We’re done 
                        after this.  We have no choice.  

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Fuck Lustick.  Why don’t we just 
                        kill him before he gets to us?

                                 GABRIEL
                        Is that a joke?  He’d cut off your 
                        dick and wouldn’t tell you the 
                        time of day if you were bleeding 
                        to death at his feet.  Hamas has 
                        tried to kill him for twenty years 
                        and you think we’re gonna get to 
                        him?  

                                 MICHAEL
                        He’s offering two and a half plus 
                        guaranteed plunder for the second 
                        job.  He’ll pay the million he 
                        still owes for the bank if and 
                        only if it gets done, and not a 
                        second before.   

                                 WELCH
                        What makes you think he won’t just 
                        kill us rather than pay us.

                                 MICHAEL
                        There’s no guarantee, but if we do 
                        it there’s at least a chance we 
                        live and make out ahead.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s an unmarked Homeland Security 
                        building just east of LAX.  DHS 
                        uses the building to store 
                        sensitive materials coming in and 
                        out of the country.  It’s not 
                        going to be easy.

           A beat.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        We’ve worked together a long time.  
                        I don’t give a damn who looked in 
                        the box.  I’m over it.  But I’m 
                        doing this with or without you so 
                        make your decisions.  Otherwise, 
                        take your chances and leave, but 
                        you’ve gotta disappear now. 

           Michael looks them over as they contemplate the 
           situation.  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        You ain’t leaving us much of a 
                        choice.

                                 WELCH
                        I’m not going anywhere.  LA’s my 
                        home.  I’m with you, Mike.  

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Fuck it.  I ain’t running.  If 
                        it’s the last score, I’m in.

           All eyes turn to Tompkins.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        What are we after?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Let’s not make the same mistake 
                        twice.  That stays with me this 
                        time. 

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Think of your wife, man.  You 
                        gonna tell her?  Put her on the 
                        lam?

           Tompkins looks them over for a beat and finally nods.

           Michael scowls cruelly at Gabriel.

           INT. INTERIOR MODEL, WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Tompkins and Rodriguez run through the model doors 
           towards the mock X-ray station.  They take down Gabriel 
           and Michael who act as guards.  Welch records the time.  

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        The building is located in a gated 
                        complex called Industrial Village.  
                        Approach and exit are easy, but 
                        once we’re inside it gets 
                        considerably difficult.  

           Michael leads the crew down a long hallway into a mock 
           foyer.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        They use basic alarm safeguards 
                        through the LAPD, but there’s a 
                        hitch.

           Tompkins and Rodriguez apply a simulated explosive device 
           around the frame of the vault door.  

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        The vault automatically locks when 
                        the silent alarm is triggered and 
                        can’t be opened until it’s reset. 

                                 WELCH (V.O.)
                        Or?

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        Or we do it the old fashioned way.

           Again, Welch records their time.

                                 GABRIEL
                        And the rest of the guards?

                                 MICHAEL
                        They outsource security through 
                        TSA.  The two inside the door, two 
                        roving, and another at the lobby 
                        desk.  

           Michael points to the two office doors leading from the 
           foyer as he leads them into the vault.

                        The offices hold at least a dozen 
                        employees, and on top of that we 
                        won’t have a layout of the vault.  
                        We’re going to have to plan for 
                        time to search through it once 
                        we’re inside.  

                                 WELCH
                        That puts us around eight, eight 
                        and half minutes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m thinking more like ten.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME

           The crew stand around the pool table.  The stacks of 
           money lie in front of them.  Rodriguez opens a beer.

                                 GABRIEL
                        It can’t be done.  There’s no way.

                                 WELCH
                        Gabe’s right.  They’ll be on us in 
                        three minutes, tops.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Then we need to buy time.  We’ve 
                        got to figure out a way to keep 
                        units away for as long as 
                        possible.  Ideas?  

           Tompkins, Welch, and Rodriguez look to one another for.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        We could set off a couple fire 
                        alarms a few miles away.  Or call 
                        in a terrorist threat.

                                 WELCH
                        That’ll just stir up the LAFD and 
                        put HLS building on lock-down, 
                        which won’t be much good to us.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’ve got to think bigger.  
                        Whatever trades us minutes. 

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        I’ve got something.  I thought 
                        about bringing it up before but we 
                        never had a need.  We could stage 
                        a 999.

                        Hold up, man.  That’s pretty

                        When an officer is killed or 
                        wounded or is in some form of dire 
                        straights, he calls in a triple-
                        nine.  Radios switch to a 
                        predetermined station and all 
                        active units in the area converge 
                        on the downed officer.  Like that, 
                        it’s safeties off.  It’s open 
                        season on cop killers and everyone 
                        wants a piece.  It’s standard 
                        operating procedure.  

                                 WELCH
                        I’ve actually been on one, years 
                        ago when I was on patrol.  It was 
                        like the city unplugged and 
                        drained the entire LAPD into one 
                        sewer.  I remember thinking if 
                        someone wanted, they’d have a free 
                        run at the rest of the city.

                                 RODRIGUEZ

                        tee we’ll have every cruiser out 
                        of our area in seconds.

                                 GABRIEL
                        But, you’d have to shoot a cop.  

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Yeah.  It’s too bad you’re not one 
                        anymore.  You’d be perfect. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        Fuck you, Rod.

                        Funny thing is, you’re the last 
                        person I thought would have a 
                        problem with killing.

           Gabriel turns red with anger and Michael quickly 
           diffuses.

                        in a couple of days.  

           Welch, Tompkins, and Rodriguez grab their stack of cash, 
           open the door, and disappear into the night.  Gabriel 
           counts a few thousand dollars from his stack.

                                 GABRIEL
                        I guess I ain’t going to Vegas.

           He places the money on the table in front of Michael.

           EXT. STREET CORNER, SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Tompkins and Chris pull up to a murder scene in their 
           Crown Victoria.  The intersection is blocked off with 
           patrol cars, flares, and yellow tape.  

           Large crowds have formed on opposite sides of the street.  
           The majority of them are black and most of the young men 
           wear blue.

           Tompkins and Chris work their way towards Rodriguez who 
           kneels over a young black man named DARIOUS IRVING (17), 
           lying bullet ridden in a thick pool of blood and 
           splintered bone.

                                 TOMPKINS

                        their imitation Armani suits.  
                        Careful you don’t get it stained.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        I’m not worried.  I’ve got two.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Chris Allen...Detective Rodriguez.

                        How’s it hanging?

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Long and to the left.  

           Tompkins squats beside Irving and stares into his dry, 
           lifeless eyes while Rodriguez pulls out the dead man’s 
           wallet and rummages for his identification.

                                 RODRIGUEZ (CONT’D)
                        You know him.

                        Darious Irving.

                                 RODRIGUEZ

                        P Stone Bloods, off Crenshaw.  I 
                        don’t know what he’s doing over 
                        here.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Getting himself fucked up is what.

           Rodriguez and Tompkins gaze coldly at Chris, who’s failed 
           attempt at humor has turned himself red.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        This definitely wasn’t a spray and 
                        pray.  His wounds are bruised and 
                        cauterized so he was shot at close 
                        range, which means he probably 
                        knew the motherfuckers.  He comes 
                        out of the store, they drive up, 
                        call him, he walks up to the car, 
                        bam...dead cold as wintry weather.

                                 TOMPKINS

                        We’ll see what we can find out.

           Rodriguez nods and looks at Chris who has been quietly 
           fixated on Irving’s body.  Tompkins rolls his eyes.

                        out what kind of car these 
                        motherfuckers were driving.

           Chris snaps from his comatose stare and heads across the 
           street towards the crowd.  Rodriguez laughs and shakes 
           his head as Tompkins turns towards the opposite side of 
           the road.

           Tompkins approaches a CROWD standing calmly behind the 
           police barricade.  He immediately recognizes a face in 
           the group: BRANDON SUGGS.  Suggs’s face is badly bruised.

                                 TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        Who’d you piss off?

                        Man, I know when you run from the 
                        cops you’re gonna get tuned up 
                        some.  I’m cool with that.  I’m 
                        not gonna complain.  But these 
                        guys crossed the line.  It was 
                        fucking ridiculous.

           Tompkins laughs and shakes his hand.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Are they here?

                                 SUGGS
                        Nah.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        What are you running for anyway?

                                 SUGGS
                        Because I needed exercise.  Why 
                        the fuck you think?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        You can’t use that excuse anymore.

                                 SUGGS
                        Yeah?  Check your boy.

           Tompkins turns around and peers across the street.  The 
           crowd is growing loud and restless, pointing their 
           fingers at Chris who raises his hands for calm.  Tompkins 
           watches for a moment and slowly make his way back across 
           the road.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Hey!  Calm down.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           The crowd is led and fueled by DESHAUN MILLER (20s).  
           Dressed heavily in blue clothing, his skin is littered 
           with tattoos and scars.  He stands face to face with 
           Chris, separated only by yellow tape.

                                 DESHAUN MILLER
                        You calm down, officer Allen.  You 
                        can’t come over here and blame us 
                        for X-ing out that nigga.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I didn’t say that.  Don’t put 
                        words in my mouth.

                                 DESHAUN MILLER
                        That’s exactly what you said.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        No it’s not.  I said one of you 
                        had to have seen something.

                                 DESHAUN MILLER
                        You’re a lying pig.

           Chris’s demeanor changes instantly.  The two gauge one 
           another like pit bulls.  Miller leans in close to Chris.

                                 DESHAUN MILLER (CONT’D)
                        Roll up under this tape and I’ll 
                        get balls deep in that pink virgin 
                        ass, you punk faggot.

           Chris doesn’t hesitate.  He thrusts his fist into 
           Miller's head and kicks his legs out from under him.  He 
           turns him onto his belly and drags him under the tape.  
           The crowd erupts into screams and chants of brutality as 
           other officers run over to assist.  

           Chris puts the cuffs over DeShaun's wrists and knees into 
           his back victoriously as Tompkins walks up.  Tompkins

           INT.  STORE, CRIME SCENE - SAME

           Tompkins pushes open the glass door and Chris follows him 
           inside.  Tompkins locks the door behind them.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        What the fuck you think you’re 
                        doing?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        What I had to.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Throw a nigga down and incite a 
                        fucking riot?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        No.  Bullshit.  He threatened me.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        So!  Get used to it!  They ain’t a 
                        prison large enough to house every

                        They fight back over here.  You 
                        even know who that is?  

           Chris shakes his head.

                                 TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        You even know where the hell you 
                        are?!

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Fuck off, Terrell.  I can read a 
                        map.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        What does your map say, Big Timer?

           Chris looks at him without an answer.

                                 TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        You’re in the Rollin 40s.  Crip 
                        country.  That ain’t on your GPS!  
                        And that nigga you just gassed up 
                        in front of his whole neighborhood 
                        is DeShaun Miller, a Rolling 40’s 
                        lieutenant.  And you probably just 
                        promoted his ass.  

           Chris’s face turns solemn and apologetic.

                        You think anyone’s gonna talk to 
                        us now?  You just made yourself 
                        public enemy number one to these 
                        people.  Not to mention you 
                        probably just made this case 
                        virtually unsolvable.  

           Chris stands in front of him momentarily speechless.  
           Tompkins walks to the door and unlocks it.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        I want you to use your fucking 
                        brain.  This ain’t patrol.  Big

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I mean about DeShaun.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        You can’t let him go now, can you?  
                        Figure it out your damn self.  And 
                        find your own damn ride doing it.

           The bell above the door rings as Tompkins pushes it open 
           and steps out of the store.  Chris looks around the store 
           for a moment, uncertain of what to do next.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Fucking prick.

           EXT. CHRIS ALLEN’S NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

           Chris and Michelle push strollers carrying Trevor and 
           Tabitha down the sidewalk as the day closes around them.    

                                 MICHELLE

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I’m sorry.  I’ve still got 
                        Tompkins’s voice screaming in my 
                        head.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s only been a few days.

                        And already I feel like an 
                        imposter.

                        from him.  You’re not going to 
                        impress any of them overnight.  
                        You know better than anyone that 
                        kind of respect is earned slowly.

                        I impressed you overnight.

                        Not by acting like a patsy.  And 
                        it was your uniform and tequila 
                        that got me over FOR the night.  
                        But it was the rest of you that 
                        earned my love.  You’re the most 
                        incredible man I know, Chris, but 
                        you’re also the most impatient.

                        That’s right, crime-fighter.

           Chris smiles and whispers into her ear.  She laughs and 
           pushes his arm away.

           INT. LAPD, SPECIAL UNIT INVESTIGATIONS HQ - NIGHT

           Jeffery Allen fumbles through files on top of his messy 
           desk.  The fading sounds of voices and laughter grab his 
           attention.  He peeks out of the office and watches his 
           team leave.  Alone, he opens his desk drawer and pulls 
           out a bottle of Scotch.  

           He pours himself a tall drink, pulls out a blanket and 
           pillow from a wall locker, kicks off his tie and shoes, 
           and lies on an old couch.  The Scotch rests on his chest, 
           rising with every slow breath. 

           He looks over pictures of the crew collected from video 
           inside the bank with a magnifying lens for a moment 
           before he reaches up and turns off the light.  
           INT. BOOTH, THE PRINCE CAFE, KOREA TOWN - NIGHT

           Tompkins sits facing Welch and Rodriguez as they talk

                        the toughest, but clearest 
                        solution.  I think you know that.

                        I ain’t arguing that, but you’re 
                        talking about turning our three 
                        Holiest numbers into a euphemism 
                        for premeditated murder.  That 
                        don’t come without consequences, 
                        and I’m not talking about the ones 
                        given us if we’re caught.

                        That may be true, but we’re in a 
                        situation where there’s a clear 
                        divide between necessity and 
                        conscience, and we’ve been on the 
                        side of necessity for a long time.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        First, we ain’t getting caught.  
                        And second, fuck all that police 
                        code, brothers in blue bullshit.  
                        Since when did you start placing  
                        so much value on life, Terrell.  
                        You see motherfuckers killed every 
                        week in the hood and you call them 
                        statistics.  All the sudden you’re 
                        gonna get saintly because a 
                        motherfucker wears a shield.

                        If he has a wife she’s gonna 
                        deposit that insurance check, jump 
                        on a cruise, and celebrate getting

           Chris breathes heavily for a moment, rubbing the sweat 
           from his face.  Michelle, just as sweaty, is planted on 
           top of him as they make love between a mess of sheets.

           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Chris and Michelle sit across one another snacking on 
           wine and fruit.  Chris is completely naked.  Michelle is 
           dressed only in one of his old LAPD tee shirts. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I spoke to Alicia Tompkins for an 
                        hour on the phone this morning.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        As in my partner Tompkins?

                                 MICHELLE
                        As in his wife.

           Chris stares at her, waiting for more information.

                        She’s very nice.  I invited them 
                        over for dinner.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Wait...what?  Why?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Because I don’t have many friends 
                        and I want to get to know the 
                        people I have the privilege of 
                        sharing you with everyday.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I wish you would’ve asked me.

                                 MICHELLE
                        If I ever NEED your permission,  
                        just assume I already have it.

           Chris laughs and leans in to kiss her.  A speaker on the 
           kitchen counter comes alive with the slow cry of a waking 
           child.  Michelle gets up to tend to the baby.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Alicia says Terrell likes ribs.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Now I have to cook, too?

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE, TOP FLOOR - DAY

           Michael, Gabriel, Tompkins, Rodriguez, and Welch huddle 
           around Michael’s car with no one else in sight.  Los 
           Angeles sprawls out around them in all directions.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        His name’s Chris Allen.  He’s my 
                        new partner.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        And you’re okay with this?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Yeah.  It won’t be a problem. 

                                 WELCH
                        The kid’s got an uncle in SIU 
                        who’s actually running our case.  
                        He’s somewhat of a legend.

                        He was a character witness for the 
                        defense in the Rodney King trials, 
                        but his testimony got tossed for 
                        calling King a ‘bush whookie’ to 
                        some reporter.  He’s old school. 
                        Once he hears his nephew’s down, 
                        he’ll have every swinging dick he 
                        can muster moving to the call.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        I’ll see to it that I’m brought in 
                        to clean up any mistakes.  Divert 
                        suspicion where it needs to go.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re all in agreement?

           Welch and Rodriguez are confident, but a slight trace of 
           doubt resides in Tompkins’s eyes.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Why can’t you just wound him?

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        That’ll work.  That way he can 
                        wake up and identify who shot him.

                                 MICHAEL
                                 (to Gabriel)
                        I’m open to other ideas if you 
                        have any.

           Gabriel looks as though he wants to speak, but digresses.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Okay then.  It’s settled.  There’s 
                        no turning back from this point.  
                        We are in forward motion.  

                                 GABRIEL
                        Does he have a family?  Kids?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Stop right there.  The details of 
                        Allen’s life aren’t to be 
                        discussed.  The only one who 
                        speaks to or of him is Terrell.
                                 (to Terrell)
                        Keep it normal.  Earn his trust so 
                        you can get him where he needs to 
                        be, but don’t get any closer to 
                        this kid than you have to, so 
                        there is no hesitation, no inkling 
                        of doubt, you can’t do this when 
                        the bells start tolling.

                        As for the rest of us, the kid is 
                        dead already.  He never existed.

           EXT. STREETS, SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Tompkins and Chris move through the rough neighborhoods 
           in the Crown Victoria.  Chris occasionally eyes Tompkins 
           to gauge his mood.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        This is MS-Thirteen area, right?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Yep.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        All the way up to Vermont Avenue?

           Tompkins nods.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        And they’re beefing hard against 
                        Rollin’ Forties now, aren’t they?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Beefing?

           Chris shrugs his shoulders and smiles.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I heard you say it.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        You know why they’re ‘beefing’?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Because the Forties gunned down 
                        one of their leaders, Sylvester 
                        Morales.  For cutting up some 
                        hooker the Forties pimp out.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        You’ve been studying.  Good. 
                        Knowledge is power on the streets.  
                        This job don’t stop when you turn 
                        the keys in at the end of the day.  

           Chris looks out the window to hide his smile.  He’s 
           finally done something right.
           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD, SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

           Tompkins pulls up to a corner and parks on the street in 
           front of a house.  TWO OLD MEN play chess on the porch.  
           Directly across the road a handful of CRIPS sit on a 
           porch watching them.  A couple pull blue bandanas off 
           their necks and cover their faces.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Hang out for a few.  I’ll be back.

           Tompkins steps out of the car and walks towards the porch 
           to chat with the old men.  Chris crawls out of his seat 
           and leans against the car, studying the block.

           A few of the NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS walk up.  It isn’t long 
           before Chris is half surrounded.  He watches as a couple 
           of the bangers jump from the porch and walk towards him.

                                 KID #1
                        Who are you?  I ain’t seen you 
                        here before.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I’m Officer Allen.  What’s your 
                        name?

                                 KID #1
                        Why you wanna know my name?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        You know mine.  It’s only polite 
                        to tell me yours.

                                 KID #2
                        He wants to arrest us.

                                 BANGER #1.
                        You that cop that busted up 
                        DeShaun the other night.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        That was a misunderstanding.

                                 BANGER #2
                        We’ve got other names for it.

                                 KID #2
                        That was you?  I told you he 
                        wanted to arrest us.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Why aren’t you kids in class?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I’ve got a question for you 
                        professor?  

           The kids burst into taunting laughter as Chris friendly 
           challenges the banger.  

                                 BANGER #1.
                        What you got?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I see you’ve got your colors on.  
                        Your rocking a pimp limp.  You’re 
                        proud of your set.

                                 BANGER #1.
                        For sure.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Tell me then, who’s the founder of 
                        the Crips, and what was the 
                        original name of the gang?

           Banger #1 stands silently searching for the answer.  

                                 BANGER #2
                        He don’t know!

           Again, the kids erupt into laughter and taunt Banger #1.

                                 BANGER #1.
                        He don’t know either.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        It was formed by Raymond 
                        Washington in 1969 and they called 
                        themselves the Cribs.

                                 BANGER #1
                        Bullshit!  Ain’t nobody ever call 
                        it Cribs!

           Across the street DeShaun Miller steps out of the house 
           and joins the other bangers who remained on the porch.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Chris locks eyes with Miller who forms his hand in the 
           shape of a gun and motions it towards Chris.  Tompkins’s 
           voice arrives behind him.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        You kids get to school or I’m 
                        gonna arrest your mamas.

           The kids disperse as Chris jumps back into the car.  As 
           they drive away, he locks eyes again with DeShaun, who 
           gives him a parting smile.

           EXT. GABRIEL’S HOUSE, LAUREL CANYON - DAY

           Michael pulls a large white van into the driveway.  
           Gabriel’s door is wide open as Michael crosses the front 
           yard.  He is dressed in workman’s clothes.

           Leah storms out of the house carrying a bag and a purse.  
           Her clothes are disheveled and her hair is a mess.  

                                 LEAH
                        Beautiful, aren’t I.

                        What happened?  Where’s Gabe?

                                 LEAH
                        He’s all yours.

           INT. GABRIEL’S HOUSE, LAUREL CANYON - SAME

           Gabriel kneels over broken glass in the living room.  The 
           kitchen is overrun with dirty dishes and boxes of half 
           eaten food and bottles of beer and wine.  Clothes and 
           shoes line the hallway.  

           Gabriel looks up and smiles when he sees Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What was that all about?

                                 GABRIEL
                        It’s melodramatic week on Planet 
                        Leah.  

           Gabriel cuts himself on a piece of glass and watches a 
           small pool of blood form on his fingertip.  He looks up 
           and locks eyes momentarily with Michael.  
           INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY

           Michael and Gabriel push two buggies full of supplies 
           into separate cashier lanes.  It’s a mix of materials 
           they need for the job and materials for the receipt.

           EXT. HOME DEPOT, PARKING LOT - DAY

           Michael opens the back of the van and rummages through 
           the bags.  He separates what they need from what they 
           don’t.  Gabriel, looking sick, watches the parking lot.

           EXT. JUNK YARD - DAY

           Michael pulls the van into a fenced compound full of old 
           vehicles waiting to be stripped.  He rolls down his 
           window and greets the FOREMAN with an envelope.  The 
           foreman points him to the corner of the lot.  

           Gabriel gets out and opens the trunk of a rusty, wheel-
           less Cadillac.  He pulls out a box and inspects the 
           contents: RDX materials, zero-ductility ceramic cones, 
           detonation cord, and blasting caps.  He closes the box 
           and carries it with him back into the van.

           INT. MICHAEL’S VAN - EVENING

           Michael drives carefully through Laurel Canyon, 
           repeatedly checking his mirrors.

                                 MICHAEL
                        After this job, I want you to come 
                        with me.

           Gabriel laughs to himself and shakes his head.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious.  

                                 GABRIEL
                        Isn’t it ironic we call what we do 
                        a ‘job.’  

                                 MICHAEL
                        What else would we call it?

           Michael pulls into Gabriel’s driveway.  Gabriel sits for 
           a moment staring at his feet.  He turns to Michael.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 GABRIEL
                        You’re not seriously going through 
                        with this?  We’re not going to 
                        murder a cop, are we?

                                 MICHAEL
                        If we don’t do this job, Lustick 
                        will find us and he will kill us.  
                        Do you understand?

                                 GABRIEL
                        Yeah.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Say it then.

                                 GABRIEL
                        He’ll find us and he will kill us. 

           Gabriel opens the van door and slams it shut behind him.  
           He enters the dark house and turns off the porch light.

           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jeffery Allen plays with Trevor and Tabitha at the dining 
           room table while Michelle and Chris cook dinner.  Jeffery 
           is enamored by the children.  His cell phone rings.

           INT. LAPD, SPECIAL UNIT INVESTIGATIONS HQ - NIGHT

           Lanier is working late from his desk.  

                                 LANIER
                                 (into phone)
                        Got a call from one of your old 
                        CI’s today.  A guy named Tommy 
                        Sanders.  He says he might have a 
                        lead on our crew.

           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jeffery walks onto the back porch.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        I haven’t heard that name in a 
                        while.  We’ll run him down 
                        tomorrow.  We’ve got nothing else.

           He hangs up his phone and heads back into the kitchen and 
           grabs his keys.  He gives the children each a kiss.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Yeah.  I put a little on the game.  
                        Probably best I do my screaming 
                        from home.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Alright.  I’ll save you some ribs.

           The doorbell rings as Jeffery stops to kiss Michelle on 
           the cheek.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        You’re an angel.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        See you next week?

           Jeffery and Chris walk towards the front door.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Absolutely.

           Chris opens the front door to find Tompkins and his wife 
           Alicia (black, late 20s) holding bottles of wine.

           Chris and Michelle push through an awkward moment of 
           friendly introductions before Michelle grabs Alicia and 
           escorts her to the kitchen leaving the men alone.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Terrell, Uncle Jeffery’s in 
                        robbery.  He’s heading up the 
                        investigation of that bank crew 
                        Sergeant Nelson briefed us about 
                        the other day.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        I remember.  How’s that going?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Not good.  I’m having to chase 
                        every damn lead we get.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Cast a wide net, you’re bound to 
                        catch something.  Right?

           Jeffery gives Chris a strong hug and Tompkins a strong 
           handshake and crosses the yard towards his car.

           Tompkins follows Chris towards the kitchen gazing at the 
           pictures hanging from the walls.

           He stops in front of a large frame containing a silver 
           star, a unit crest, several rows of ribbons, captain’s 
           bars, and a picture of Chris on top of a mountain in 
           Afghanistan with friends.    

                                 TOMPKINS
                        You never mentioned you were in 
                        the service?

                        Army.  101st Airborne.  

           Tompkins peers at Chris staring reverentially at the 
           collage before taking in the other photos.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Get you a beer?

           EXT. CHRIS ALLEN’S BACK YARD - NIGHT

           The two couples sit around a deck table.  Dirty plates, 
           beer bottles, wine glasses, and a baby speaker rest in 
           front of them.  Chris, Alicia, and Michelle are caught up 
           in light-hearted conversation.  Tompkins watches them 
           quietly.

           A moment later Michelle leans into Alicia to get a look 
           at her new diamond earrings.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                                 (to Tompkins)
                        The ribs were awful, weren’t they?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        What’d you rub them in?  Kimchi?
                        They’re gonna burn my ass for 
                        weeks.

           Chris laughs heartily as Alicia and Michelle stand up to 
           clear the table.  The men stand to offer the ladies help.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You two sit back down.  We need 
                        time to talk behind your backs.

           Michelle winks at Chris and kisses him gently on the lips 
           as she leans in to grab his plate.  The two watch the 
           ladies move inside and shuffle around the kitchen.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I want to apologize for the way 
                        things have gotten off.

                        I ain’t accepting apologies.  
                        There ain’t a need.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I lost my head.  I know better.
                        It’s just the Army, the war, it 
                        all came so natural to me.  I’ve 
                        been out just over three years and 
                        nothing I do feels right.  I keep 
                        looking for something that brings 
                        it back, but I can’t shake the 
                        feeling I might not be as good at 
                        anything else.  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        What we do, it’s like the war.  
                        They don’t want us there, and 
                        apart from us, no one else gives a 
                        damn.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I’m beyond asking for thanks.     
                        It’s that sense of purpose I want. 

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Get over yourself, Chris.  Stop 
                        thinking about how good you’re 
                        doing your job and focus on the 
                        good your job is doing.  You’ll 
                        find your purpose.

           Chris laughs to himself and painfully nods at the truth.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I watch the way you interact.  
                        Hell, the way you walk.  Everyone 
                        really responds to you.     

                                 TOMPKINS
                        The streets here ain’t any 
                        different from Baghdad.  
                        Motherfuckers are like weeds.  One 
                        gets killed and two more pop up.  
                        It’s just here, they don’t use 
                        religion as their excuse.  These 
                        people got the anger of Ahab in 
                        them, and they’ll push you because 
                        they don’t give a fuck.  Treat 
                        them the way you’d want to be 
                        treated by them, and they’ll 
                        respect you.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        There’s the rub, huh?

                        little fucked up.  Because the 
                        kind of man that chooses to do 
                        what we do everyday has got to be 
                        a little crazy to begin with.

           They turn their attention to the window.  Michelle enters 
           the kitchen with Tabitha and hands her to Alicia.      

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I’m glad you guys came.

           INT. MECHANICS GARAGE - DAY

           Jeffery Allen and Lanier walk into a car garage.  Dozens 
           of toolboxes, oil drums, and rags lie about the room.

           A pair of legs stick out from under a white, tricked out, 
           1968 El Camino.  Jeffery reaches down and tugs on both 
           legs.  TOMMY SANDERS (20s) slides on a roller out from 
           under the car.  He’s tall and skinny and decorated with 
           ink.  He has eyeballs tattooed on his eyelids giving him 
           an even creepier presence.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Tommy Sanders.  You rang for me?

                        No you may not.  You’ve gotten 
                        more colorful.

                                 TOMMY
                        I quit using my veins and started 
                        using my brains.  It’s how I

                        No one knows for sure.  I’ve heard 
                        everything from Colombians mercs 
                        to a squad of badass Chinese Triad 
                        bitches.  I ain’t never seen 
                        anything like it.  And you know 
                        I’m plugged in.

           Jeffery motions Lanier towards the door.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Hold up, Detective Allen.  I’ve 
                        been picking up shifts down at The 
                        Foundation.  Last night these 
                        girls come in all fucked up and I 
                        overhear one of them talking shit 
                        about her boyfriend.  He’s a cock-
                        sucker this, a shady-prick that.  
                        She says he came home last Friday 
                        with over a hundred grand.  He 
                        gets high and she asks him how he 
                        got it and he makes some joke 
                        about robbing a bank.  Says he’s 
                        got a closet full of fake ID’s and 
                        shit.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        What’s this girl’s name?

           Tommy pulls out his wallet and hands a copy of Leah’s 
           number to Lanier.

                                 TOMMY
                        Leah something.  She’s a model.  
                        All I know about her is that she’s 
                        fucked just about anyone who’s 
                        ever snapped her picture.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        How do you know her boy’s not just 
                        some dealer?

                                 TOMMY
                        Because she asked me if I was 
                        holding anything I could sell.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Are you?

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 TOMMY
                        No.  I’m clean.  I told her I was 
                        getting some gear though.  Thought 
                        I might try and get a blow job or 
                        something out of it.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        I don’t know how you find your 
                        dick with those cartoons all over 
                        you. 

                                 LANIER
                        I’ll get her info.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        And get surveillance rolling.  
                        Let’s find out who her boyfriend 
                        is.  There’s always a sting of 
                        truth in a joke.
                                 (to Tommy)
                        Set up a deal with her and call 
                        me.  Until then, if you hear of 
                        anything-

                                 TOMMY
                        -My eyes are always open, boss.  I 
                        don’t sleep.

           Tommy blinks his eyes slowly, showing off the eyeball 
           tattoos on his eyelids.

           INT. HOLE IN THE WALL BAR, HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           Tompkins sits alone at the bar drinking a beer.  Two 
           other couples occupy bench booths.  Gabriel enters and 
           grabs a seat next to Tompkins.  The bartender arrives and 
           Gabriel points to Tompkins’s beer.

           Tompkins turns his stare to Gabriel, who looks like he 
           hasn’t slept or eaten in days.  

           The bartender drops off his drinks.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        What do you want?  You know we 
                        ain’t supposed to meet outside 
                        business.

                                 GABRIEL
                        I know.  This is business.

           Tompkins shakes his head disapprovingly.

                        I just want to talk to you for a 
                        minute.  Okay?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Talk.

                                 GABRIEL
                        I feel like things are getting way 
                        out of control.  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        I don’t give a fuck about your 
                        feelings.  You need to just chill 
                        the fuck out.  We’ve got this shit 
                        under control.

                                 GABRIEL
                        I’m not talking about robbing some 
                        bank, Terrell.  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        I know what you’re talking about.

                                 GABRIEL
                        We’re planning a murder, of our 
                        own for Christ’s sake.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Shut the fuck up!  

           Tompkins looks around the room to make sure no one heard.

                                 TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        What’s the matter with you?  Huh?  
                        Our own?

           Gabriel takes a long drink from his beer.  

                                 TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        When’s the last time you slept?

                                 GABRIEL
                        You guys all think I’m a big 
                        fucking joke.  No one listens to 
                        me unless I have a punch-line.  

           Tompkins takes a drink and gives his full attention.

                                 GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        When I shot that security guard in 
                        Van Nuys, the ground moved under 
                        my feet like it was breaking 
                        apart.

                        All the blood rushed to my head 
                        and everything burst inside me 
                        before she even hit the ground.  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        We all agreed to put that behind 
                        us a long time ago.

                                 GABRIEL
                        I didn’t!  I didn’t agree to that.  

           Tompkins peers around the room again and calmly rises.  
           Gabriel pulls him back down onto the stool.

                                 GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        You ever shot anyone.  Ever used 
                        your pistol in the line of duty?

           Tompkins snaps his arm away.  Gabriel holds up his index 
           finger and pulls on an imaginary trigger.

                                 GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        One gentle little squeeze can 
                        stand the world on its head.  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Then what are you worried about? 
                        It ain’t gonna be your finger.

                                 GABRIEL
                        This blood is on all our hands, 
                        just like that guard.  We’ll never 
                        get it off if we do this.  It’s 
                        gonna stain us forever.  I fucking 
                        know.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        You know shit.  

           Tompkins shoves his stool back and throws down some cash. 

                                 TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        This one’s on me.  You look like a 
                        tweaker.  You need to get yourself 
                        straightened out.

                                 GABRIEL
                        We don’t want to do this, Terrell.  
                        It’s written all over your face.

                                 TOMPKINS

           EXT. PAY PHONE, STREET, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Tompkins’s eyes comb the street as he dials a number and 
           waits.

                        It’s Terrell.  Just had a drink 
                        with Gabe.  He said he wanted to 
                        talk business but he ain’t acting 
                        right.  He’s tripping about the 
                        999.  I thought you should know.

           INT. LOBBY, W HOTEL, HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           Michael sits with a cell to his ear in a lush leather 
           chair.  Across from him sits an elegantly dressed Brett.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Alright.  I’ll work it out.  Do me 
                        a favor and keep this between us.  

           He hangs up the phone and slides it into his coat.  He 
           stares momentarily through Brett.  

                                 BRETT
                        Everything okay?

           Michael forces a smile.  

           INT. LAPD STATION, INDOOR FIRING RANGE - DAY

           Chris and several other members of GED stand in front of 
           their respective targets - pictures of bangers, thieves, 
           and terrorists.  A buzzer sounds and they quickly draw 
           pistols from their holsters and commence firing.

           The buzzer sounds again the pistols are holstered.  The 
           targets move down the lane towards the officers.  

           Tompkins walks in and examines Chris’s target, a picture 
           of Osama Bin Laden:  four rounds to the head, six to the 
           heart, and two into the paper target’s crotch.  Tompkins 
           points to the two at the crotch; Chris smiles and shrugs.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Grab a few of the guys and meet me 
                        in the briefing room.
           INT. LAPD STATION, GANG SQUAD HQ - DAY

           Tompkins, Chris, Smith, Gomez, and three other members of 
           GED huddle around a table staring at mug shots of 
           LAMICHAEL MCCOY (black, 25). 

                                 TOMPKINS
                        This is LaMichael ‘Midtown’ McCoy, 
                        twenty-five.  I got a call from a 
                        reliable CI this morning that said 
                        he’s connected to the Darious 
                        Irving drive-by last week.  This 
                        motherfucker’s hard-core.  His 
                        jacket bleeds violent offenses.  
                        He’s got four warrants out and 
                        this morning the dumb motherfucker 
                        showed up at his mama’s house.  

           Tompkins looks up to Chris.

                                 TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        You up to take lead on this?  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Does the Pope shit in the woods?

           EXT. LAMICHAEL MCCOY’S HOUSE, SOUTH CENTRAL NEIGHBORHOOD - 
           DAY

           Chris, Tompkins, and the rest move tactically down the 
           street from three unmarked GED vehicles.  Chris is in 
           sharp command of the group as they reach the home.  He 
           sends three officers down the side of the house towards 
           the back and motions Tompkins, Gomez, Smith to follow.

           He leads them over the chain link fence and into the 
           front yard.  Suddenly, glass from a window in the front 
           of the house shatters.  The curtain hanging behind it 
           spits in the air as rounds from an automatic rifle rip 
           through it, setting it ablaze.  

           The dirt and grass around Chris, Tompkins, and the other 
           officers’ feet shred apart as they sprint towards the 
           safety of the porch.  Tompkins stumbles, but is pulled up 
           by Chris who turns quickly around to help him.  Chris 
           calmly raises his pistol and returns fire as they reach 
           the front door.

           Chris motions Gomez forward to breach the door as the 
           rounds coming from inside move through the thin walls 
           towards them.  Gomez kicks the door off the hinges.
           INT. LAMICHAEL MCCOY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Chris is first in as they move through the living room 
           and down a hallway.  McCoy runs, shooting behind him as 
           he sprints into the master bedroom and slams the door.  

           Chris and Tompkins follow quickly.  Smith and Gomez move 
           methodically behind, ensuring the other rooms are clear.  

           Tompkins kicks open the door to the bedroom and trips 
           into the wall.  Chris moves in to find McCoy loading a 
           new magazine into his MAC 10.  McCoy looks up and meets 
           his eyes.  The two square off, frozen in an intense 
           pause.  

           Tompkins looks up, but his view of McCoy is obstructed.  
           He watches as Chris squeezes off three well aimed rounds.  

           EXT. LAMICHAEL MCCOY’S HOUSE, FRONT YARD - EVENING

           A large contingent of police officers and medical teams 
           move about the house.  Police barricades, tape, and 
           evidence flags are everywhere.  Neighborhood folks have 
           gathered outside the fence and watch curiously.

           Tompkins and Chris stand in the yard speaking with a 
           SUITED OFFICER.  Tompkins notices DeShaun Miller down the 
           street moving towards the crowd and excuses himself.  

           EMS push a gurney carrying McCoy’s body from the house. 
           Miller tries to fight his way through the crowd and the 
           officers expanding the perimeter.

                                 DESHAUN MILLER
                        Who is that!?  Who’d they kill!?  

           The gurney moves past Chris, who stares at the body as it 
           moves down the barricaded path towards the ambulance.  
           His eyes move toward the crowd and lock, yet again, with 
           the unnerving stare of Miller. 

           INT. IRISH PUB - NIGHT

           Chris, Tompkins, Gomez, Smith, and half a dozen other 
           officers from the GED sit at a long table drinking 
           pitchers of beer.  The mood is neither celebratory nor 
           somber.  After a day like today, they find each other’s 
           company is the easiest to tolerate.

           Tompkins and Chris sit at the end of the table talking 
           quietly.  Both are drunk, but not completely incoherent.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Those rounds were creeping right 
                        up your ass. 

                                 TOMPKINS
                        I’ve seen worse. I bet you thought 
                        these days were behind you.

           Chris laughs and shakes his head.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        You know, the first real fire-
                        fight I ever got into lasted just 
                        a bit longer than today.  I froze 
                        in my boots.  I could see 
                        everything happening in front of 
                        me and my brain’s talking but my 
                        body’s not responding.  Because 
                        running towards someone shooting 
                        at you goes against all your born 
                        instincts.  I don’t even remember 
                        hearing a single shot during the 
                        whole thing.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        You definitely heard that shit 
                        today.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I loved the war.  It was the 
                        happiest I’ve ever been.  My old 
                        battalion commander used to pass 
                        out a unit coin for every 
                        confirmed insurgent we killed.  
                        I’ve got a heavy box full of them 
                        at home.  We used to celebrate 
                        killing those motherfuckers.  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Of course you did, it was your 
                        job.  You did it well.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        But I think about that kid today 
                        and I don’t feel like celebrating.  
                        I certainly don’t feel sorry.  I 
                        just don’t feel a damn thing.  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        You’ve got the numbness.  Harness 
                        it.  Be thankful you have it.  
                        It’s your guard against all the 
                        shit out here.  

           Chris pushes back his chair and stands.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I don’t want to be numb.  Like you 
                        said, I want to feel good about 
                        what we do.  

           Tompkins watches Chris walk to the bathroom.  He rubs his 
           drunk, conflicted face and takes a long drink from his 
           beer as Michelle enters the pub.  She searches the bar 
           with her eyes before finally recognizing him.  

           Tompkins stands and holds out his hand to her.  She 
           ignores it and wraps her arms around him tightly.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Are you guys okay?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Yeah.  We’re good.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Where’s Chris?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Bathroom.  He’ll be right out.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Thanks for looking out for him.  

           Tompkins shakes his head and forces a smile.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        He don’t need looking after.  

           She nods to the table and smiles back.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Chris hasn’t had any sort of 
                        camaraderie like this in a long 
                        time.  He thrives on it.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        It’s a good group.

                                 MICHELLE
                        He really looks up to you.  I can 
                        tell because he rarely looks up to 
                        anyone.

           He nods to Chris arriving back from the bathroom.  Chris 
           puts his arms tightly around Michelle’s waist and kisses 
           her cheek.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to stay for another 
                        beer?

                        I want to see the kids.  Maybe 
                        another time.

           INT. MICHAEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Michael rests against the headboard of his bed.  Brett 
           lies next to him picking buds from a small bag of weed 
           and laying them onto a sheet of cigarette paper.  She is 
           naked under a silk robe that accentuates her soft curves.  
           Michael studies her body.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I believe I’m addicted to you.    
                        I’m always in control. Always.  
                        People normally do what I tell 
                        them, but when I lay here, all I 
                        want is to satisfy you.  It’s 
                        unfamiliar to me.  I can’t explain 
                        it.    

           She smiles and licks the joint, rolling it tight. 

                                 BRETT
                        Is that why you’ve never married.  

           She hands him the joint as she rolls off the bed.  He 
           reaches to the night stand for a zippo.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.  I just never felt like I had 
                        the time.  And I hate 
                        complications.

           He watches her as she laughs and rolls out of bed.

                                 BRETT
                        That’s a horrible reason.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why?  Do you want to marry me?

                                 BRETT
                        You keep indulging me like you do 
                        and I just may.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I enjoy pleasing you.  I’m happy 
                        to do it.

           Michael watches her disrobe and dress.

                                 BRETT
                        No.  Really?  Where?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Paris.

                                 BRETT
                        I love Paris.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why don’t you come with me?  

                                 BRETT
                        I can’t just move away with you.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m serious.  I’ve got more than 
                        enough put away for the two of us.  
                        You won’t have to work.

                                 BRETT
                        It’s impossible.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m not asking you to love me.

                                 BRETT
                        Neither do my other clients when 
                        they ask me the same thing.  

           She grabs his wallet from atop the dresser and crawls 
           onto the bed towards him.  

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        If you didn’t have to pay, you 
                        wouldn’t want me anymore.  Then 
                        where would I be?  You’re a good 
                        man, Mike.  You could have anyone.   

           He pulls out a stack of one-hundred dollar bills and 
           hands it to her. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        It’s too much.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m happy to do it.

           She takes the cash and leans into him.  She grabs him by 
           the back of the neck and kisses him slow and deep.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

           He watches as she crawls from the bed, grabs her purse, 
           and makes her way towards the door. 

           INT. BICYCLE SHOP - NIGHT

           Jeffery Allen sneaks into the room quietly behind Lanier, 
           and Payton, who lie behind cameras and surveillance gear 
           in the back of dark bicycle shop.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        What are you cock-smokers looking 
                        at?

           With their optics they look through the store, across the 
           street, and into the window of a wine bar at Gabriel and 
           Leah who talk quietly at a table.  

           Leah cries and slides Gabriel’s hands towards her.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m assuming that’s the boyfriend?

                                 PAYTON
                        That’d be my first guess.

                                 LANIER
                        He don’t look like a photographer.

           Payton takes pictures of them.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Let’s get on it.  I want to know 
                        his name, where he shits, where he 
                        sleeps.  I want to know everything 
                        about him.  Keep a tail on both.  
                        Hopefully they’ll stay together.  

           Jeffery watches Leah lean over the table to kiss a 
           despondent Gabriel.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s a good looking woman.  If 
                        you’re lucky, maybe you’ll catch 
                        some good make-up fucking.

           Jeffery pats them both on the shoulder and leaves.
           INT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S CAR - NIGHT

           Jeffery Allen drives through Hollywood glancing at the 
           dirty streets.  The bright lights of Los Angeles shine on 
           his hood and reflect off his windshield.  He pulls out a 
           flask and takes a long drink.

           INT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jeffery Allen pours himself a fresh glass of Scotch.

           He stumbles through his living room and falls into an old 
           couch.  He stares at a picture of a woman framed on the 
           table beside him (it’s presumably his dead wife, Emily).

           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A cell phone on the bedside table next to Chris rings.  
           He jumps with a startle before picking it up.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN

           A clock on the wall reads 1:45 am.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        I didn’t realize the time.  Sorry.

                        It’s okay.  What’s the matter?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Nothing.  I just wanted to call 
                        and tell you how proud I am of 
                        you.  For what you did today.

           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Chris takes a deep breath.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I’m not sure there’s anything to

                        I wouldn’t worry over it.

                        Can we talk about this in the 
                        morning?

           Jeffery’s eyes water, but don’t move from the picture on 
           the table.  He opens his mouth, but no words come out.  

           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, BEDROOM

                                 CHRIS ALLEN 
                        Thanks for the call.  Get some 
                        sleep, Uncle Jeff.

           Chris hangs up the phone and looks down at Michelle.

                                 MICHELLE
                        How’s Uncle Jeff?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        He’s lonely.

           EXT. PARK BENCH, DOWNTOWN, LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Lustick sits on a bench in a park overlooking downtown.  
           He’s reads an Israeli newspaper and eats shelled peanuts 
           whole.  Michael approaches the bench with a cup of 
           coffee, looking for Shabot and Feldman or anyone who may 
           be watching before taking a seat next to Lustick.

                                 LUSTICK
                        How are the preparations coming?

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’re on track.

                        This job started on a need to

                        that protocol.  

           He offers Michael some peanuts before folding up the bag.  
           He pulls out hand wipe from his pocket, tears it open, 
           and cleans his fingers.

                                 LUSTICK (CONT’D)
                        The truck arrives tonight.  The 
                        package is only here for twenty-
                        four hours and then it ships.

                        I want your word this squares us.

                        We meet one more time after this.  
                        How that goes is up to you, my

           Michael frowns and walks off in the direction he came.

           INT. MICHAEL’S BMW - DAY

           Michael drives cautiously down the freeway when one of 
           three cell phones he’s carrying rings.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah.

           INT. MOM AND POP’S COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Welch stands beside the cash register speaking quietly 
           into a land line phone on the counter.  A married, middle-
           aged couple tend to their customers.  The woman looks 
           over at him and the badge swinging around his neck.  She 
           sneaks a flirtatious smile.    

                                 WELCH
                        It’s me.  Bad news.  Gabriel’s

                        people on him right now.

                        Not at the moment, but I’m sure 
                        the check’s in the mail.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll handle it.  We prep tonight.  
                        Tell the others.

           Michael hangs up the phone and abruptly pulls off the 
           highway and parks the car on a random street.  He breaks 
           the phone in half and tosses it into a trash can.  He 
           looks around and takes a deep, deciding breath.

           INT. LAPD INTERNAL AFFAIRS CONFERENCE ROOM, - DAY

           Chris sits in a chair facing a panel of two unseen IA 
           DETECTIVES.  Dressed in civilian clothes, his sharp blue 
           eyes move around the panel.  Tompkins stands behind Chris 
           in the back of the room leaning against the wall.

                                 IA DETECTIVE #1 (O.S.)
                        In light of the overwhelming 
                        evidence and testimony by Officer 
                        Tompkins detailing your exemplary 
                        actions, I see no reason for you 
                        to concern yourself any further.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        That’s great news.  When can I 
                        expect a formal decision?

                                 IA DETECTIVE #2 (O.S.)
                        There will be a ceremonious 
                        investigation to appease the paper 
                        chaser, but you’ll have a formal 
                        decision in a couple of weeks.

                                 IA DETECTIVE #1
                        If I were you, I’d just put it all 
                        behind me starting now.  You did

                        piece of shit.

           Chris stares at them a beat, and nods to the officers.

                        Thanks for everything, Terrell.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        No problem.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        The plan is you go home and spend 
                        the rest of the day with your 
                        family.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        It’s no problem.  I’m good to go.

                        Superfly.  And neither are you.

           Chris eyes Tompkins with a hint of disappointment.

                                 TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        What?  I got a dick on my

           Tompkins watches him go for a moment, takes a deep 
           breath, and moves the badge hanging from his neck and 
           hides it under his shirt.

           INT. SUBWAY HUB, DOWNTOWN, LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Michael sits on an empty bench watching the dark tunnel 
           get brighter as a train approaches.  It stops and Gabriel 
           steps out.  Michael walks towards him and they meet next 
           to some vending machines in the middle.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Positive you weren’t followed.

                        Nothing.

           Michael grabs him forcefully by the neck and lunges him 
           into a vending machine.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What did you tell her!?

                        You’re high all the time.  You 
                        wouldn’t remember if you did.  I 
                        saw this coming.  I didn’t stop it 
                        when I should’ve.  

           Michael looks around to make sure no is watching them.

                        Okay.  Whatever you say.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I want you to drive around until 
                        they get the tail back on you, and 
                        then you lead them out of town.  
                        Drive to Vegas.  Hold up there 
                        until I come for you.

           Gabriel wipes his eyes shamefully.

                                 GABRIEL
                        You won’t do anything to Leah, 
                        right?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Do you trust me?

           Gabriel nods.

                                 GABRIEL
                        I’m sorry, Mike.

           Michael offers a brotherly nod before he takes off 
           towards the exit, leaving Gabriel standing there alone.

           EXT. COFFEE STOP, DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Jeffery garnishes his coffee as Ling and Payton drive up.  
           He walks over to meet them in the parking lot.  

                                 LANIER
                        We lost him for a few hours.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        What?

                                 PAYTON
                        He ducked into the subway.  He 
                        made three random connections and 
                        we lost him on the fourth.  But we 
                        just picked him back up about 
                        twenty minutes ago.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Where is he now?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        So we don’t know who he saw or 
                        spoke with for the better part of 
                        the morning.

                                 LANIER
                        And his movement patterns indicate 
                        he’s aware we’re on him.

           Payton’s phone rings.  He hands it to Jeffery.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN

           INT. LAPD, SPECIAL UNIT INVESTIGATIONS HQ - DAY

           Ling sits at her desks working.

                                 LING
                        His full name is Gabriel Reese 
                        Martin.  Twenty-nine years old.  
                        He served three years with the 
                        LAPD and racked up a slew of 
                        reprimands before finally getting 
                        dismissed for substance abuse.  No 
                        arrests since.  Not even a history 
                        of employment.

                        If he knows he has a tail and 
                        deliberately burns us, he’s got 
                        something going.  Find out who his 
                        old partners were.  See if they 
                        can shed some light if they’re not 
                        crooked themselves.

           He hangs up the phone and hands it back to Payton.

                        Are we putting all our eggs in one 
                        basket here, Jeff?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        I’ve seen hundreds of cases go 
                        unsolved over the years because 
                        detectives dismissed their 
                        instincts when they should’ve 
                        followed them.  So we’ll just call 
                        it intuition.

                                 LANIER
                        Or desperation.

           Jeffery glances coldly at Lanier.

           INT. GABRIEL’S HOUSE, LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

           Gabriel sits on his couch in the dark living room.  On 
           the coffee table rests half a bottle of bourbon, some 
           cocaine, and cigarettes.  A packed bag sits beside the 
           table.  Sweat lines his scalp and dots his tee shirt.  
           His knees shake as he contemplates his next move.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Work areas have been set up around the pool table.  
           Supplies and gear are littered around the room.   

           Michael and Rodriguez build an explosive device, 
           carefully handling the material seen earlier.  They roll 
           the device and place it into a gym bag.  

           Welch inspects the radio gear.  He changes out the 
           batteries and conducts radio checks with Tompkins.  He 
           arranges all of it tactically on a load bearing vest.

           Tompkins inspects a table full of firearms and rigs a 
           handful of smoke grenades to a vest.   

           The four men walk through the interior model discussing 
           last minute plans.  They load their gear into a long, 
           white van parked just inside the warehouse door.  

           INT. MICHAEL’S BMW, STREETS - NIGHT

           Michael drives closely behind another sedan.  Tompkins 
           sits quietly in the passenger seat staring out the 
           window.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The sedan in front of them pulls into an empty lot and 
           parks.  Welch and Rodriguez get out and jump in the BMW.  

           INT. MICHAEL’S BMW, STREET, NEAR INDUSTRIAL VILLAGE - 
           NIGHT

           A heavy fog thickens the air, muffling sounds of the 
           neighborhood, adding a soft filter to the glow of lights. 
           Michael and the others stare down the street at the DHS 
           building.  A large, unmarked truck arrives and backs up 
           into a loading dock. 

           Tompkins looks at his watch and rubs his eyes.  

                                 WELCH
                        Terrell?

           Tompkins turns around slowly.  Welch studies his face for 
           a moment before he turns back.  Rodriguez and Michael 
           lock eyes in the rearview.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        It’s a calm night.

           Michael starts the car, rolling up his window as they 
           drive away.

           INT. GABRIEL’S CAR - NIGHT

           The window of Gabriel’s car rises to a crack as he lights 
           a cigarette.  The flame illuminates up his tense, pulled 
           face.  He rubs his eyes and shakes his head violently, 
           doing his best to focus and remain coherent.  He looks 
           into his rearview mirror searching for his tail.

           INT. UNMARKED CRUISER - NIGHT

           Payton drives a few cars behind Gabriel.  Bright ashes 
           from Gabriel’s cigarette flicker from his window.

           INT. LAPD CHOPPER, OVERHEAD - NIGHT

           Ling sits in the passenger seat of the cockpit staring 
           down at the Interstate.  She wears a radio headset.

                                 LING
                                 (into microphone)
                        We’ve got air and ground mobile 
                        units on him.  
           INT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S CAR - NIGHT

           Jeffery sits in his car watching an empty store parking 
           lot.  Smoke rises from the driver’s side window of a 
           tricked out El Camino.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                                 (into radio)
                        Where’s he headed?

                                 LING (O.S.)
                        East on the ten, but he’s been 
                        driving in circles for an hour.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        He’s throwing us off scent.  He 
                        wants us to tail him.  I want to 
                        know the second he stops.  And 
                        don’t lose him, Ling.

           Jeffery hangs up the microphone as a white Lexus SUV 
           pulls into the parking lot.

           EXT. EMPTY STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Tommy waves from his El Camino and smiles at Leah as she 
           pulls her vehicle next to his.  She lowers her window and 
           smiles.  Her hair is up and her face is clean of make-up.  

                                 TOMMY
                        Hey, gorgeous.

                                 LEAH
                        I’m glad you called.  I was 
                        running out of options.

                                 TOMMY
                        Damn.  You’re even prettier 
                        without all them tacky bar lights.  
                        They’re supposed to make everybody 
                        look beautiful.

           She flashes a practiced smile and rolls her eyes.

           INT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S CAR - NIGHT

           Jeffery watches the scene, growing impatient by the 
           second.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                                 (to himself)
                        He’s trying to fuck her...the 
                        shithead.  Just sell her the bag!
           EXT. EMPTY STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Tommy reaches inside his coat pocket and pulls out a zip 
           lock baggy.  He holds it outside the window and shakes 
           it.

                                 TOMMY
                        Ta-dah.  I don’t live too far from 
                        here.  We can get high at my 
                        place, watch them Kardashian 
                        bitches act a fool or something.

                                 LEAH
                        Sorry.  I can’t.  I’m meeting some 
                        people.  That’s a quarter, right?

           She reaches into her purse and pulls out some folded 
           cash.  She reaches out for the bag, money in hand.

           INT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S CAR - NIGHT

           Jeffery holds a wireless radio up to his mouth.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Let’s go.

           EXT. EMPTY STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Tommy grabs hold of her wrist as she tries to pull away 
           with the bag.

                                 TOMMY
                        You sure?  We can negotiate the  
                        currency.  Know what I’m saying?

           Leah’s eyes widen to the sound of tires screeching as 
           Jeffery flies over the curb of the parking lot, pulling 
           his cruiser within a few feet of their vehicles.  Lanier 
           arrives simultaneously from the other direction.

           Leah drops the money and the bag and immediately raises 
           her hands.  Jeffery and Lanier jump from their cruisers 
           with pistols and badges drawn.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck, bitch!  You set me 
                        up?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Both of you, out of the cars 
                        slowly.  Hands above your head.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tommy beats them to the punch.  He exaggerates all of his 
           movements and moans to sell the scene.  Lanier grabs him 
           by the wrists and slams him down hard onto the hood. 

                                 TOMMY
                        I know my fucking rights, man.  I 
                        want my phone call.  

           Lanier cuffs and ushers him to the back of his cruiser as 
           Tommy wiggles and curses.

                                 LANIER
                        A bit much, don’t you think?

           Lanier slams the door as Tommy slings muffled insults.  

           Jeffery cuffs Leah whose eyes have filled with tears.  He 
           waves the cash and bag of dope in front of her face.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        You’re way to pretty to be messing  
                        with this, Leah.

           Her face goes white at the sound of her name.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        This can go two ways for you.  
                        Cooperate by answering every 
                        question I ask you thoroughly, or 
                        we arrest you and your publicist 
                        announces you’re going into rehab 
                        earlier than she’d planned.  

                                 LEAH
                        The first one.  Whatever you want 
                        to know.  I swear to God.

           Jeffery motions for Lanier to drive Tommy away.  Tommy 
           smiles at Jeffery, obviously very pleased with himself.

           INT. GABRIEL’S CAR - NIGHT

           Gabriel drives through a neighborhood searching the 
           mailboxes for addresses.  He slows as he finds the one 
           he’s looking for and parks directly across the street.  

           He watches as Payton drives past him slowly and turns at 
           the next intersection.
           EXT. EMPTY STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Jeffery dials his cell phone as Leah drives away.  He 
           spits onto the windshield of Tommy’s El Camino and toys 
           with the hood ornament.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                                 (into his cell phone)
                        It’s me.  Leah says Gabriel has 
                        tons of suspicious shit in his 
                        house and she knows where he hides 
                        his cash.  Start the warrant and 
                        we’ll get in there to see if we

                        that match up with any of the 
                        bank’s.  Gabriel runs with his 
                        half-brother, Michael Laird.  She 
                        says he’s pretty hard-core and 
                        something he’s into has our boy 
                        spooked.

           Lanier sits at the desk writing down Jeffery’s orders.  
           Tommy sits in a chair next to his desk being a nuisance.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (O.S.)
                        The last time she saw Michael was 
                        a few days ago.  Let’s get eyes on 
                        him as soon as you get an address.  

                                 LANIER
                        Got it.  Ling’s been trying to get 
                        a hold of you.  Gabriel stopped in  
                        a neighborhood in Highland Park.  
                        He’s been sitting in his car for 
                        the last half hour in front of 
                        some house.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Highland Park. What’s the address?

                                 LANIER
                        806 Winflow Drive.

           Jeffery races towards his car, his voice stressed with 
           urgency.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Get Payton and whoever you can.  
                        Apprehend Gabriel right now!

                        Okay...why?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Just do it!  

           Jeffery speeds away as fast as he the cruiser will allow,  
           searching for Chris’s number on his phone.   

           The ornament on Tommy’s El Camino hangs from the hood, 
           broken.

           EXT. GABRIEL’S CAR - NIGHT

           Gabriel slowly gets out of his car.  He stares down the 
           street and up into the sky.  The faint sound of a 
           helicopter is heard.

           He crosses the street and stands in the front lawn of 
           Chris Allen’s house.  Through a window he watches as 
           Michelle and Chris cook together in the kitchen.

           He takes a couple of hesitant steps forward and stops.  
           His focus is pulled from the window to distant headlights 
           speeding his way.  Payton’s car reappears at the 
           intersection.  

           Gabriel runs back into the street towards another house, 
           jumps the fence into the backyard, and disappears into 
           the dark.

           INT. LAPD CHOPPER, OVERHEAD - NIGHT

           Ling watches Gabriel disappear under a large area of 
           trees.  The helicopter flies around the area waiting for 
           him to reappear, but he is gone.

           EXT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, FRONT YARD - NIGHT

           Jeffery Allen arrives moments later.  Chris and Michelle 
           stand in the front yard speaking with Payton.  Across the 
           street from them, several officers search Gabriel’s car.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        You guys okay?

           Chris and Michelle are confused about the situation, but 
           remain in a jovial mood.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        We’re fine.

                        Any luck?

                                 PAYTON
                        He’s gone.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Son of a bitch!

           He gives Payton a stone cold look.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                                 (to Michelle)
                        Would you mind grabbing Uncle Jeff 
                        some water?  

           Michelle smiles at Jeffery and moves towards the house.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Who is this guy?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Gabriel Martin.  Does that name 
                        ring a bell?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Never heard that name in my life.  
                        Is he dangerous?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Very.  He was a cop and now I 
                        think he’s a part of the crew 
                        we’re investigating.

                                 PAYTON
                        Can you think of any reason why 
                        he’d come here?

           Chris shakes his head.

                                 PAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Have any enemies? 

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        None that don’t end with the name 
                        Abdullah or Mohammed. 

           Jeffery gives Payton a look to which he excuses himself.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Chris, seriously, if you’re in 
                        some kind of trouble, tell me now 
                        and we’ll figure it out together.

                        Come on, Uncle Jeff.  The guy went 
                        to the wrong address.  He was 
                        looking for someone else, saw us 
                        in the window, and freaked when he 
                        heard your guys coming.  

           Jeffery looks hard at Chris.  Michelle reappears at the 
           door and walks towards them with a glass of ice water.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        When I heard your address on the 
                        net, I...I don’t know what I’d do.

           He takes the water from Michelle who puts an arm around 
           his waist.  Jeffery’s phone rings.  He excuses himself 
           and walks to the edge of the yard.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                                 (into phone)

           INT. LAPD, SPECIAL UNIT INVESTIGATIONS HQ - NIGHT

           Lanier sits in the same spot as before.  A hot cup of 
           coffee steams in front of him.  Tommy stands at a dry 
           erase board drawing a cartoon picture of naked woman.

                                 LANIER
                        Michael Laird.  Thirty-seven years 
                        old.  Did twenty-eight months for 
                        armed robbery in the nineties, but 
                        no other convictions.  But listen, 
                        he was set to be indicted in a 
                        grand jury probe of Richard 
                        Lustick in a big federal arms 
                        smuggling and laundering 
                        investigation a few years ago.

                        Lustick, from the Bay Area?

                        That’s the one.  The case was 
                        dropped after cutbacks and for 
                        lack of evidence.  Nothing sticks 
                        on this guy, but word around the 
                        fire is Lustick hasn’t slowed 
                        much.

                        And, Jeffery...he’s in town.  

           Jeffery takes a drink and holds up the glass of ice water 
           to a light.  Tiny sediments float at the top.  A piece of 
           ice cracks and shifts the balance of cubes.

           Lanier peers at Tommy and rolls his eyes.

                        The captain wants Lustick.  He’s 
                        already detailed us a few more 
                        bodies.  We’ll get on top of it.

           Lanier hangs up and turns to Tommy.

                                 LANIER
                        How does one like yourself become 
                        such a piece of shit?  

           Tommy points to the picture he’s been drawing.

                        What?  You don’t like it?

           EXT. LAPD CHOPPER, OVERHEAD - NIGHT

           Ling looks down on the scene.  Jeffery follows Chris and 
           Michelle inside the house.  Officers guide a tow truck 
           towards Gabriel’s car.  Payton drives away in his 
           cruiser.  The helicopter descends from the dark sky, 
           sedately fading into the city lights below.

           Welch lifts open the warehouse door.  He jumps into the

           Chris and Michelle lie in bed with Tabitha in between 
           them.  Chris tickles her tummy and kisses her hands.  He 
           picks her up and lowers her to his face. 

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        She’d been seeing the manager at a 
                        bar she waitressed at and he 
                        caught wind she’d been turning 
                        some of her regulars...and she 
                        probably was.  She was like that. 
                        Regardless, she didn’t deserve the 
                        kind of beating he gave her.

           INT. TOMPKIN’S HOUSE, BATHROOM - MORNING

           Hot water runs in the shower behind Tompkins, who stands 
           in front of the mirror.  Alicia walks in and smiles 
           warmly at him.  She disrobes and steps into the shower as 
           heavy steam clouds the mirror, slowly fogging away his 
           reflection.  

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        So I waited until she was asleep 
                        and couldn’t talk me out of it and 
                        I went over to the bar.  I broke 
                        in through a window and found him 
                        passed out in the office.    

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Gabriel lies naked in the middle of the bed next to a 
           tray of cocaine and a glass pipe.  Besides the cherry of 
           a cigarette resting between his lips, small slits between 
           the curtains steal the only light.

           His red eyes glow as he inhales the tobacco closer to the 
           filter.  A tall trail of ash sitting above the cherry 
           breaks and spills onto his chest as he sits up.  

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        I woke him up with some scalding 
                        water and he confessed.  He said 
                        he did it because he loved her and 
                        couldn’t bear the thought of her 
                        arching her back under someone 
                        else for money.  
           INT.  RESTAURANT, NORTH HOLLYWOOD - MORNING

           Rodriguez sits across the table from Michael listening to 
           his story over coffee, his badge dangling from his neck.

                                 MICHAEL
                        He begged forgiveness and swore 
                        he’d never do it again, but I’d 
                        decided.  I’d already atoned for 
                        it in my soul before I even set my 
                        mind to do it.  I put my gun to 
                        his head and made him wash down a 
                        pill box of Xanax with a bottle of 
                        vodka.  He’d throw up and I’d make 
                        him pick the pills out and swallow 
                        them again.  

           The front door to the restaurant swings open.  Welch 
           finds them instantly and joins them at the table.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        After a while he stopped crying 
                        about the things he never got to 
                        do and just fell asleep.  I spent 
                        the better part of the morning 
                        watching him die without a single, 
                        resistant notion to save him.  
                        That was the first time I’d ever 
                        killed anyone.  And I never 
                        thought at any point during that 
                        morning, nor any morning since, 
                        that the ends didn’t justify the 
                        means.  

           Michael sips his coffee and stares at Rodriguez’s badge.  

                                 WELCH
                        Gabriel’s gone, Mike.  
                        Surveillance lost him last night.  

           Michael nods as if he expected the news.

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        They’re on Lustick now, and 
                        they’re looking for you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        They’ll be looking for a long time 
                        after today.
           INT. LAPD, SPECIAL UNIT INVESTIGATIONS HQ - MORNING

           Jeffery Allen enters the office looking sleepless and 
           haggard.  Ling, Lanier, Payton, and two NEW DETECTIVES 
           sit around their desks making small talk.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Have we found Gabriel Martin yet?

                                 LING
                        No, sir.  Still looking.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        What about Michael Laird?

                                 LANIER
                        Patrol went by his house.  Besides 
                        a few pieces of furniture, it’s 
                        empty.  But I did get confirmation 
                        that he signed for a UPS package 
                        at his residence yesterday.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        And Lustick?

                                 PAYTON
                        He’s at the Thompson Hotel under 
                        his own name.  

           Jeffery looks them over for a moment.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        So what the hell are you all 
                        standing around for?  Do you not 
                        feel it?  Something big is about 
                        to happen and all I’m hearing is a 
                        bunch of ‘I don’t knows!’  Get 
                        proactive and find these people!  
                        And get me something solid for 
                        fuck’s sake!

           Jeffery moves past them into his office and slams the 
           door.  The others look at one another with frustration.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Gabriel walks down a sidewalk staring at parked cars.  He 
           looks around to ensure no one is watching and jimmies 
           open a Dodge Ram.  He quickly hot wires the engine.
           INT. LAPD STATION, GANG SQUAD HQ - DAY

           Chris walks into the squad room and garners some 
           handshakes and is the butt of a few jokes as he makes his 
           way through the room.  Tompkins watches him for a moment 
           before he puts on his vest and approaches Chris.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        I’ve got to roll to meet a CI.  
                        I’ll check in with you later.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Give me a second to grab my gear.  
                        I’ll come along.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Nah.  Stay here.  Take another day 
                        and chill.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Fuck that.  Don’t baby me, man.  
                        Big boy rules, right?

           Tompkins takes a beat to look him over.  

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Suit yourself.  

           INT. CROWN VICTORIA - DAY

           South Central Los Angeles is alive with crime and pain.  
           Tompkins searches the faces of the people they pass, as 
           if he’s waiting for them to point and scream, ‘Murderer!’  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        You okay?

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Yeah.  Got some shit on my mind.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Who’s the CI?

           Tompkins fumbles for an answer.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        A pusher named Corey Dubose.  He 
                        claims the Center Park Bloods.  He 
                        normally calls me up when he hears 
                        the Crips are moving shit. 

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        You trust him?

           CONTINUED:

                                 TOMPKINS
                        About as far as I can throw him.  
                        But he’s usually right.

           Chris pulls out his Glock, inspects the magazine, reloads 
           the pistol and puts it back into his holster.  Tompkins 
           watches him from the corner of his eyes.  

           INT. VAN - DAY

           The van is parked inside Industrial Village, backed into 
           a corner spot thirty meters from the front of the DHS 
           building.  Welch, Rodriguez, and Michael sit in the back 
           of the van monitoring the police radio, staring through 
           the black windows.  Except for their balaclavas, they are 
           geared up and ready to go.  

           EXT. PROJECTS - DAY

           Tompkins parks the Crown Victoria a block down the street 
           from a condemned apartment building.  The glass in the 
           windows is either completely gone or shattered.  The 
           doors hang on hinges and the plastered stucco walls are 
           cracked and peeling and littered with graffiti.  806 
           Washington is spray painted over the front entrance.  

           Tompkins and Chris approach the building from a sidewalk 
           running in front of the structure.

                                 TOMPKINS
                        Go in through the back door and 
                        clear out any squatters.  I’ll 
                        meet you on the second floor.

           Chris jogs towards the back as Tompkins slides through 
           the decrepit front door.  His feet crunch broken glass.

           INT. PROJECTS - DAY

           Chris draws his pistol and walks cautiously down the 
           hallway checking out empty rooms.  

           Tompkins stands in front of a broken mirror in an empty 
           bathroom on the other side of the building.  He tries to 
           calm himself.  His lips and hands shake.

           DeShaun Miller runs across an adjacent lot and sneaks in 
           through a window of the building.  He stops to listen as 
           he pulls a chrome plated .357 revolver from his belt.  

           Tompkins pulls the glock from his holster, pushes the 
           safety device to fire, and moves into the hallway.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Chris moves into a wide, dark corridor.  In the shadows, 
           a dark figure exits an apartment and falls in behind him, 
           moving slow and quiet.  The figure is distorted in the 
           darkness; it’s unclear whether it’s Tompkins or Miller.  
           The arm of the figure raises a pistol towards Chris.

           The eerie quiet is broken as Gabriel jumps into the 
           hallway directly in front of Chris, surprising him.  

                                 GABRIEL
                        Run.

           Chris follows Gabriel’s focused eyes and turns to find 
           the figure running towards them out of the darkness; it’s 
           Miller, gun held out firing.  The flames from the end of 
           the barrel light his face as he races towards them.

           Chris jumps into the room Gabriel just appeared from.  
           Gabriel pulls a pistol from his belt, but is hit by two 
           rounds fired from Miller and drops to the ground.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Tompkins!  Tompkins!

           Miller runs out of bullets before he reaches Chris.  He 
           turns and runs as Chris crawls around the corner and 
           returns a few poorly aimed shots at Miller before he 
           disappears.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Tompkins!  Hurry the fuck up!

           Chris crawls across the hallway to Gabriel, who bleeds 
           profusely from the neck and leg.  He tries to warn Chris, 
           but cannot make out the words.  His body shakes and his 
           eyes bulge as Chris tries to apply pressure to his neck 
           to stop the bleeding.

           Tompkins appears in the hallway running towards them, 
           pistol at the low ready.  He stops a few meters from 
           Chris and is frozen by the sight of Gabriel.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        DeShaun Miller!  He came out of 
                        nowhere and fired on us.  I don’t 
                        know who the fuck this guy is.

           Tompkins stares at the pistol still gripped tightly in 
           Gabriel’s hand.  Chris is focused on Gabriel’s neck.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Miller took off back down the 
                        hallway.  Call it in.  This guy’s 
                        fucking dying.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Chris turns his head to Tompkins, whose eyes moves from 
           Gabriel’s to his.  Tompkins’s pistol aimed between them.

           Chris looks down and sees the gun in Gabriel’s hand.  He 
           removes his hands from the fleshy neck and slides himself 
           back a foot.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Ter-

           Gabriel raises his pistol and fires simultaneously with 
           Tompkins.  Gabriel is hit in the chest and killed.  
           Tompkins is hit in the hip and the side of the head.  

           Chris jumps at the sound of the gunshots echoing down the 
           corridor.  Tompkins leans into the wall and drops to the 
           ground unconscious.

           Chris sits momentarily paralyzed by the scene.  He looks 
           down and checks himself for blood.  He jumps over 
           Gabriel’s body and pulls the gun from his dead fingers 
           and slides over to Tompkins.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Terrell!  Terrell!  

           He checks his neck for a pulse before he finally reaches 
           for the radio attached to his vest.  He takes a deep, 
           panicked breath.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)

           INT. VAN - DAY

           Welch, Rodriguez, and Michael’s eyes turn towards the 
           radio as a distress signal beeps through the speakers for 
           a couple of seconds.

                        an inner and outer perimeter.

           The radio comes alive with replies from responding 
           officers moving towards the call.

           back door and they run out towards the DHS building.   

           INT. LAPD, SPECIAL UNIT INVESTIGATIONS HQ - DAY

           Lanier storms by the rest of the team in full sprint.  He 
           reaches Jeffery Allen’s office out of breath.

                                 LANIER
                        Jeff.  Dispatch just received a

                        It’s Chris.

           Jeffery jumps from his seat and fumbles to get his coat, 
           gun, badge, and shoes on.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        I want everyone.

           Lanier runs out of the room to gather the others.  
           Jeffery sprints out of the office seconds later.

           INT. DHS BUILDING - DAY

           * All dialogue spoken by Michael, Welch, and Rodriguez 
           will be spoken in Spanish unless otherwise specified.

           Michael, Welch, and Rodriguez quickly enter the building, 
           their assault rifles, equipped with suppressors, at the 
           low ready.  Two TSA GUARDS (man and woman) sit inside the 
           door working the x-ray belt and metal detector station.  
           They immediately stand and raise their arms in surrender.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Rodriguez removes their weapons and zip ties their arms 
           behind their backs.  Michael zip ties the front door 
           shut.

           The three move down a hallway, pushing the security 
           guards as they go, until they reach a glass covered 
           atrium, with a fountain and lounge area in the middle.  
           One side of the atrium is lined with deep offices, and 
           the other a long courtesy desk managed by another guard.  
           At the far side of the room rests the door to the vault.

           Two more TSA guards chat with one another next to the 
           vault door until they spot the crew moving towards them.  
           One of the guards reaches for his pistol.  Rodriguez 
           fires on them, dropping both with two perfectly aimed 
           shots to the chest.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Keep moving!

           The last security guard triggers the alarm before Michael 
           drags him over the security desk.  He flex cuffs his arms 
           like the others, and grabs a set of keys and a door fob 
           hanging on a d-ring from his belt loop.  

           Michael pushes the three guards into the fountain.  Welch 
           and Rodriguez drag the two dead in with them.  Workers 
           come out of their offices to check out the commotion.  

           INT. JEFFERY’S CAR - DAY

           Jeffery and Lanier listen to the radio buzzing with nine-
           nine-nine chatter as Jeffery speeds through traffic.  
           Ling, Payton, and two other officers from the detail 
           follow closely behind them.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Who made the call?  Chris or 
                        Tompkins.

                                 LANIER
                        I’m not sure.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        So we don’t know for sure if Chris 
                        is down?

                                 LANIER
                        I haven’t heard one way or the 
                        other.
           EXT. PROJECTS - DAY

           Chris lifts Tompkins over his shoulder and carries him 
           from the building.  He lays him down gently as possible.  
           Blood has spilled all over Chris from his wounds.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        What the fuck is going on, 
                        Terrell?

           He pulls away Tompkins’s vest and tears off his shirt to 
           apply a field dressing to the wound at his waist.  

           The sounds of emergency units and police sirens emerge 
           from the quiet.  The sound of a helicopter arrives 
           quickly and Chris looks up and waves.

           INT. LAPD CHOPPER, OVERHEAD - DAY

           A SINGLE PILOT looks down on Chris from the sky and 
           affirms his location into the radio.  

           From his view we see well beyond the projects.  In all 
           directions, as far as can be seen from the bird, flashing 
           lights from dozens and dozens of police and emergency 
           units speed through the streets towards Chris and 
           Tompkins. 

           INT. DHS BUILDING - DAY

           Welch and Rodriguez pull workers from their offices into 
           the atrium, where Michael organizes them into a tight 
           huddle around the fountain, on their knees, facing 
           towards the center.  The water has turned red from the 
           blood leaking out of the dead bodies. 

           Once everyone is out, Welch and Rodriguez zip-tie the 
           office doors closed. 

           INT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S CAR - DAY

           Lanier holds tight to his seat as Jeffery daringly 
           maneuvers the car through traffic.  The second radio in 
           the car beeps, followed by a new dispatcher.

                                 DISPATCH (O.S.)
                        I need a unit for a 2-11 Adam at 
                        the DHS building in Industrial 
                        Village, at the corner of Briar 
                        and Maddox.

           After a moment, the dispatcher repeats.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LANIER
                        Should we respond to that?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Someone else will pick it up.

           INT. DHS BUILDING - DAY

           Welch puts his finger to the earpiece under his 
           balaclava. 

                                 WELCH
                        First call is in.  No response 
                        yet.

           Rodriguez jumps onto the security desk and screams 
           instructions to the employees.  The sight of the dead 
           security guards in the fountain, and the tone of his 
           voice, is enough to scare the life from them.

           Michael and Welch move to the vault door.  Michael drops 
           the backpack from his shoulders and together they unroll 
           the explosive device they had built earlier.  They 
           carefully attach it to the frame of the vault door.

           INT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S CAR - DAY

                                 DISPATCH (O.S.)
                                 (stressed)
                        I need a unit for a 2-11 Adam at 
                        the DHS building at Industrial 
                        Village.  Anyone.  

           Jeffery peeks momentarily at the speaker.  Lanier looks 
           nervously at Jeffery.  The Nextel in his hands wakes with 
           the sound of Ling’s voice.

                                 LING (O.S.)
                        Are you guys hearing this 2-11 
                        Adam?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Yeah, I fucking hear it!  

           Lanier raises the Nextel to his mouth.

                                 LANIER
                        Yeah, we got it.  Someone’ll pick 
                        it up.
           INT. DHS BUILDING - DAY

           Welch and Michael finish placing the explosive device 
           around the door frame and step back.  Welch holds a 
           detonation device and waits for the nod from Michael.

           Simultaneously, on both sides of the door, the device 
           erupts in a series of loud, penetrating explosions, 
           working its way to the top-center of the vault door.  The 
           final explosion is the most thunderous. The concussion 
           causes the ceiling above the atrium to shatter, dropping 
           a million pieces of thick, jagged glass over everyone.  
           The employees scream and cry with terror.

           Michael and Welch pass through the smoke and push the 
           vault door onto its side with relative ease.

           INT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S CAR - DAY

           Jeffery is sweating and grinding his teeth as they push 
           into South Central.

                                 DISPATCH (O.S.)
                        I need a unit for a 2-11 Adam-

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        -Alright, Damnit!  Send the other 
                        car.

           Lanier raises the Nextel to his mouth.

                                 LANIER
                        Ling, you guys are on the 2-11.

                                 LING (O.S.)
                        Copy.

           Jeffery watches the others pull away in his rearview.

                                 LING(O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Dispatch, Charlie 463 and three 
                        detectives responding to the 2-11.  
                        We’re seven out.

           Jeffery reaches down and turns off the second radio.

           INT. DHS BUILDING - DAY

           Rodriguez remains on the service table watching over the 
           employees who cry and bleed from tiny cuts.  He puts a 
           finger to his ear and yells loudly so his voice is heard 
           by Michael and Welch in the vault.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Response is in.  Just one car.  
                        ETA is seven.  Plenty of time.

           The vault is open and wide and the walls are lined with 
           large, sealed boxes and crates stenciled with shipping 
           codes from around the world.  A large electronic door to 
           the dock sits closed at the far end of the room.  

           Welch moves quickly about the room, firing at three 
           cameras placed in corners of the ceiling disabling them.

           Michael quickly scans the information on all the boxes 
           until he spots the group he’s looking for.  It’s labeled 
           in Arabic, French, and English.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Right here.

           Michael pulls crowbars from his backpack and they go to 
           work splitting open a group of boxes.  

           EXT. PROJECTS - DAY

           The first units arrive to Chris.  He takes command, 
           ordering a perimeter formed and evacuation area prepped.

           INT. DHS BUILDING - DAY

           The tops of the boxes are off and Michael and Welch pull 
           out packing material and toss it behind them.  

           Michael sifts through rolled up canvas, canisters, 
           computer hard-drives, jewelry boxes, and other 
           miscellaneous materials.  He finally reaches a container 
           at the bottom of the box.  He opens it and we see from 
           his expression it’s what Lustick has sent them for.  He 
           closes it and puts it inside his backpack.  

                                 WELCH
                        Mother of God!

           Michael turns quickly to Welch who is holding up a gold 
           brick engraved in Arabic with a picture of a temple.

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        There’s at least thirty more here.  

           Michael throws Welch the set of keys he took from the 
           security guard.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Get the van.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Welch runs towards the dock door.  He swipes the fob key 
           over a black panel and types in a code.  The door slowly 
           opens.  He drops his gear and slides under the door just 
           as it makes enough room for him to pass.

           INT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S CAR - DAY

           Jeffery and Lanier arrive near the scene, but are waved 
           off by other officers setting up a perimeter.  

           Jeffery jumps from his seat, shows his badge and states 
           his rank, and orders the officer to let them pass.

           INT. DHS BUILDING - DAY

           The door is wide open and the van is backed up to the 
           loading dock.  Michael has filled one bag and is working 
           to fill another with everything that will fit inside.

                                 RODRIGUEZ (O.S.)
                        Three minutes.  

           Welch pushes a rolling board over to the boxes and stacks 
           the gold bricks onto it as fast as Michael can pass them.  

           They push the cart directly into the van, tossing the 
           bags in after.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’re done!  Let’s go!

           Rodriguez jumps down from the table.  He drops a smoke 
           grenade at the vault door before running towards the van. 
           Thick smoke billows upward behind him.

           Michael and Rodriguez quickly strip their gear and toss 
           it into the van.  They double check to make sure they’ve 
           left nothing behind.  

           Michael tosses two more smoke grenades around the 
           exterior of the building and jumps into the passenger 
           seat.  

           The fire alarms flash red and white, the sirens horn, and 
           water spills from the sprinklers.  

           Welch drives down the back alley of Industrial Village 
           and exits through an open gate.  
           INT. VAN - DAY

           Welch and Michael scan mirrors to ensure no one is 
           following as they flow inconspicuously into traffic.  
           Rodriguez digs into a bag and pulls out his cell phone.  
           He opens it and dials a number.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Hey boss, it’s me.  I’m on this 
                        999.  Don’t bother, I’m already in 
                        route.  Alright.  Will do.

           Rodriguez snaps his phone shut and smiles.  

                                 RODRIGUEZ (CONT’D)
                        Can you hurry up, Welch.  There’s 
                        an officer down.

           They tense momentarily at the sound of a siren and 
           flashing lights moving towards them from the opposite 
           direction.  Payton, Ling, and company quickly pass, 
           moving towards the DHS building. 

           EXT. PROJECTS - DAY

           Rotor-wash from a chopper waiting to airlift Tompkins 
           sits in the field next to the building kicking up dust 
           and trash.  EMS units and police cruisers are everywhere.

           Jeffery runs through the mob of officers until he spots 
           Chris helping the medics load Tompkins onto a litter.

           Chris spots him and the two embrace in a long hug.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        You okay?

           Chris nods as they watch Tompkins loaded onto the bird.

           INT. AIRLIFT CHOPPER - DAY

           Tompkins lies on the litter securely fastened next to the 
           door of the bird.  His eyes are closed and he does not 
           move, but his head is tilted as if he were staring out 
           through the clear fiberglass door.

           The ground disappears, the buildings pass quickly, and 
           the view turns into blue sky as the bird ascends.  As it 
           maneuvers towards the hospital it banks hard right.  The 
           city reappears sprawled out below him and in the distance 
           white smoke rises from the DHS building.
           INT. PROJECTS - NIGHT

           Mobile lights illuminate the building with an odd 
           fluorescent burn.  Detectives sweep the walls for 
           fingerprints and mark possible evidence.  

           Chris and Jeffery speak quietly over Gabriel.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        He saved my life.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Maybe he was at your house to warn 
                        us.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        About Miller?  Doesn’t make sense.

           Rodriguez appears in the hallway wearing a suit and 
           carrying his evidence kit.  

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        SWAT’s got DeShaun Miller 
                        surrounded a few blocks from here.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Good.  Maybe we’ll get some 
                        answers.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        They ain’t gonna arrest him.  

           Jeffery acknowledges the insinuation with a nod.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        You’re Tompkins’s buddy, right?

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        More of an acquaintance, really.  
                        Hovering over some corpse seems 
                        the only time I ever see him.  Is 
                        he gonna make it?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I don’t know.

           Rodriguez points to Martin.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        You know this kid?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Not me, but Tompkins sure looked 
                        at him like he did.

           Rodriguez kneels down next to Gabriel and opens his 
           evidence kit to begin his examination of the scene.

           EXT. PROJECTS - NIGHT

           Lanier waits for Jeffery as he and Chris exit the 
           building. 

                                 LANIER
                        We need to get to that 2-11, boss.  
                        It’s a cluster fuck.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Was it our crew?

                                 LANIER
                        It appears that way.  The FBI has 
                        a team on station waiting for us.

           Jeffery looks to Chris, as if asking for permission.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I’m good.  Take care of your 
                        business.  

           INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Chris arrives in the lobby and is greeted by Gomez and a 
           couple other familiar faces from GED.  Michelle sits with 
           Alicia, her eyes swollen and red from crying.  

           Michelle spots Chris and they embrace in a long hug.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        How is he?

                                 MICHELLE
                        He’s in surgery.

           She shakes her head and her lips begin to quiver.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        It’s alright.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        I thought it was you for sure.  I 
                        felt it inside me.  

           He rubs her neck for a moment while she tries to compose 
           herself.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I wanted it to be someone else so 
                        badly.  I couldn’t lose you.  And 
                        now I feel sick to my stomach for 
                        wishing this onto them.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Don’t.  It’s okay.  Everyone has 
                        moments like that.  We’ve been 
                        through this before.  We’ll help 
                        them through it.  

           He kisses her and motions for her to comfort Alicia.  She 
           wipes her eyes and nods and turns away.

           He fills himself a cup of coffee from a station in the 
           lobby.  Smith comes from down the hallway and greets him.

                                 SMITH
                        I just got off the phone with 
                        Sergeant Nelson.  Miller’s dead.  
                        SWAT put a dozen holes in the 
                        motherfucker.  He went out blazing 
                        like his brother.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Who’s his brother?

                                 SMITH
                        You kidding?  LaMichael McCoy.  
                        Midtown.  Captain thinks Miller 
                        went gunning for you guys for 
                        killing him.  I ain’t never heard 
                        about retaliation like this.

           Chris is staggered by the news.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, Sergeant Nelson wants you 
                        to identify Miller as the man who 
                        shot at you before they start 
                        making statements.

           He snaps his fingers in front of Chris’s face.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Yeah.  I’m on my way.

                                 SMITH
                        You let any of us know if you need 
                        anything.
           INT. LAPD MEDICAL EXAMINERS CENTER - NIGHT

           DeShaun Miller lies covered by a white blanket on a cold 
           metal table in the middle of a frigid room.  His toe is 
           tagged and his clothes and possessions are laid out on a  
           table next to his body.

           The door opens and a FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST (woman, 40s) 
           escorts Chris into the room.  

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        They only brought him in an hour 
                        ago.  I’ve hardly had a chance to 
                        clean him up.

           She flashes a cordial smile and pulls away the sheet to 
           reveal Miller’s face and chest.  He’s riddled with fleshy 
           holes.  

                                 PATHOLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        Is that your man?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        It would appear that way.  Are 
                        those his things?

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        Yeah.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Has homicide combed any of it yet?

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        Nope.  They’re spread thin 
                        tonight.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Do you mind?

           She pulls a scalpel from a drawer attached to the table.

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        Don’t get your hands dirty.

           Chris uses the scalpel to push around his possessions: 
           bloody pants and jacket, a cell phone, wad of cash, loose 
           change, roach clip, wallet, and folded up piece of paper.  

           The pathologist stares intriguingly at Chris’s face until 
           he’s done.  He hands her back the scalpel.  As she’s 
           returning it to the drawer he grabs the folded piece of 
           paper and shoves it undetected into his pocket. 

                                 PATHOLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        I heard he almost killed you.

           Chris shrugs and responds with a puzzled smirk.

           INT.  LAPD MEDICAL EXAMINERS CENTER, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Chris steps into bathroom and ensures he’s alone.  He 
           unfolds the piece of paper. It reads 806 Washington, 2pm.

           His jaw tightens.  He slams his hands down hard onto a 
           sink and turns on the hot water.  He splashes his face 
           and looks into the mirror.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        No fucking way.

           INT. LAPD, SPECIAL UNIT INVESTIGATIONS HQ - DAY

           Jeffery walks out of his office carrying a tall stack of 
           files.  Lanier and Payton watch the news on a flat screen 
           television hanging from the wall.  Jeffery pauses to 
           watch the report by a journalist camped outside of the 
           DHS building.  

           She details the assassination of the TSA guards by three 
           heavily armed assailants using assault rifles and 
           explosives.  She reports that Federal Officials would not 
           reveal what items were stolen, but that they were set to 
           be transported by government planes to undisclosed 
           destinations the following day.

                                 PAYTON
                        It just doesn’t connect for me.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        What’s not to get?

                                 PAYTON
                        The whole thing.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        You heard the witnesses.  They had 
                        our radios.  They were monitoring 
                        the triple-nine and our response. 
                        They had the lay of the land. 

           Ling enters the room and avoids eye contact with Jeffery.

                                 LANIER
                        So why all the smoke, then?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        If you’re looking for a fire, 
                        you’re not looking for them.

                        They’re now the problem of the 
                        FBI.  They’ll be here this 
                        afternoon to collect everything.

           Jeffery sets the files on a desk in front of Ling.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Please see to it that everything 
                        is properly organized.

           Ling looks up to him coldly.

                                 LING
                        The captain would like to see you 
                        first thing tomorrow.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        I’m sure he would, Ling.

           Jeffery walks past them towards the exit.

           EXT. CLIFF OVERLOOKING THE PCH, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Michael stands against a maroon sedan, staring at a full 
           moon lighting the dark expanse of the Pacific.  Two pairs 
           of lights from vehicles approach from a distance.  He’s 
           grown a pepper colored beard and darkened his hair.  A 
           black gym bag rests at his feet.  

           Two Suburbans pull up next to him.  SEVERAL MEN, 
           including Shabot and Feldman, step out armed with pistols 
           and assault rifles.  They survey the terrain as they 
           scatter into positions around Michael.  

           Shabot pats him down and removes a pistol hidden under 
           his coat, against his back.  Lustick steps out moments 
           later.      

                                 LUSTICK
                        You did it!  I wasn’t sure you’d 
                        pull it off.  The other crew had 
                        been prepping for weeks and they 
                        hadn’t cracked it.  Bold move 
                        using the police as their own 
                        diversion.  Callous, but spirited 
                        nonetheless. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You didn’t leave us much of a 
                        choice.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUSTICK
                        Motivation my friend.  There’s no 
                        limit to what desperate men will 
                        do when pushed.  

           He reaches out his hand, but Michael refuses.

                                 LUSTICK (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry to hear about your 
                        brother.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No you’re not, so don’t even 
                        fucking speak about him.

           Lustick smiles coldly at Michael, brushing off the 
           insolence.

                                 LUSTICK
                        Where’s the rest of your crew?  I 
                        should like to meet them.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s not going to happen.  
                        They’re gone.  

                                 LUSTICK
                        Are they?

                                 MICHAEL
                        You said it yourself.  This was 
                        it.

                                 LUSTICK
                        You don’t think I could find out?  
                        I think I’ll shake a few limbs and 
                        see what falls.  

           Michael takes a few steps towards Lustick.  His men 
           respond quickly, switching their weapons from safe, to 
           fire.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re a lying sack of shit, you 
                        know that?  I held on to a chance 
                        this would square it, but I knew 
                        you’d fuck us.   

                                 LUSTICK
                        No.  You did that to yourselves.

           Shabot raises a pistol a few feet from the back of 
           Michael’s head.  Michael senses the gun, but gazes 
           intensely at Lustick, who returns the heated stare.

                        I always liked you, Michael, but 
                        your pride, joined with the rest 
                        of your virtues, chokes them all.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m not going to beg.

                                 LUSTICK
                        No.  I don’t expect you would.

           After a moment, Lustick turns and motions to Feldman, who 
           stands by waiting next to the suburban.  He reaches into 
           the vehicle and pulls out a tan leather bag and walks 
           towards Michael.  

           He drops the leather bag he’s carrying at Michael’s feet 
           and opens the gym bag.  He reaches inside and pulls out a 
           container, the same one stolen from the DHS building.  He 
           shows it to Lustick before he returns it to the bag.

                                 LUSTICK (CONT’D)
                        Ten years of history, and the fact 
                        you pulled off this job, is the 
                        only reason you’re still 
                        breathing.  Take your money and go 
                        and don’t ever come here again.  
                        In fact, don’t even think on it, 
                        because I’ll hear it.  

           Surprised, Michael looks down at the leather bag and back 
           to Lustick.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What about my crew?

                                 LUSTICK
                        You don’t have a crew anymore.

           Lustick shakes his head and shrugs.  He motions to 
           Shabot, who lowers his gun and hands Michael back his 
           pistol.

                                 LUSTICK (CONT’D)
                        Go before I change my mind.

           Michael slowly picks up the leather bag Feldman left at 
           his feet.  He glances at Lustick’s men as he carefully 
           climbs into his car.  He turns the ignition and 
           cautiously drives away.
           INT. MAROON SEDAN - NIGHT

           In the rear-view mirror Michael watches as Lustick 
           returns to his Suburban.  Feldman follows with the gym 
           bag directly behind, as the other men slowly make the way 
           back to their respective vehicles.

           Michael looks down at the leather bag lying in the 
           passenger seat.  He opens it to reveal large stacks of 
           cash.  Relieved and shocked, he takes a deep breath, 
           smirks, and speeds away.

           INT. LAPD STATION, GANG SQUAD HQ - DAY

           Chris sits in the back of the shift meeting as Sergeant 
           Nelson finishes his briefing.  

                                 NELSON
                        Allow me to introduce Detective 
                        Russell Welch.  He’s joining us 
                        from UC Narcotics.  

           Welch stands at the opposite corner of the room from 
           Chris.  His hair is short and his beard neatly trimmed.  

                                 SMITH
                        Didn’t I arrest you last month for 
                        buying dope in Inglewood?

                                 WELCH
                        Probably.  I think I’ve been 
                        arrested by most of you.

           The other officers laugh and welcome him heartily.  

           LATER:

           A Sergeants’ Test Study Guide hides a copy of Tompkins’s 
           file which Chris discreetly examines.  He fingers down 
           boxes marked ‘exceeds standard’ for every rating factor.  
           At the bottom he comes to a box identifying fluent 
           languages.  English and Spanish are both marked.  Chris 
           sighs in angst.  

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        Mind if I park myself here?

           Surprised, Chris looks up from the file.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Be my guest.  

           Welch reaches over the desk and offers his hand.

                        Russell Welch.  I’m your new 
                        partner.  

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD, SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

           Chris drives the unmarked Crown Royal through a 
           neighborhood as Welch looks out the passenger window.  

           He parks in front of the two old men playing chess.  
           Banger #1 and #2 watch with a handful of others from 
           their porch.  The younger boys from before approach them.

                                 KID #1
                        What’s up Officer Allen?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Hey little man.

                                 KID #2
                        Who’s this?

                                 WELCH
                        I’m Officer Welch.

                                 KID #2 
                        Where’s Terrell?

           Welch is about to respond, but carefully holds it back.

                                 WELCH
                        Who?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        He means Officer Tompkins.  
                        Officer Welch is my new partner.

           Chris motions to Welch to hang tight and walks up towards 
           the porch.  Banger #1 and #2 stand and walk towards him.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Professor.  

                                 BANGER #1
                        Officer Allen.  For real, we 
                        didn’t know about DeShaun.  He had 
                        his own shit going.

                                 BANGER #2
                        That fool was crazy.  We don’t 
                        play like that.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I appreciate it.  Did you guys see 
                        Officer Tompkins around here 
                        without me before he got shot?

                                 BANGER #1
                        A couple times.  He’d pull up and 
                        talk to DeShaun.  Like I said, he 
                        had his own shit on the side.

           Chris takes a moment to digest the information.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        You know why you originally called 
                        yourselves ‘Cribs?’

                                 BANGER #1
                        No.  Why?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        Find out.  I’ll be back in a 
                        couple days for my answer.

           INT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jeffery Allen opens his eyes, jarred awake from a nap by 
           a banging at the front door.  He sits up slowly.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Who is it?

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (O.S.)
                        It’s Chris, Uncle Jeff.

           Jeffery tries to straighten himself up.  Bottles of 
           alcohol are everywhere, and he looks and smells as stale 
           as the room.  He opens the door for Chris who is dressed 
           in his GED gear.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Just catching up on some rest.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I can see that.  I stopped by your 
                        office and there’s an itty-bitty-
                        Asian-titty with her name on your 
                        desk. 

           The picture described cuts Jeffery deep.

                        After your ordeal and the 
                        robberies, I felt that, well they 
                        felt that it was time for me to 
                        call it quits.  I wanted to tell 
                        you.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        You don’t look too convinced?

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        If nine out of ten Russians tell 
                        you you’re drunk, you better lie 
                        down.  

           Chris nods and looks about the room.

           EXT. JEFFERY ALLEN’S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - DAY

           Jeffery and Chris sit on a porch swing drinking beer.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        No one’s above suspicion at this 
                        point, but they’re dismissing the 
                        timing as pure coincidence.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        Bullshit.  Michael Laird and 
                        Gabriel Martin were running that 
                        crew and got DeShaun Miller 
                        involved.  The whole thing was 
                        planned.  Miller goes after you 
                        and Tompkins to kick off a triple-
                        nine.  

           Jeffery takes a sip from his beer.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Martin grows a conscience, tries 
                        to stop it, and gets plugged.  
                        Think about it.  On every job they 
                        ran with four, but this one only 
                        had three?  It’s because Martin 
                        wasn’t there.

           Chris nods, but doesn’t reveal his thoughts entirely.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        It would certainly appear that 
                        way.  I’m beginning to believe 
                        anything is possible.

                        the possible becomes probable.  

           Jeffery takes a deep breath to change the subject.

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad to know they found a 
                        suitable replacement for me.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        No one can replace you.  

           Jeffery’s lips quiver as he fights away a fit of tears.  

                                 JEFFERY ALLEN
                        I gave my life to this city.  I 
                        don’t know what to do with myself.  

           Chris puts an arm around his back.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        You can start by taking a shower.

           Jeffery laughs as he pushes the drops from his eyes.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Then come over for dinner.  The

           EXT. DESERTED ROCK QUARRY - DAY

           Rodriguez leans against an unmarked police cruiser as a 
           car approaches down a dirt road.  He removes his 
           sunglasses and waves.

           Michael pulls up next to him in a new sedan.  He steps 
           out and the two greet one another with a firm handshake.

                                 MICHAEL

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        He pulled some strings and got 
                        transferred out of UC to a 
                        different department.  Starts his 
                        new job today, but he sends his 
                        regards.

           Michael shakes his head and smiles.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What’s the latest?

                        shot execution style.

           Rodriguez takes a beat to read Michael’s expression.

                                 RODRIGUEZ (CONT’D)
                        FBI ain’t revealing a damn thing.  
                        I don’t know how much they have on 
                        you, but you’re on top of their 
                        water-board list.  I hear they’ve 
                        created a fucking think tank on 
                        how to find you.

           Michael nods and turns to his trunk.  He opens it and 
           pulls out the tan, leather bag full of cash.

                                 MICHAEL

                        Give him a call next week.  He’s

                        We all agreed to put in another 
                        year or two on the force to meet 
                        appearances.  After that

                        part of me hopes he don’t.  He’s

                                 RODRIGUEZ (CONT’D)
                        No one’s come, Mike.  Your family, 
                        they don’t want him.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What will they do with the body?

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Burn him to ashes.

           Michael’s eyes fill with just the slightest hint of tears 
           as he stares past Rodriguez, who looks him over for a 
           long, arduous beat.

                                 RODRIGUEZ (CONT’D)
                        That’s it then?

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s it.

           A nearby passenger jet ascending into the sky momentarily 
           grabs Michael’s attention.  He looks back to find 
           Rodriguez shaking his head, his pistol drawn.  Surprised 
           by the gun, a bemused smile crosses Michael’s face.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        What’s this? 

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Sorry, Mike.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What are you doing?

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        We didn’t want it this way, but 
                        you’re the only one left who can 
                        connect us.

                                 MICHAEL
                        To who?  Lustick?  He’s dead.
           INT. LUSTICK’S SUBURBAN, PCH - LAST NIGHT

           Lustick sits comfortably inside the modified SUV as it 
           travels down the Pacific Coast Highway.  He turns to 
           Feldman who sits behind him.

                                 LUSTICK
                        Hand me the box.

           Feldman removes the container from the bag and hands it 
           forward to Lustick.  Lustick sits it on his lap and wraps 
           his hands around it.  He opens the box and a large, 
           concussive flame tears him apart.  A second later, it 
           ignites the fuel tank, engulfing the entire interior of 
           the suburban with fire.

           EXT. DESERTED ROCK QUARRY - DAY

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Holy shit!  You fucking killed 
                        him.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wasn’t sure he’d ever let us go.  
                        It was a means to an end.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Why the fuck didn’t you say 
                        something before?

           Michael stares calmly at Rodriguez and motions to his 
           pistol.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Put it away, Rod.

           Rodriguez slowly pulls himself back into the moment and 
           shakes his head.  His face turns red as he asserts 
           himself back into the domineering position.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        I can’t do that, man.  I’ve 
                        already pulled on you.  Fuck, man.  
                        The trust is gone.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not yet, it’s not.  You still have 
                        a choice.  You’ll never hear from 
                        me again.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        We’ve already decided.    

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MICHAEL
                        Fuck what you decided!  I put more 
                        money in your hands than you ever 
                        dreamed.  I gave you guys 
                        everything.  In what we do, 
                        loyalty is all we have, our only 
                        defense.  You break that now, 
                        you’re breaking it forever.  Don’t 
                        fucking do this.

           He nods to the bag of money and offers an unpropitious 
           shrug to Rodriguez.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Don’t look so surprised.

           Rodriguez shrugs and wipes drops of sweat from his brow.

                                 RODRIGUEZ (CONT’D)
                        Are you ready?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I never thought I’d live that 
                        long, but I didn’t imagine going 
                        out like this.  

           Michael takes a deep breath and hopelessly measures his 
           options.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Aim carefully.

                                 RODRIGUEZ
                        Goodbye, Mike.

           Michael smirks and quickly reaches for the pistol resting 
           under his jacket, tucked under his belt.

           Rodriguez immediately fires, hitting Michael in the neck.  
           As he stammers backwards into his car, Rodriguez takes 
           careful aim and puts a round into his head.  Blood, 
           brains, and bone explode from the back of his skull onto 
           the walls of the trunk.

           Michael’s body goes limp and falls towards the 
           compartment.  Rodriguez grimaces as he pushes him 
           backwards and lifts his legs inside.  He looks down at 
           Michael’s body and wipes the prints from his pistol and 
           tosses it in.  

           He closes the trunk, puts the car in gear, and watches as 
           it drives itself over the edge of the quarry and 
           disappears from view.
           INT. CHRIS ALLEN’S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jeffery plays with Trevor and speaks kindly to Alicia, 
           who sits across the table watching him through sad eyes.  
           Tabitha flings food at Michelle, who sits at the far end 
           of the table from Chris, drawing everyone’s laughter.

           Chris sits at the head of the table watching everyone 
           quietly.  He cheats a smile, but his mind is elsewhere.  
           He takes a long hard look at Alicia and pushes food 
           around his plate.

           INT. TOMPKINS’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Chris sits at a chair next to Tompkins’s bed.  Tompkins 
           is hooked up to several machines.  A very light, steady 
           beeping from a heart monitor is the only sound.  Chris 
           pushes a button on the machine and silences it.  

           He opens his fist to reveal a heavy, silver coin engraved 
           with the LAPD: Gang Enforcement Detail around a bronze 
           star.  He places it inside Tompkins’s hand and closes his 
           fingers around it.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN
                        I found this in your desk.  

           Chris looks him over, contempt and bewilderment piercing 
           through his gaze.  His eyes return to Tompkins’s hand, 
           which twitches just slightly enough to notice.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        My wife says I jerk my finger when 
                        I dream, like I’m pulling a 
                        trigger.  I never miss in my 
                        sleep.  

           A beat.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        I must’ve made it hard on you, 
                        being so eager to please.  Christ, 
                        you even gave me an out, but you 
                        knew I wouldn’t take it.  I bet it 
                        really twisted you up inside, 
                        sitting there listening to me to 
                        go on and on.  Alicia’s been 
                        staying with us the last three 
                        weeks.  She’s completely lost.  
                        Michelle won’t let her out of her 
                        sight.

           CONTINUED:
                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        The doctors are feeding her hope, 
                        but I want to shake her and tell 
                        her not to waste another tear over 
                        a worthless fuck like you.  

           Chris walks to the side of the bed.  His face grows red 
           and his eyes slowly water with tears of rage.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        You just stood in the dark, 
                        waiting.  Couldn’t even do it 
                        yourself.  Did you pray for my 
                        soul while you sat there and 
                        shook?

           He leans over Tompkins, hovering just a few inches over 
           his face.  

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m not numb any more.  I don’t 
                        feel but one fucking thing.  

           He lowers his hands an inch from Tompkins’s throat.  
           Veins pop from his hands and his knuckles go white as he 
           momentarily pretends to flex them around his jugular.  

           He pushes the tears away from his eyes, but a few escape 
           and land on Tompkin’s cheek.

                                 CHRIS ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        I found my purpose, Terrell.  I’m 
                        making it my life’s work.  You’re 
                        better off hidden away in there.  
                        A miracle would be wasted on you. 
                        Either way, I’m going to find out 
                        to what end you planned this.  I’m 
                        going to find everyone you were 
                        involved with.  And then, I’m 
                        going to add a few more coins to 
                        my box.  Starting with yours.  

           Chris takes a deep breath, and collects himself.  He 
           reaches over to the heart machine and re-engages the 
           sound on the monitor.  He takes one last glance at 
           Tompkins and turns and walks out of the room.

           THE END:
