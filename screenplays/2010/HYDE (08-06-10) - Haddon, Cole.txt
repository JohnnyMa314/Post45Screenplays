           FADE IN ON:

           The faces of terrified SCOTLAND YARD CONSTABLES and 
           INSPECTORS, each nervously aiming firearms at--

           EXT. STREET - LONDON HOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s a beautiful home, shrouded in darkness. The lanterns 
           being waved by authorities do little to help this. 

           There must be 50 coppers here, positioned behind paddy 
           wagons, carts, horses, whatever they could find. The period’s 
           equivalent of a SWAT ACTION.

           Behind this line stands INSPECTOR WILLIAM NEWCOMEN (50; 
           stocky), the man in charge of the operation. 

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Easy, men. Easy now.

           Beside him, uneasy for reasons we don’t understand yet, is 
           DR. JOHN GABRIEL UTTERSON (late-30s; tall and lanky).

           They, like everybody else, are anxiously watching the SIX 
           RIFLE-ARMED CONSTABLES making their way up the walk to the 
           house’s open, dark front door. 

           INT. FOYER - LONDON HOUSE - 

           The six constables, all trembling, nudge the door open with 
           their weapons. Slowly enter near-total darkness.

                                 CONSTABLE #1
                        Do you see anything?

                                 CONSTABLE #3
                        Oh, dear Lord.

                                 CONSTABLE #1
                        What is it? 

           Constable #3 turns and vomits through the hand he can’t get 
           to his mouth fast enough.

                                 CONSTABLE #1
                        What is it?!

                                 CONSTABLE #4
                        It’s Parker, sir. 

           On the ground, we catch a glimpse of an arm lying in blood.
                                 CONSTABLE #4
                        Most of ‘im, at least.

                                 CONSTABLE #2
                        The rest of ‘im’s over ‘ere. 
                        Duncan, as well.

           The front door behind them CREAKS, then SLAMS SUDDENLY--

           EXT. STREET - LONDON HOUSE - CONT'D

           Newcomen, Utterson, and constables watch as GUNFIRE 
           illuminates windows. A strobing effect that reveals 
           frightening glimpses of what’s happening inside.

                                 UTTERSON
                        I warned you this might happen, 
                        Inspector. I warned you!

           The front door crashes off its hinges, falling outside with 
           Constable #1 who was thrown through it.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Somebody ‘elp the lad!

           But nobody moves, petrified by the SCREAMS OF AGONY now 
           coming from the house.

           Constable #1 starts to rise when something grabs his ankles. 
           He’s dragged back inside, screaming now, too.

           Then, SILENCE. Not even the sound of Scotland Yard’s finest 
           breathing. 

           Newcomen looks at Utterson, then at his men. Eleven seconds 
           of this...twelve...thirteen--

           Suddenly, something explodes through the house’s roof, flying 
           into the night sky. A good 30 feet up, climbing, climbing...

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Is that...?

           A moment later, Constable #1 lands with a sickening crunch in 
           the front garden. Body a twisted mess.

           Newcomen is dumbstruck. Everybody is looking to him for 
           direction, though, and he knows he has to act.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A long wooden case with brass trim being opened. Inside, the 
           scariest looking ELEPHANT GUN ever made.
                                 UTTERSON
                        When I confided in you, Inspector, 
                        you swore you wouldn’t kill him.

           Newcomen lifts the gun as CONSTABLE #5 hands him a large drug-
           filled DART. The elephant gun is a TRANQUILIZER GUN.

                                 CONSTABLE #5
                        It’s powerful enough to take down 
                        an elephant. I dare say two of ‘em.

           Utterson looks heartsick over all this.

                                 UTTERSON
                        You can’t use that on him. He’s a 
                        man--  

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Are you mad?! HE’S A MONSTER!

           He shoves Utterson aside.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        And I want his head on my mantle.

           As Newcomen stalks toward the house, loading the dart--

                                 UTTERSON
                        We had a deal! 
                             (sotto)
                        He’s my friend.

           INT. FOYER - LONDON HOUSE - CONT’D

           Newcomen slowly enters, stepping over the bodies of dead 
           constables. Shoe slipping in blood.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        I know you’re in here. I’m not 
                        afraid of you.

           A deep, guttural voice growls out of the darkness as Newcomen 
           tries to track the direction its coming from--

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        How many years will they remember 
                        my name, Inspector? How many years 
                        will they cry out--

           Newcomen ROARS at movement, FIRING THE GUN at a blur of 
           shadows coming at him from above--

           FREEZE FRAME, RED LETTERS splattering like paint, or BLOOD, 
           against the static image. Immediately begin dripping.
           TITLE CARD: HYDE

           CREDITS ROLL over a swirling newspaper montage of the rise 
           and fall of DR. HENRY JEKYLL (whose face never seems to 
           reveal itself). He was an altruistic scientific genius, 
           Utterson proudly at his side; newly engaged to MILLICENT 
           ROSE; then a rash of murders of vagrants and criminals; the 
           citywide manhunt for EDWARD HYDE follows; news of Hyde’s 
           climactic death and Newcomen’s part in it; and, finally,
           scientists continue to fail at explaining Jekyll’s serum.

           FADE IN:

           EXT. VARIOUS - WHITECHAPEL, LONDON - NIGHT

           BIRD’S EYE VIEW: Drifting above the maze of streets that 
           comprise Whitechapel, a circus of poverty and depravity. 

           Only the loudest sounds reach us, many SCREAMS. Eventually, 
           though, these dissipate. Subsumed by the slow build of a 
           HEARTBEAT...a heart beating INCREASINGLY FAST. 

           When the frantic drumming reaches its crescendo--

           EXT. STREET - WHITECHAPEL - CONT’D

           SILENCE now, except for MUFFLED MURMURING. It’s a residential 
           area, and we’re looking at a SHADOWY FIGURE hunched and 
           kneeling on the cobblestone sidewalk.

           He’s dressed all in black. Top hat. Knee-length slicker 
           spread around him like dark wings as he works.

           Is that a woman’s LEG AND BOOT sticking out from under him? 
           Is that a woman’s ARM AND HAND slowly waving back and forth?

           A SURGEON’S KNIFE draws away from the body of his prostitute-
           victim, blood dripping from its well-polished surface. We 
           can’t see what the figure is doing to her, but it can’t be 
           good. Can’t be good at all.

           CLOSE on one of the prostitute MARY ANNE NICHOLS’ teary eyes, 
           the murky head and top hat of her killer -- the WHITECHAPEL 
           MURDERER, as history first called him -- reflected across it. 
           She’s in a state of shock, murmuring the best she can manage. 

                                 MARY ANNE NICHOLS
                        Ple...

           Blood spurts up, striking the Murderer’s “medical collar” -- 
           his slicker’s upturned, exaggerated collar buttoned in the 
           front to protect/hide his face.
                                 MARY ANNE NICHOLS
                        Sir, ple...

           The Murderer, standing now. His face still masked, he 
           considers Nichols -- then sweeps away with a snarl like some 
           supernatural beast of the night.

           OVERHEAD: Nichols lies on her back, abandoned. Arms out but 
           askew. Blood collecting around her.

                                 MARY ANNE NICHOLS
                        Pl...ple...ease...

           INT. ANGLICAN CATHEDRAL - DAY

           Morning mass. ESTABLISHING SHOT from behind the CRUCIFIX that 
           hangs above the altar, looking down upon the CONGREGATION 
           (Christ’s crucified figure mirrors Nichols’ death repose).

                                 PRIEST (O.S.)
                        In each of us, two natures are at 
                        war: the good and the evil. 

           THOMAS ADYE (28) sits at the end of a pew, listening to the 
           PRIEST’s sermon. His back to us, so we can’t see his face.

           Sunlight from an opening door falls across him as somebody 
           enters OS.

                                 PRIEST
                        All our lives the fight goes on 
                        between them, and one of them must 
                        conquer.

           A CONSTABLE, call him RED-FACE, approaches Adye from behind.

                                 PRIEST
                        Will it be the beauty of good, or 
                        evil and its trick of making 
                        goodness seem ugly and weak?

           Red-Face leans down, to whisper into Adye’s ear--

                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                        Thomas Adye?

           Adye whispers back, their conversation kept at a hushed, 
           respectful level. We still don’t see his face.

                                 ADYE
                        Cap.

                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                        Sir?
                                 ADYE
                        Your cap, Officer. Remove it in 
                        here.

                                 PRIEST
                        Goodness, after all, is what 
                        separates Man from the beast and 
                        demons and Lucifer himself.

           Red-Face removes his helmet, looking around as if 
           embarrassed. Leans back to whisper in Adye’s ear except--

                                 ADYE
                        There’s been a murder, yes I know.

                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                             (surprised)
                        But how, Inspector?

                                 ADYE
                        It’s how my days always begin.

           He doesn’t wait for the priest to conclude the sermon before 
           standing to leave. Our attention remains on the priest--

                                 PRIEST
                        But remember always, the power to 
                        choose is in our own hands. What we 
                        want most to be, we are.

           EXT. STREET - WHITECHAPEL - LATER

           CLOSE on Nichols’ dead face, a fly buzzing about dry blood 
           spattered around her lips and chin. Eyes empty, sad.

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY (O.S.)
                        Looks like the killer slashed her 
                        about the neck there. We reckon 
                        that’s what did her in.

           ADYE is crouched beside the corpse. This is our first look at 
           him: almost 30, lanky, intense eyes. Dress, including his 
           bowler, suggests a serious man with serious aspirations.

                                 ADYE
                        Slash? Hardly. 

           Behind him, CONSTABLE TAMBERLY listens as other CONSTABLES 
           try to hold back REPORTERS and a CROWD. 

           A CRIME-SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER prepares a camera over Nichols.
                                 ADYE
                        These incisions are precise, the 
                        large vessels on both sides of the 
                        neck severed. Precise...but 
                        confident. 

           Two prostitutes in the crowd watch him examine the corpse, 
           sickened: ginger-haired MARY JANE KELLY (25; girl-next-door 
           beautiful) and her frightened black friend NETTY (17).

                                 ADYE
                        Even a knife, say, eight inches in 
                        length, would take considerable 
                        strength to so deftly cut without 
                        resorting to crude sawing.
                             (looks up at Tamberly)
                        What was her name?

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        Mary Nichols, perhaps 40, perhaps 
                        45. Her friends can’t agree on a 
                        figure.

           Mary Jane and Netty are those teary friends. 

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        I, ah, I don’t mean to interject 
                        myself into your investigation, 
                        sir, but...has it occurred to you 
                        this one is a prostitute. Just like 
                        that Martha Tabram three weeks ago.

                                 ADYE
                        It has indeed, Mr. Tamberly. Middle-
                        aged, murdered in the middle of the 
                        night as well. 

           He lifts the corpse’s long skirt and petticoats; underneath, 
           torn stockings. Tamberly reaches out to stop him.

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        Inspector, be decent!

                                 ADYE
                        Whatever for? The killer most 
                        certainly wasn’t.

           Netty gasps, hand flying to her mouth. Mary Jane protectively 
           pulls her face into her shoulder, so she doesn’t look.

                                 MARY JANE
                        You’ve done seen enough. Let’s go.

           She makes the sign of the cross, then leads Netty away.
           Adye motions for Tamberly to look at the corpse’s OS groin. 

                                 ADYE
                        The incisions across the neck “did 
                        her in,” you were correct about 
                        that. But not until after this 
                        perniciousness was carried out.

           CONSTABLE WEAK STOMACH catches a glimpse of what’s being 
           shown to Tamberly and spins away, retching. 

                                 CONSTABLE WEAK STOMACH
                        Oh Gaw--

           Adye counts OS wounds, finger pointing here and there.

                                 ADYE
                        Eight, nine...11...that’s 28 fewer 
                        stab wounds than Tabram suffered. 
                             (grimly)
                        The killer is growing more 
                        efficient. 

           The crime scene photographer’s flash pops loudly and we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           Several feet from Nichols’ corpse, Tamberly indicates for 
           Adye two crimson footprint-shaped spots on the sidewalk. Each 
           flagged by lead-weighted reeds and fluttering ribbons. 

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        Here are the two footprints I told 
                        you about.

                                 ADYE
                        How far would you say it is between 
                        those, Mr. Tamberly?

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        Eight feet, perhaps nine. He was 
                        probably running, sir.

           Adye attempts to duplicate the stride between the distant 
           footprints/ribbons, comically overextending himself without 
           thinking -- and stumbles forward. Tamberly catches him.

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        Careful, sir.

           Constables and PEOPLE IN THE CROWD chuckle at Adye’s tumble, 
           including a CONSTABLE WHINGER.
                                 CONSTABLE WHINGER
                        Future a police work? He don’t look 
                        so smart ta me.

                                 CONSTABLE WEAK STOMACH
                             (wiping vomit from beard)
                        Bloody poof.

           Adye, embarrassed, straightens his coat. Turns to consider 
           the stride again.

                                 ADYE
                        When I was a student at 
                        Giggleswick, Mr. Tamberly--

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        But that’s in Yorkshire, sir. I’d 
                        heard you were from right here in 
                        Whitechapel.

           Adye winces almost imperceptibly at this, but tries not to 
           let Tamberly notice. He smiles politely and continues.

                                 ADYE
                        Yes, well. When I was at 
                        Giggleswick, Eddie Lacey was the 
                        best long jumper in my year...and 
                        couldn’t clear eight feet on his 
                        best day. This is...most unusual.

           He notices something on a wooden fence along the sidewalk, a 
           smeared BLOODY FOOTPRINT four feet up the side of the paling.

                                 ADYE
                        Now what’s this?

           He crouches to investigate, wondering how it got there. Then 
           looks up...up...up...20 feet up a brick wall, to where 
           SEVERAL BLOODY HUMAN HANDPRINTS are visible on a pipe there.

           Adye stands, still looking up. Tamberly joins him.

                                 ADYE
                        What manner of man can double my 
                        best stride, Mr. Tamberly...then 
                        spring more than 20 feet up a wall 
                        to his escape?

           INT. INSPECTOR’S POOL - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           This is where dozens of inspectors’ desks sit, a hectic -- 
           but to us today, familiar -- setting. Prominently placed is 
           an office door and a frosted window that reads-- 
           CHIEF INSPECTOR WILLIAM NEWCOMEN

                                 NEWCOMEN (O.S.)
                        I’ve seen the same thing before 
                        myself. Five years ago now.

           INT. NEWCOMEN’S OFFICE - SCOTLAND YARD - CONT'D

           A framed newspaper article hangs on the wall, declaring 
           EDWARD HYDE DEAD and William Newcomen the HERO responsible.

                                 NEWCOMEN (O.S.)
                        Twelve men died that day. 27 more 
                        done in before we stopped ‘im--

           PULL BACK over the shoulder of NEWCOMEN (now 55) as he turns. 
           Hair greyer, he looks 30 pounds heavier than when we saw him.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        --including an MP and a baby.

           He’s speaking to Adye across the room.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        We would’ve never got ‘im neither, 
                        if not for ‘is best mate.

                                 ADYE
                        With Hyde dead, whom might I speak 
                        with to explore possible 
                        connections between the cases, sir?

           Newcomen begins stuffing his pipe with tobacco.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Oh, Hyde’s not dead.

                                 ADYE
                        Sir?

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        The public needed to believe as 
                        much -- and I wanted to oblige 
                        them, trust me -- but the powers 
                        that be wondered if perhaps there 
                        was something we could learn from 
                        ‘is “illness.” Learn from a madman, 
                        isn’t that rich? 

                                 ADYE
                        Alive, sir? But where?

           Newcomen’s mouth curls up at one corner, under his mustache. 
           With the hand holding his pipe, he points down.
                                 ADYE
                             (surprised)
                        Under Scotland Yard? All this time?

           Newcomen strikes a match, lights his pipe.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        His doctor claim he’s cured. Even 
                        goes by the name Jekyll again, as 
                        if ‘e could shed Hyde with some 
                        mental calisthenics. Don’t you bet 
                        on it. 

                                 ADYE
                        Perhaps if I spoke with him about 
                        our case, he could shed some light--

           Newcomen yanks his pipe from his lips to suddenly shout--

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Don’t even consider it!

           Newcomen calms himself; clearly a man who knows his temper is 
           unprofessional. Pipe back in his mouth, smoking.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        When I was young, Inspector, my 
                        father taught me that, when faced 
                        with two evils, the lesser of them 
                        must always be chosen. 
                             (beat)
                        My vocation, ‘owever, ‘as revealed 
                        to me ‘ow truly full of shite my 
                        father actually was. 
                             (pointedly)
                        If you open the door to a lesser 
                        evil, other far, far greater ones 
                        invariably slink in behind it. Do 
                        you understand me?

                                 ADYE
                        Yes, sir.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Stay away from Hyde, Inspector. 
                        ‘E's like a poison that keeps 
                        working at you. A poison, just ask 
                        ‘is mate Utterson.

                                 ADYE
                        Yes, sir, of course.

           But his eyes make it clear he arrogantly disagrees. He turns 
           for the door. Stops, looks back.
                                 ADYE
                        Um, sir. There’s a rumor going 
                        about that I was, uh, born in 
                        Whitechapel. 

           Newcomen sits behind his desk, ready to get back to work.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        A rumor, as I understand it, is 
                        untrue.

                                 ADYE
                        I thought personal files were kept 
                        confidential.

           Newcomen doesn’t even look up from the file he’s opened.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Get the ‘ell out of ‘ere, 
                        Inspector. Go catch my killer.

           INT. UNDERGROUND STAIRWELL - SCOTLAND YARD - LATER

           Adye, carrying a thick file, and the eccentric DR. BREUER 
           (60s; thin Dr. Freud) descend dark stairs into the stone-
           walled bowels of Scotland Yard. Into the abyss.

                                 DR. BREUER
                        However did you convince that 
                        mammoth mass of moronism, Newcomen, 
                        to grant you access? 

                                 ADYE
                        Perhaps, ah, you should just tell 
                        me more about the prisoner, Doctor.

           Breuer hides his smirk, knowing he’s being lied to. But this 
           man’s pride in his work demands that he show it off.

                                 DR. BREUER
                        Ven the patient, Inspector, not
                        prisoner, first arrived, the 
                        persona of Edvard Hyde had taken 
                        over entirely. Henry Jekyll had 
                        become a sub-conscious prisoner in 
                        his own body as a result of medical 
                        experimentation upon himself, and 
                        remained this vay until a year ago. 
                        That was ven I achieved my first 
                        break-through. I vas able to speak 
                        directly vith Henry.

           There’s a self-satisfied glee in Breuer’s voice.
                                 DR. BREUER
                        Today, thanks to my care, Henry has 
                        once again reasserted his authority 
                        over the physical form the two 
                        personas shared.

                                 ADYE
                        And Hyde?

                                 DR. BREUER
                        Is a bad dream, a bad dream from 
                        vich Henry might never vake
                        entirely. He remembers everything 
                        Hyde did, everything he thought. 

           Disappointment crosses his face.

                                 DR. BREUER
                        The man you vill meet is Henry 
                        Jekyll, Inspector, but not the same 
                        Henry Jekyll once revered by his 
                        friends as the best man they knew. 
                        He can be, vaht’s the vord?
                        Disconcerting to many, 
                        disconcerting. Hyde has given him a 
                        perspective on the human condition 
                        that troubles, yes, even me.

           INT. DUNGEON - SCOTLAND YARD - CONT'D

           Adye and Breuer reach the “dungeon,” a dank hallway dimly lit 
           by lamps. Heavy steel doors hang along one side. 

                                 ADYE
                        Then why not give up on him? His 
                        soul is hardly worth such 
                        monumental effort.

                                 DR. BREUER
                        It is not to save his soul that I 
                        vork so tirelessly. He is simply 
                        too fascinating to valk away from. 
                        You’ll see, you’ll see.

           He shoos Adye forward as he turns back toward the stairs.

                                 DR. BREUER
                        He is in #9, Inspector. Vithout the 
                        serum that shattered his psyche in 
                        two, Jekyll is just another man, no 
                        stronger than you or me. But Hyde, 
                        Hyde had methods of...expressing
                        his discontent.
           Adye stops, looks back.

                                 ADYE
                        What does that even mean?

           But Breuer has already disappeared up the stairs.

                                 DR. BREUER (O.S.)
                        Only that there are no guards down 
                        here, Inspector. If you have any 
                        problems, you vill have to scream.

           Adye considers that for a beat, uncomfortable. He compensates 
           by fastidiously neatening himself. 

           Noticing mud on his shiny black shoes, he crouches to polish 
           them up with a white, lace-edged handkerchief.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Adye, moving down the hallway, apprehensive despite his usual 
           coolness. He passes two cells, each with heavy metal doors 
           and bars that stretch between 3X6-foot windows. Above the 
           windows, METAL COVERS; beside the windows, LARGE LEVERS.

           In Cell #7, a dim light reveals a chattering MADMAN.

           In Cell #8, no light at all. Someone SNICKERING inside. 

           Finally: Cell #9 is sealed up, its window-cover down. 

                                 ADYE
                        Um, Dr. Henry Jekyll?

           After a beat, from the other side of the door--

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        You’ll have to raise the shutter, 
                        Inspector. I can barely hear you.

           Adye pulls the window’s lever, but immediately skips to the 
           far side of the hall. As far from the cell as he can get.

           Gears GRIND. The window-cover rises.

           Inside, darkness. Adye squints, trying to find Jekyll in it.

                                 ADYE
                        My, ah, my name is Thomas Adye. I’m 
                        an inspector with the Metropolitan 
                        Police Department.

           A hand extends from between bars, offering a handshake.
                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        Pleased to meet you, Tom. I’m 
                        Henry.

           Adye considers the hand for a long moment.

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        Toooom.

           He says this the way someone might, “You’re killing me here.” 
           Adye finally, cautiously, takes the hand and shakes it.

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        See, that wasn’t so hard, was it? 
                        Now you can tell others you shook a 
                        hand that once wiped Satan’s arse.

                                 ADYE
                        You’ll pardon me if I don’t laugh. 

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        Oh dear, they sent me one with his 
                        ass puckered up tighter than the 
                        Virgin Mother’s happy hole. So what 
                        are you after here, Tom? I’m a 
                        busy, busy boy.

           From the cell, the sound of CHAIR LEGS being dragged across 
           the stone floor.

                                 ADYE
                        There, ah, there have been two 
                        murders in Whitechapel--

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        Of whom?

           Adye sets the file he brought on a window tray where food is 
           normally served.

                                 ADYE
                        Prostitutes.

           The file vanishes into the cell and its darkness.

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        Whores. How uninspired. I once knew 
                        a one-legged whore who did this 
                        trick--

                                 ADYE
                        Yes, well...the two murders appear 
                        to have been committed by a man--
                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        A man? Might the attacker not be a 
                        woman, Tom? Perhaps another whore, 
                        perhaps even my one-legged 
                        acquaintance?

           Inside the cell, a match ignites, briefly revealing the 
           deeply shadowed face of JEKYLL. This before Jekyll cups his 
           hand over the match, to light a candle.

           The glimpse unnerves Adye.

                                 ADYE
                        A woman would never be able to 
                        commit such...heinous violence.

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        I do hope you’re going to me more 
                        fun than this, Tom. It’s been so 
                        long since I’ve had any at all, and 
                        will be quite disappointed if you 
                        can’t provide even a modicum of it.

           The candle sits on a small table beside Jekyll, whose arm and 
           the file in his lap are illuminated by its dim glow. Jekyll’s 
           fingers drum the table rhythmically, keeping Adye uneasy.

                                 ADYE
                        The murders, ah, appear to have 
                        been committed by a...person
                        possessed of, I hesitate to say 
                        this...inhuman strength.

           Jekyll leans forward, candlelight catching on longish hair. 
           Revealing a bit of glowering eye.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Ooh, that does sound fun. You may 
                        consider my interest piqued, Tom. 
                        Tell me more.

           As Adye continues, Jekyll flips through the file’s contents.

                                 ADYE
                        He leapt nearly 20 feet. Straight 
                        up. And then climbed another 25 
                        feet up the side of a building.

                                 JEKYLL
                        A regular Spring-Heeled Jack -- oh.

           JEKYLL’S POV: A photo of Martha Tabram’s bloody corpse in the 
           file. It titillates, almost sexually.
                                 JEKYLL
                        How do you think this was 
                        accomplished, Tom?

                                 ADYE
                        I am...uncertain. But your history 
                        suggests a certain familiarity with 
                        preternatural abilities.

                                 JEKYLL
                        And so you've come to the fragile 
                        mental remains of one Dr. Henry 
                        Jekyll for guidance.

           He holds up another bloody photo, barely identifiable in the 
           darkness. Why can’t we get a good glimpse of him?

                                 JEKYLL
                        May I keep this one?

           Adye ignores the disturbing question.

                                 ADYE
                        I, ah, wouldn't call it guidance 
                        that I seek. Guidance is the last 
                        thing I’d want from a creature so 
                        lacking in basic morality.

           Jekyll sits back, shadowed form revealing renewed boredom.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Tom, Tom, Tom. What you call 
                        “morality” is nothing but blind 
                        obedience to words of command. In 
                        all of history, nothing has been as 
                        wholly effective as morality for 
                        leading mankind by the nose. 

                                 ADYE
                        I’d be terrified to consider your 
                        definition of morality.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Was that a query?

                                 ADYE
                        Not in the slightest.

           Jekyll raises a finger, about to make a point.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Very well, I’ll tell you what you 
                        want to know. You want to know, 
                        don’t you, Tom?
                                 ADYE
                        No, truly I do not.

           Jekyll’s hand gesticulates, delicately extending fingers, as 
           if to beckon Adye’s curiosity.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Of course you do. As far as I am 
                        concerned, what is moral is 
                        anything you feel good after the 
                        doing of. On the other hand, what 
                        is immoral is what you feel bad 
                        after. I make it a matter of 
                        principle to never feel bad about 
                        anything I do, and therefore ensure 
                        I will always lead a moral life.

                                 ADYE
                        Your life has been anything but 
                        moral.

                                 JEKYLL
                        By your definition, it most 
                        certainly was. Before 
                        my...spiritual awakening, I was 
                        very much like you.

           Adye turns now; not quite looking away, but making the effort 
           not to face the defiler either. 

                                 ADYE
                        You and I were never alike.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Your pride is adorable, Tom. But 
                        yes, you’re probably right. After 
                        all, I was born a gentleman. You, 
                        on the other hand, most certainly 
                        were not. All your education can’t 
                        mask the, as Darwin would put it, 
                        indelible stamp of your lowly
                        origins.

                                 ADYE
                        What, how?

           Jekyll taps the side of his nose, still wrapped in shadows.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Those of my class just have a nose 
                        for these sorts of things. No 
                        reason to deny it. After all, we 
                        should be able to be honest with 
                        each other if we’re to be chums.
                                 ADYE
                        There is little chance of that.

                                 JEKYLL
                        What, too many mates already? I’d 
                        be surprised at that. You strike me 
                        as the sort other men would try to 
                        avoid. So...

                                 ADYE
                        Good? Decent?

                                 JEKYLL
                        Pompous. Uptight. Bor-ring.

                                 ADYE
                             (becoming defensive)
                        Perfection of moral virtue does not 
                        wholly take away the passions, but 
                        simply regulates them.

           Jekyll slaps the file down on his table and stands.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Gawd, you're so...English. Only 
                        Englishmen think they are moral 
                        when they are uncomfortable.

           Adye gapes for a moment, astonished. He almost laughs.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Your move, Tom. Like it or not, 
                        this is how the Game is played.

                                 ADYE
                        I didn’t come here to play some 
                        game. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        But that’s what your killer is 
                        doing.

           He begins flicking photos at his cell’s bars. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        He’s almost certainly bought bench 
                        seats to the match as well, judging 
                        by these photographs. Nobody goes 
                        to such lengths when taking a life 
                        unless he -- or she -- wants to be 
                        appreciated for it.

           Adye tosses up a hand. Walks away.
                                 ADYE
                        Newcomen was right about you. 
                        You’re a monster.

           Suddenly, Jekyll thrusts HIS FACE against the bars, hands 
           wrapped around them. He’s UNEXPECTEDLY HANDSOME, startlingly 
           so; age, 40s; dark hair, bright blue eyes.

                                 JEKYLL
                        You’ll be back, Tom, take my word 
                        on it! If even a fragment of what 
                        you’ve said is true, you’re going 
                        to need my help! You’ll be back!

           But Adye is confident he won’t be, and keeps walking.

           EXT. BACKYARD - WHITECHAPEL BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

           A humming CARPENTER (20s) pushes open the back door, guided 
           by a lamp. Steps out onto a stoop, overlooking a small yard. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           The carpenter’s lamp has been set next to the rickety five-
           foot-high wood fence that runs between yards, illuminating 
           the carpenter, still humming, as he pisses into grass. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mm...ah...uhhhrr...

           The carpenter looks down at a fraction of broken fence paling 
           -- and the sound he just heard. Stops humming now.

           OVERHEAD (the fence splits the frame like a SPLIT-SCREEN)--

           On the left, the WHITECHAPEL MURDERER atop a new VICTIM. His 
           slicker hides all of her save for knees that he’s wedged 
           between like a lover and a hand holding/grabbing at his back.

           On the right, the carpenter now peeping through the fence. 

                                 VICTIM
                        Uh..hehhh...

           The carpenter, his face cast in orange light and deep 
           shadows, smiles lasciviously at what he thinks are lovers.

                                 CARPENTER
                             (whispers)
                        Good on you, mate. Give ‘er what 
                        you got.

           The carpenter heads back toward the boarding house, humming. 
           Lamp swinging in his hand as if not a care in the world.
           EXT. BACKYARD - WHITECHAPEL BOARDING HOUSE #2 - CONT'D

           The Murderer reaches down toward his victim’s abdomen. Pulls 
           on something OS that won’t give. 

                                 VICTIM
                        Uhh...Gahhh...ddd...

           Pulls again, and this time whatever it is comes--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - WHITECHAPEL BOARDING HOUSE #2 - DAY

           A SLAB OF RAW PORK lands on a wood chopping board. 

           A FEMALE TENANT holds a large knife over it, but is 
           distracted by the sight of a DOZEN OR MORE CONSTABLES AND 
           INSPECTORS milling about her boarding house’s backyard.

                                 FEMALE TENANT
                        Tillie, will you look at this? 
                        Bloody peelers look like they’re 
                        ‘aving a party in the yard.

           Her knife drops down, cutting deep into the pork.

           EXT. BACKYARD - WHITECHAPEL BOARDING HOUSE #2 - CONT'D

           CLOSE on the fence and a bloody hand print made in the last 
           moments of life, smeared down to the hand that made it.

           Adye kneels beside the corpse. The woman’s knees are still up 
           in the air; left arm lies awkwardly over her left breast.

                                 ADYE
                        Prostitute. Mid-40s. Same as the 
                        other two, including the blade-
                        work.

           Behind him stand Newcomen and Constable Tamberly.

                                 ADYE
                        The killer’s methodology is 
                        evolving. He’s taking greater care, 
                        confident he’ll be allowed to ply 
                        his trade here in Whitechapel 
                        without interruption. 

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Christ. This is going to get worse, 
                        isn’t it?

           He holds a handkerchief to his mouth, nauseated. Points down.
                                 NEWCOMEN
                        What is that?

                                 ADYE
                        Her intestines, sir. And no, they 
                        don’t belong on the outside.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Must you be so blase? Doesn’t any 
                        of this...violence sicken you?

           Adye looks up, distracted by a WHITECHAPEL MOTHER and her SON 
           (8) standing on the stoop, watching the investigation.

                                 ADYE
                             (absently)
                        Unquantifiably so.

           FLASHBACK - EXT. STOOP - WHITECHAPEL BOARDING HOUSE #3 - DAY

           A YOUNG ADYE (8 or so) sits on a stoop similar to the one 
           Adye was looking at in 1888. A BUSINESSMAN exits the house, 
           looks impersonally at him, and leaves via the steps.

           ADYE’S MOTHER (30s), clearly a prostitute, steps outside 
           next. She smiles lovingly at Adye.

                                 ADYE’S MOTHER
                        It’s all arranged, Tommy. You’ll be 
                        going to live with your pa now.

                                 YOUNG ADYE
                        Me pa?

                                 ADYE’S MOTHER
                        He’ll be giving you a proper 
                        education, be making something of 
                        you. You’ll never have to come back 
                        here, never.

           Young Adye is confused, maybe even scared at that.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. STREET - WHITECHAPEL BOARDING HOUSE #2

           REPORTERS surround a police brougham, into which Newcomen is 
           climbing. Adye stands next to the door, holding the pressing 
           mob back with the help of Constable Red-Face.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Mr. Chief Inspector, when can we 
                        expect an arrest? 
                                 NEWCOMEN
                        The Whitechapel Murderer--

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Is that how you’re calling him now?

           Newcomen curses under his breath at the slip. 

                                 REPORTER #3
                        What do you say to frightened 
                        Londoners? 

           Newcomen leans close to Adye, from inside the brougham. 

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        I ‘ired you coz you claimed your 
                        modern methods could help clean up 
                        this cesspool. Don’t fail me, son. 
                        The mob can be vicious.

           The brougham pulls away, leaving Adye to consider Newcomen’s 
           words. The journalists surge past him, still shouting.

                                 REPORTER #4
                        Do you think the Whitechapel 
                        Murderer a pervert?! Was the victim 
                        mutilated like the others?!

                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                             (to Adye)
                        What’s ‘e, think you’re Scotland 
                        Yard’s savior?

           Adye answers distractedly, eyes on the crowd.

                                 ADYE
                        I pray I am, Constable.

           From within the crowd, we spot the Murderer’s top hat. His 
           raised collar. He’s there, observing the fallout of his 
           handiwork -- and Adye has noticed him.

                                 JEKYLL (V.O.)
                        He’s almost certainly bought bench 
                        seats to the match as well. Nobody 
                        goes to such lengths when stealing 
                        a life unless he -- or she -- wants 
                        to be appreciated for it.

           Adye’s eyes narrow. He raises a hand and calls out--

                                 ADYE
                        You there, in the top hat. I’d like 
                        to ask you a few questions.
           The Murderer tips his hat as bodies pass before him, 
           partially obscuring him as he ducks into the crowd.

                                 ADYE
                        Stop, I say!

           OVERHEAD: Adye runs into the crowd, the Murderer well ahead 
           of him. So close, but so far away.

                                 ADYE
                        Stop! Stop that man!

           Two constables, one being Whinger, notice Adye shouting 
           inexplicably at somebody they can’t see themselves. 

                                 CONSTABLE WHINGER
                        He’s an odd duck, don’t you think?

           EXT. WHITECHAPEL - CONT'D

           A couple blocks away, Adye has fallen 30 feet behind the 
           Murderer who’s descending steps into the LONDON UNDERGROUND.

                                 ADYE
                        Stop! 

           INT. TRAIN STATION - LONDON UNDERGROUND - CONT'D

           Adye shoves his way through COMMUTERS, trying to reach a 
           STOPPED TRAIN that the Murderer is boarding.

                                 ADYE
                        Metropolitan Police, move, damnit!

           INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING CAR - TRAIN - CONT'D

           Adye stumbles onto the train as the doors close behind him. 

                                 ADYE
                        Which way did he go?

           Well-heeled GENTLEMEN -- cigars, pipes, tumblers of brandy in 
           hand -- gape at the disruption through wafting smoke. 

                                 GENTLEMAN #1
                        I say, this is quite unusual.

                                 GENTLEMAN #2
                        Explain yourself immediately.

           Adye draws his revolver as the train begins to move.
                                 ADYE
                        I said, which way did he go?! A man 
                        in black, face masked by a, a sort 
                        of collar.

           Every gentleman immediately points toward the forward door. 

           INT. FIRST CLASS WOMEN’S CAR - TRAIN - CONT'D

           Adye emerges into the women’s car that would be a bit less 
           opulent than a smoking car. GENTLEWOMEN gasp.

                                 GENTLEWOMAN #1
                        Oh my.

                                 GENTLEWOMAN #2
                        He’s got a gun.

                                 GENTLEWOMAN #3
                        It’s quite large, isn’t it?

           Adye double takes the strange comment.

           INT. THIRD CLASS CAR - TRAIN - CONT'D

           Adye emerges into a third-class car, WORKING CLASS FOLKS 
           packed in like sardines. He scans their indifferent faces.

           Suddenly, the Murderer explodes from within the bodies, 
           shoving Adye’s upper-body THROUGH A WINDOW. 

           Commuters fall back, screaming.

           Adye’s head sticks out the window, held there by two great, 
           hirsute hands trying to choke the life out of him. 

           A light indicates an ONCOMING TRAIN.

           Adye looks up at the Murderer’s masked face. YELLOW-FLECKED 
           EYES, filled with rage, glare back at him.

           The oncoming train is now visible.

           Adye manages to lift his revolver up -- the barrel about to 
           find the Murderer’s head.

           The oncoming train will momentarily decapitate Adye.

           The Murderer falls away from Adye and the revolver, shoving 
           his way back into the crowd. 

           Adye lifts his head, just as the other train and its lights 
           pass/thunder by outside.
           EXT. BETWEEN CARS - TRAIN - CONT'D

           The Murderer slams a door behind him. Rips off the handle.

           INT. THIRD CLASS CAR #2 - TRAIN - CONT'D

           Pushing through COMMUTERS, Adye, reaches the first of two 
           doors to the conductor’s car -- but it’s jammed!

           Through the doors’ windows, he sees the Murderer throw the 
           CONDUCTOR through the front window. 

           INT. CONDUCTOR’S CAR - TRAIN - CONT'D

           The dead conductor lies folded over the car’s broken window, 
           sparks from the track flying up over him to whip about the 
           Murderer who’s REACHING FOR A LEVER.

           INT. THIRD CLASS CAR #2 - TRAIN - CONT'D

           Adye fires THREE TIMES with his revolver, shattering windows.

                                 ADYE
                        NOOOOOOO!!

           INT. CONDUCTOR’S CAR - TRAIN - CONT'D

           The Murderer absorbs the impact of at least two of those 
           shots into his back as the lever completely flips. 

           The train around him SHAKES, the BRAKES LOCKED now.

           EXT. TRAIN TUNNEL - CONT'D

           The conductor’s car twists off the track in a CLANGING 
           CACOPHONY, forcing Adye’s car to begin derailing. Sparks fly.

           INT. THIRD CLASS CAR #2 - TRAIN - CONT'D

           Adye’s head SMASHES INTO THE WALL in front of him, his 
           revolver flying from his hand--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           BLACK

           After a long silence--

                                 VOICES (O.S.)
                        Help! Somebody help us, please!

           SLOWLY FADE IN:
           INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Adye comes to. Vague shapes suggest he’s upside down.

                                 VOICES (O.S.)
                        Oh God, Frank! Frank! My baby! 
                        Where’s my baby?!

           Adye, blood running down his face from a head wound, crawls 
           from the wreckage of the train. Devastation all around him. 
           Fires. Some bodies. COMMUTERS stumbling about.

           And there, running away along the twisted train -- THE 
           WHITECHAPEL MURDERER. He bounds effortlessly between cars.

                                 INJURED COMMUTER
                        Please, sir, help...

           Adye watches as the Murderer leaps 20 FEET STRAIGHT UP toward 
           the tunnel’s roof...definitely not a mere human.

           The Murderer has reached an ACCESS SHAFT, and disappears up 
           it as Adye tries to make sense of all this.

                                 ADYE
                        What manner of monster is this?

           INT. BLACK MUSEUM - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           An open door’s frosted window reads EVIDENCE STORAGE, but 
           what’s inside looks a hell of a lot more like a museum -- 
           which is why it was (and still is) called the BLACK MUSEUM. 

           Artifacts from England’s greatest crimes are on display. 
           Common weapons like wrenches, as well as unique ones like an 
           umbrella shotgun and the elephant gun that took down Hyde.

           Adye -- bandage on his forehead, lip cut -- studies several 
           DEATH MASKS hung on the wall. Reaches out to touch one when--

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                        Don’t do that.

           A CLERK (40s; an impatient, rude scarecrow of a man) enters.

                                 ADYE 
                        My apologies. 

           He notices the clerk’s hands are empty.

                                 ADYE
                        Dr. Jekyll’s research, where is it?
                                 CLERK
                        The file you requested is missing. 

                                 ADYE
                        Missing? But that evidence is vital 
                        to my case. To saving lives. Who 
                        checked it out last?

                                 CLERK
                        The pertinent log book is...missing
                        as well. 

                                 ADYE
                        But isn’t it your job to keep track 
                        of these things?

                                 CLERK
                        We live in the world’s largest 
                        metropolis. I can’t be expected to 
                        account for every knickknack and 
                        scrap of paper left here. 

           He sweeps out, having had enough.

                                 CLERK
                        Such a task would require German 
                        efficiency, and I am not German!

           Adye is left without options now, and he knows it.

           INT. DUNGEON - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           Jekyll, in prison greys and slippers, is eating eggs and 
           toast at his cell’s table -- lit by a bright lamp this time.

                                 JEKYLL
                        How does one expect a man to eat 
                        eggs without utensils? It’s 
                        downright inhuman, if you ask me.

           Outside the cell: Adye, bowler in hand, watches Jekyll wipe 
           up eggs with a half-slice of toast. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        I take it you’ve concluded you need 
                        me after all, Tom?

                                 ADYE
                        I...yes, I require your assistance.

           Jekyll stands so suddenly that his chair topples backwards. 
           He slaps a hand down on his desk, overturning a cup of water.
                                 JEKYLL
                        Well, why didn’t you say so?! Of 
                        course you can count on me, Tom. 
                        After all, we’re mates now-- 

                                 ADYE
                        We’re not mates. Listen, Doctor, I 
                        saw him. The Murderer. 

           Jekyll steps closer, indicating Adye’s forehead bandage with 
           a piece of his yolk-soaked toast.

                                 JEKYLL
                        You did more than see him, judging 
                        by that nasty bump. 

                                 ADYE
                        I shot him as well, I’m certain of 
                        it, even if the bullets seemed to 
                        have no effect on him. 

                                 JEKYLL
                             (chewing on toast)
                        Oh, I assure you they did. Myself, 
                        I felt every one, even if my serum 
                        blunted the pain in the moment. 
                        Tell me more.

                                 ADYE
                        He was possessed of prodigious 
                        strength, and threw me about as if 
                        I were a child. I was certain I was 
                        going to die.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Are you afraid of death then, Tom?

                                 ADYE
                        Let’s stay focused on the case.

           Jekyll considers Adye, chomping on his toast. Then--

                                 JEKYLL
                        Of course you’re not. Heaven and 
                        its golden towers are awaiting you, 
                        how could they not be?

                                 ADYE
                        You mock God?

                                 JEKYLL
                        Religion is regarded by the common 
                        people as true, by the wise as 
                        false, and by rulers as useful.
                                 ADYE
                        Seneca. You’re quoting Seneca.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Very good, Tom, very good indeed.

           Jekyll takes the other half of his toast from his plate. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        Yours if you want it.

           Adye shakes his head. This is all so off-putting for him.

                                 JEKYLL
                        It’d be really lovely with some 
                        nice marmalade, but, ah, that would 
                        require a utensil to apply, now 
                        wouldn’t it? 
                             (shouts down the hall)
                        YOU INHUMAN BASTARDS! 
                             (to Adye, calm again)
                        Anything else, Tom?

                                 ADYE
                        Uh, tissue taken from beneath the 
                        fingernails of the Murderer’s third 
                        victim, drawn from her attacker as 
                        she fought for her life no doubt, 
                        displayed some...unusual qualities.  

                                 JEKYLL
                        So you went to the Black Museum, to 
                        compare your sample with my serum. 
                        To evince a link between them.

           Adye, confused. How could Jekyll know that? 

                                 JEKYLL
                        It’s only reasonable. Unfortunately 
                        for you, my case file has 
                        disappeared along with my research 
                        and the serum that was seized 
                        following my arrest. 
                             (proud)
                        My work was considered dangerous to 
                        many. I always knew it would be 
                        suppressed. 

                                 ADYE
                        Whatever you say. Can you offer any 
                        solutions to my...dilemma?
                                 JEKYLL
                        Such as, say, access to samples of 
                        the serum I might have hidden away 
                        on the off-chance that, someday, I 
                        might be released from this 
                        miserable dungeon?

                                 ADYE
                             (suddenly hopeful)
                        You have more it?

                                 JEKYLL
                        Several vials in fact, of a latter 
                        variation that can be imbibed 
                        orally rather than intravenously. 

                                 ADYE
                        Where? Tell me!

                                 JEKYLL
                        You believe my serum can help you 
                        find your whore killer? 

                                 ADYE
                        Yes, yes.

                                 JEKYLL
                        And without it, your whore killer 
                        will no doubt continue killing
                        whores unthwarted?

           Adye blanches at how he walked into Jekyll’s trap.

           INT. NEWCOMEN’S OFFICE - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           Newcomen rages, shouting at Adye and, behind him, Dr. Breuer.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        I told you to stay away from him, 
                        goddamnit! You deliberately 
                        disobeyed a direct order!

                                 ADYE
                        It would only for one day, Chief 
                        Inspector. 

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        You have no idea what that, that
                        thing is capable of.

                                 DR. BREUER 
                        Not very much without his serum, 
                        not very much I assure you. 
           Newcomen blusters. Struggling with his good sense.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        This is madness.

                                 ADYE
                        It’s our best chance to find the 
                        Murderer, sir. How many more must 
                        die while we sit on our hands?

           Newcomen looks over at the framed newspaper on his wall.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Twelve men that day, Adye. Twelve.

           INT. HALLWAY - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           Jekyll, shuffling, is led by Constables Tamberly and Red-Face 
           toward an open door. Wrists and ankles shackled, a chain 
           between these linked through a loop on a leather vest. 

           Adye, who carries a satchel-like “briefcase,” and a police 
           wagon wait outside. 

                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                        Pick up the pace, Doctor. 

                                 ADYE
                        Is there a problem?

                                 JEKYLL
                        I don’t mean to be a nuisance, Tom, 
                        but...well...

           He tries to lift his shackled wrists to shield his eyes from 
           the light, but the span of chain connected to his ankles 
           won’t allow him to without hunching over.

                                 JEKYLL
                        It’s the sun. It’s been some time 
                        since I last saw it.

           Adye’s eyes reveal a moment of sympathy.

           EXT. ALLEY - SCOTLAND YARD - CONT'D

           Jekyll shuffles into an alley and peers up from under Adye’s 
           satchel that’s helping to shield his eyes, squinting with 
           teary eyes at the sun shining on him. Half-smiling. 

           There’s nothing scary about him at first glance in the light 
           of day. If anything, he looks a bit tragic.
                                 JEKYLL
                        “The sun, too, shines into 
                        cesspools, and is not polluted.”  

           The constables help Jekyll into the cab of the wagon as Adye 
           now looks up at the sun, too, wondering after the beauty 
           Jekyll obviously found there.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Are you coming, Tom? 

           EXT. JEKYLL’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

           OVERHEAD SHOT: Five year’s after Hyde’s capture, the house is 
           a ghost of its former self. Windows boarded up. Wild cats. 
           The roof collapsing around the hole a constable made there.

                                 JEKYLL (PRE-LAP)
                        I was born here. My fiancee 
                        Millicent and I looked forward to 
                        raising our own children under its 
                        roof. Now look at what it’s become.

           Through that hole: movement.

           INT. JEKYLL’S HOUSE - CONT'D

           Jekyll gazes about at the moldering ruins of his former life. 
           Adye and the two constables nearby, ready for anything.

                                 ADYE
                        Dr. Breuer said you bashed her head 
                        in with a clock.

           Jekyll pauses, as if remember. Half-smiles.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Ah, yes. I did indeed. 
                             (beat)
                        Things weren’t supposed to turn out 
                        that way. I was, if you’d believe 
                        it, trying to cure what you would 
                        call evil. 

           Adye snorts.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Suppress it, actually. A chemical 
                        inhibitor of certain impulses.

                                 ADYE
                        You played God. 

           Those words resonate with Jekyll--
           FLASHBACK - INT. SMOKING PARLOR - JEKYLL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Five years ago. Jekyll, his demeanor timid compared to him in 
           the present of our movie, debates with Utterson and other 
           GENTLEMEN. All wear tuxes; hold cigars and brandy snifters.

                                 UTTERSON
                        These scientific heresies must 
                        stop, Henry.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. JEKYLL’S HOUSE

           Jekyll looks back at Adye.

                                 JEKYLL
                        What did Cicero say the function of 
                        wisdom is, Tom?

                                 ADYE
                        To distinguish between that which 
                        is God’s work and that which is 
                        Satan’s. Precisely my point--

                                 JEKYLL
                        No, you’re mistaken. He said
                        between good and evil, making no 
                        reference, no reference at all to 
                        gods and monsters. That’s because a 
                        supernatural source of evil is not 
                        necessary. Men alone are quite 
                        capable of every wickedness, which 
                        begs the question... 
                             (smirks)
                        How can it be in our nature, in my 
                        nature, to be evil? Nothing is evil 
                        which is according to nature, after 
                        all.

                        Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Is this 
                        how you did it? How you justified 
                        the laws of men and nature you 
                        disregarded, with philosophical 
                        equivocations?

                                 JEKYLL
                        Try to get through a day without 
                        two or three juicy equivocations, 
                        Tom. It’s quite impossible. 

           Tamberly and Red-Face gape at Adye and Jekyll for a beat, 
           confused by all the big words and philosophy.

                                                               BACK TO:

           FLASHBACK - INT. SMOKING PARLOR - JEKYLL’S HOUSE

           Jekyll continues to debate with Utterson and his colleagues.

                                 UTTERSON
                        Have you never noticed that most of 
                        the evil in this world is the 
                        direct result of some fool 
                        mistaking power for wisdom? Noble 
                        intentions may do as much harm as 
                        wickedness if they lack 
                        understanding.

                                 JEKYLL
                        But my only wish is to relieve 
                        sorrow and suffering. Surely you 
                        must appreciate that, John?

                                 UTTERSON
                        Yes, but your virtue would not go 
                        to such lengths if vanity did not 
                        keep it company. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. JEKYLL’S HOUSE

           Jekyll almost smiles at the memory.

                                 ADYE
                        What is it?

                                 JEKYLL
                        You just remind me of an old 
                        friend, that’s all.

           INT. CELLAR LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Tangles of dust and webs hang like moss from and between the 
           beakers, tubes, and equipment that covers several long 
           tables. Typical not-quite-mad-but-mad-enough scientist stuff.

           The sight saddens Jekyll. Adye and the constables watch him.

                                 JEKYLL
                        I used to all but live down here, 
                        desperate to save the world.

                                 JEKYLL (CONT'D)
                        Something, I’m sure, you can 
                        empathize with, Tom.

           He runs his hand over a dissecting table, sweeping a handful 
           of dust away. From the past, an AGONIZED HUMAN SCREAM reaches 
           his ears.

                                 JEKYLL
                        This is where Hyde was born. 
                        Where...

           His voice trails off, before he shakes the memory away.

                                 JEKYLL
                        It’s really quite remarkable, my 
                        serum. I’d been working on it for 
                        years before I finally stumbled 
                        across the catalyst. Adrenaline. 
                        Human adrenaline. Oh, there’s 
                        nothing quite like it, Tom. The 
                        rush it gives. But cadavers could 
                        provide so little of it.

           The constables listen as if to a ghost story.

                                 JEKYLL
                        After a while, there was no choice 
                        but to turn to living sources. 
                        That’s how it began, the killing. 
                        Almost certainly it’s how it began 
                        for your Murderer, as well. Fear 
                        mass produces it in the body, you 
                        see. That’s why he takes his time, 
                        to harvest as much as he can.

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        That doesn’t explain why he has to 
                        slice those women up like he does.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Oh no, Constable. That’s for the 
                        fun of it. 

                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                             (gulps)
                        Fun?

           Adye shines a lamp on Jekyll, disgusted.

                                 ADYE
                        You knew what Hyde was doing and 
                        yet you continued to administer the 
                        serum. That makes you culpable.
                                 JEKYLL
                        Even without it, he was eventually 
                        able to creep into my 
                        consciousness. There was no 
                        escaping him, I assure you.

                                 ADYE
                        Cyanide would’ve done the trick, 
                        and saved a number of lives.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Alas, I am a Christian and do not 
                        believe in self-immolation.

           He clumsily makes the sign of the cross with shackled hands.

                                 ADYE
                        You’re no Christian.

                                 JEKYLL
                        And you’re no God, yet you judge 
                        with the arrogance of one. 

           Adye is silenced for a moment by that. Squirms.

                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                             (still disturbed)
                        For the fun of it?

                                 ADYE
                             (sighs)
                        Where’s the serum, Doctor?

                                                                CUT TO:

           The constables use crowbars to pry a shelf away from the 
           wall. It topples forward, web-covered books and scientific 
           equipment spilling off. 

           Adye, with Jekyll at his side, shines a lamp on the newly 
           exposed wall -- and the HIDDEN SAFE there.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INSIDE THE SAFE: Blackness. A combination lock CLICKING.

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        Let’s see if I remember the 
                        combination. Click, click, clickety-
                        click...bingo!

           Jekyll opens the door, light slowly revealing papers...and 
           FOUR CAPPED VIALS filled with YELLOW SERUM that glows dimly.
           One of these is rolling forward.

           Adye’s eyes bulge with panic as the vial topples out.

           His hand lashes out...and the vial topples, end over end, 
           past his fingertips.

           Right into the palm of one of Jekyll’s shackled hands.

           Jekyll stands upright, calmly watching as the two constables 
           lift their nightsticks, prepared to club him. 

           Adye reflexively draws his revolver from his jacket.

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        Hand it over, Doctor!

           CLOSE on Jekyll’s hands. His thumb slowly, slowly unscrewing 
           the cap. We can even hear the SQUEAK of this.

                                 ADYE
                        Don’t do it, Doctor.

           Adye has his revolver halfway up, not quite aiming it. He 
           knows what it would mean if Jekyll took even one sip.

                                 ADYE
                        Please.

           Jekyll...slowly smiles.

           And then, anti-climactically given the tension he’s just 
           created, spins the vial around in his fingers like a coin and 
           holds it out to Adye.

           Adye can’t hide his confusion at Jekyll’s willingness to 
           cooperate, and cautiously reaches for the vial...before 
           snatching it away.

           He reaches into the safe to claim the other three, as well.

                                 JEKYLL
                        It’s more fun this way, trust me. 
                        You do trust me, don’t you?

                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                        Why’s he still going on about 
                        having fun? There’s nothing fun 
                        about this. I ain’t having fun.

                                 ADYE
                        What game are you playing, Doctor?
                                 JEKYLL
                        The only one that matters, Tom.

           EXT. JEKYLL’S HOUSE - LATER

           Adye walks from the house, sliding the last of the vials into 
           a pocket cigar case that he’ll slip into his jacket.

                                 ADYE
                        Load him up.

           At the curb, the constables guide Jekyll toward the police 
           wagon door. Jekyll takes one last longing look at the nearby 
           buildings and, all around, London.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Tell me, Tom, how many names 
                        currently occupy your potential 
                        suspects dossier? 

                                 ADYE
                             (sighs)
                        Fifty-two, why?

                                 JEKYLL
                        Well, I’ve had myself a thought.  

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        It’d be best if you didn’t think at 
                        all, Doctor. It’s dangerous.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Nevertheless-- 
                             (to Tom)
                        --I can help you. I know the minds 
                        of the men inside that dossier of 
                        yours. More to the point, I know 
                        the mind of the man you’re after. 

                                 ADYE
                        I know how criminals think.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Very well, hypothesize what I am 
                        presently thinking.

           Adye’s brow furrows slightly.

                                 ADYE
                        You’re about to offer further 
                        assistance in the Whitechapel 
                        Murders case...as long as I don’t 
                        return you to Scotland Yard right 
                        away. Am I correct?
           Jekyll is not amused. His shackled wrists lift, so his open 
           hands can suggest size.

                                 JEKYLL
                        No. I was thinking about breasts. 
                        Not large ones, mind you. Average 
                        breasts, and freckled. I have a 
                        think for pale women, if you must 
                        know.

           The two constables try not to laugh. Jekyll climbs into the 
           wagon by himself, grinning.

                                 JEKYLL
                        But I accept your amended deal. To 
                        Whitechapel, driver. The good 
                        inspector requires a lesson in how 
                        to properly find himself a maniac. 

           Adye looks frustrated. The constables hesitate.

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        Shall we be doing as the doctor 
                        says, Inspector?

           INT. POLICE WAGON - DAY

           On Adye’s lap, an open file. A photo of a criminal on top.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Not that one. You won’t be looking 
                        for a kiddie fiddler.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Another file, another photo. Jekyll points at the photo.

                                 JEKYLL
                        This bloke’s a poofter. Forget him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Another file, another photo. Jekyll’s hand dismisses it.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Your whores weren’t raped, Tom. 

                                 ADYE
                        But Annie Chapman’s sexual organs 
                        were removed. Perhaps--

                                 JEKYLL
                        The Murderer sought to enjoy her 
                        post-mortem?

                                 JEKYLL (CONT'D)
                        Now you’re thinking like a good and 
                        proper villain, Tom...but no, not 
                        here.

           Adye sits back, considering Jekyll.

                                 ADYE
                        Do you enjoy the dark places your 
                        mind can peer? 

                                 JEKYLL
                        Why yes, very much. 

           That frightens Adye most of all. The constables cringe.

           EXT. STREET - WHITECHAPEL - LATER

           A PROSTITUTE waves Adye’s question-asking off, walking away.

           The police wagon is parked at the curb, Jekyll watching Adye 
           from the window. Amused. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        I told you, Tom, they won’t talk to 
                        peelers. Least not peelers like 
                        you. And especially not if you keep 
                        calling them prostitutes and ma’am. 

                                 ADYE
                        I don’t want to be disrespectful.

                                 JEKYLL
                        They’re whores!

           EXT. THE TEN BELLS - LATER

           Adye stands outside a windowed public house (pub), looking up 
           at a sign that hangs over the door: THE TEN BELLS.

                                 ADYE
                        Annie Chapman was a regular here. 

           Behind him, inside the police wagon: Jekyll sets his shackled 
           wrists on the window sill, indifferent to how PASSING PEOPLE 
           can see them. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        Do you think you could fetch me a 
                        nice pie while you’re in there? I’m 
                        famished.
                             (beat)
                        Kidney, please.

           Adye, incredulous. Red-Face half raises his hand.
                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                        I could eat as well, if you don’t 
                        mind, sir.

           INT. THE TEN BELLS - MOMENTS LATER

           A busy, but not packed pub. Adye makes his way through it, 
           searching the faces of PATRONS for what he’s after.

           At the back, he finds three prostitutes: one with a BLOODY 
           MOUTH she’s holding an equally bloody handkerchief against, 
           Netty, and, her back to Adye, Mary Jane. 

                                 BLOODY MOUTH
                        So there I am, bent over this 
                        crate, this daft prick going at me 
                        whilst ‘is mates watch, when who 
                        should stroll up? Father Flattery.

           Netty looks squeamish at the story being told, clearly a 
           newcomer to the flesh-peddling trade.

                                 MARY JANE
                        He didn’t!

                                 BLOODY MOUTH
                        ‘E did! ‘E told me I ‘ad the devil 
                        in me, and I said, “I’d’a wagered 
                        ‘e’d ‘ave been bigger,” him being 
                        the devil and all. 

           Adye squirms prudishly at the story, still unnoticed.

                                 NETTY
                        What, what happened next?

                                 BLOODY MOUTH
                        The bloke behind me, ‘is mates 
                        laughed at what I said, so ‘e 
                        bashed me in the mouth. Knocked a 
                        tooth out, too, the bastard did.

           She pulls her hanky away, revealing a gap in her bloody-
           covered teeth. Laughs hysterically at this.

                                 ADYE
                        P-Pardon me. Ah, are you whores?

           The three prostitutes turn. 

                                 MARY JANE
                        You’re a bloody genius, aren’t you?

           Bloody Mouth spits on the ground, then addresses her friends.
                                 BLOODY MOUTH
                        I’m knackered. ‘E’s all yours.

           Netty looks hesitant. Mary Jane smiles sweetly at her.

                                 MARY JANE
                        I’ll take ‘im. Don’t worry, supper 
                        will be me treat.

           She turns to Adye. With an exhausted, maybe even bored tone--

                                 MARY JANE
                        Name’s Mary Jane, mate. Let’s get 
                        this over with, all right? 

           EXT. ALLEY - THE TEN BELLS - MOMENTS LATER

           A dank alley, from which Christ Church is visible. Adye 
           places a coin in Mary Jane’s extended hand.

                                 ADYE
                        Will that do?

           She hikes up her dress, drops to her stockinged knees on wet 
           cobblestones. All business. Adye looks embarrassed by this.

                                 ADYE
                        Yes, I suppose so.

                                 MARY JANE
                        You’re going to want to pull the 
                        beast out, I don’t have all day.

                                 ADYE
                        I, ah, was actually rather hoping 
                        to ask you a question or two.

           He squirms as she tries to open his trousers, one hand 
           already feeling up his crotch.

                                 MARY JANE
                        Long as you don’t expect me to be 
                        answering you. I’m going to be a 
                        wee busy, you see.

                                 ADYE
                        No, no, that’s not what I mean. 

           He lifts her back to her feet, his cheeks flush. 

                                 ADYE
                        Listen, you’re free to keep the 
                        money in trade for answering a few 
                        questions.
                                 MARY JANE
                        Shite, you’re a copper, ain’t you? 

                                 ADYE
                        It’s not like that. I’m looking for 
                        help, finding the Whitechapel 
                        Murderer.

           She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, thinking.

                                 MARY JANE
                        What do you want with me?

                                 ADYE
                        I’ve got a few names, men of 
                        interest I suppose you’d call them. 
                        Men perhaps you’d be familiar with. 

           She’s still hesitant.

                                 ADYE
                        Ma’am, women in your profession, 
                        women like you, are being targeted. 
                        You could be next.

           She smiles girlisly at something he just said.

                                 MARY JANE
                        You called me ma’am.

                                 ADYE
                        I...apologize.

                                 MARY JANE
                        No, I rather liked it. Don’t ‘ear 
                        it too often, I don’t. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Adye reads from his pocket notebook as Mary Jane scratches at 
           her neck and side as if bothered by lice or a rash. She 
           shakes her head at each name.

                                 ADYE
                        Martin Donovan. Maurice Whitaker. 
                        Oscar Lacey. John Pizer--

                                 MARY JANE
                        That’s your bloke! Right bent Jew 
                        ‘e is. Gave Maggie a good bashing 
                        in, Gawd, May and, last month, 
                        slashed Frances up ‘n down ‘er
                        collars with a pen knife, ‘e did. 
                                 ADYE
                        Does that sort of thing happen to 
                        you girls often?

                                 MARY JANE
                        Let us say, it’s not a career 
                        choice for those of us with any 
                        other choices to be made.

           Adye looks sadly at her, heart disappointed by such reality.

                                 MARY JANE
                        ‘Is brother’s Christian Bob, ‘oo’s
                        an even scarier bastard.  

                                 ADYE
                        He runs the gutta percha factory 
                        near the river, doesn’t he?

                                 MARY JANE
                        And whatever else ‘e can get ‘is 
                        ‘ands on. Fancies ‘imself a 
                        gangster, this one does. 
                             (beat, serious)
                        You don’t want to go anywhere near 
                        ‘im, Inspector.

           EXT. GUTTA PERCHA FACTORY - DUSK

           A gutta percha (RUBBER) factory on the edge of Whitechapel. 
           Thick black smoke rises from several chimneys. 

           The police wagon has stopped at a distance, where Adye is 
           double-checking the rounds in his revolver. The constables 
           stand next to the door; Jekyll still seated inside.

                                 CONSTABLE TAMBERLY
                        You shouldn’t go in there alone.

                                 JEKYLL
                        I’d be more than willing to escort 
                        you, Tom. 

           Adye points at Jekyll, speaking to the constables--

                                 ADYE
                        Do not take your eyes off of him, 
                        do you hear me? I’ll be fine.

           Jekyll almost smiles, skeptical of that.
           INT. WORK FLOOR - GUTTA PERCHA FACTORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Adye enters through a heavy door, the world around him hazy 
           with smoke and heat.

                                 ADYE
                        Pardon me, I’m, ah, I’m seeking a 
                        John Pizer. He also goes by the 
                        name Leather Apron.

           Vats of bubbling rubber, fiery vents, and smoking furnaces 
           everywhere. FOUR SCARY EMPLOYEES/THUGS turn away from their 
           work at Adye’s intrusion, two with large pipes in hand.

           TWO MORE on elevated walkways turn to watch what happens.

                                 ADYE
                        Your Christian Bob will do.

                                 BALD GIANT
                        You’re not welcome here, son.

                                 ADYE
                        I don’t think you understand. I’m 
                        Inspector Thomas Adye with the 
                        Metropolitan Police--

                                 WRENCH-WIELDING AFRICAN
                        He said, GET OUT!

           INT. POLICE WAGON - MOMENTS LATER

           Jekyll sits across from the constables, singing a drinking 
           song with Red-Face who’s clearly fallen for his charms.

                                 JEKYLL
                        “Now I once had a gal, her hair was 
                        red/Twas curly all over except on 
                        her head.”

                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                        “Wake her, shake her/Wake that gal 
                        with the blue dress on.”

                                 JEKYLL
                        “Her eyes was blue, her dress the 
                        same/But she always fell asleep 
                        before I came.”

           Red-Face gives Tamberly an elbow, so Tamberly joins in.

                                 CONSTABLES RED-FACE & TAMBERLY
                        “Wake her, shake her/Wake that gal 
                        with the blue dress on.”
                                 JEKYLL
                        “Them Hilo girls all dress so 
                        fine/But they ain’t got Jesus on 
                        their minds.”

           Tamberly joins in more enthusiastically this time.

                                 CONSTABLES RED-FACE & TAMBERLY
                        “Wake her, shake her/Wake that gal 
                        with the blue dress on--”

           The constables go white at the sight of something outside.

                                 CONSTABLE RED-FACE
                        Bloody hell.

           Adye stalks up to the police wagon. His shoulder sleeve 
           partially torn. The bowler cap on his head dented in in two 
           places. Eyelid cut from a blow.

                                 JEKYLL
                             (laughs)
                        I warned you, Tom. The police have 
                        no real power in Whitechapel, least 
                        not against the villains who call 
                        this beautiful cesspool home.

           Adye removes his bowler, pops it back into place. Trying to 
           remain calm despite embarrassment and simmering rage.

                                 ADYE
                        I am an inspector of Scotland Yard. 
                        Those men have no...respect for 
                        authority.

                                 JEKYLL
                        No doubt children of liberal 
                        parents all. I’d wager none of them 
                        have ever known a good...thrashing.

           Adye looks up at Jekyll’s subtle suggestion, something 
           clicking in his mind.

           INT. WORK FLOOR - GUTTA PERCHA FACTORY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Bald Giant looks over his shoulder--

                                 BALD GIANT
                        Look oo’s back, boys. ‘E’s brought 
                        some mates, too.

           Several thugs, THREE MORE than we last counted, gather to 
           confront Adye, Jekyll (still shackled, but grinning 
           wickedly), and the two constables who have just entered.
           The presence of reinforcements, especially Jekyll, has put 
           some cockiness in Adye’s smile and step.

                                 ADYE
                        I already introduced myself. These 
                        two public servants are Constables 
                        Tamberly and Allen. 

                                 WEASELY THUG
                        Somebody shoot this prat!

                                 ADYE
                        And this here, this is Mr. Edward 
                        Hyde. Perhaps you’ve heard of him.

                                 JEKYLL
                        A pleasure to meet you all. Truly.

           He holds out his hand, as far as he can until his shackle 
           chain goes taut, but nobody takes it because--

                                 WRENCH-WIELDING AFRICAN
                        Hyde?

           The thugs have stopped, immediately recognizing that name.

                                 FAT-ASS THUG
                        Why’s he chained up like that?

           Adye holds up a tiny key, corner of his lips curled up. 
           Enjoying this just a little too much.

                                 ADYE
                        The important question, at least as 
                        far as you fine gentleman are 
                        concerned, is: how long will I 
                        leave him chained up like that?

           BLAM! BLAM-BLAM! Tamberly and Red-Face are shot by what 
           sounds like a powerful gun, and fly off their feet.

           Adye half-ducks, throwing up an arm reflexively. Jekyll, 
           fearless, establishes some center of gravity with his 
           shackled feet, shackled wrists coming up to meet attackers.

                                 ADYE
                        NOOOOOOO!

           CLOSE on a smoking hand cannon. A revolver, but, goddamn, 
           this thing could probably put a hole in a steel door.

           Holding it: CHRISTIAN BOB, a dandy of the underworld, stands 
           at the top of a staircase next to an open office door. 
           Just behind him, his brother: JOHN “LEATHER APRON” PIZER (a 
           jittery sociopath with bad facial hair).

                                 CHRISTIAN BOB
                        You cannot ‘ave me brother, 
                        Inspector. Your pet monster don’t 
                        scare me neither.

           Jekyll snarls like a wild animal.

                                 JEKYLL
                        I’m going to eat your face!

           Adye tries to draw his own revolver as the thugs pounce, but 
           a pipe cracks into his forearm. The revolver flies away.

           A boot connects with Adye’s jaw next, spinning his head 
           around dramatically. Blood sprays from his mouth.

           Jekyll’s head comes up in a reverse headbutt, connecting with 
           Weasely Thug’s chin. Teeth fly out of the thug’s mouth.

           He snatches Weasely Thug’s wrench and bats it into Fat-Ass 
           Thug’s kneecap, dropping him, then into the side of the 
           thug’s enormous skull.

           Jekyll grabs the dazed Adye then, pulling him toward a 
           staircase down to a sub-level.

                                 JEKYLL
                        No dilly dallying, Tom. This isn’t 
                        a Sunday stroll, is it?

                                 CHRISTIAN BOB
                        Stop ‘em!

           He fires a few times, but misses as Jekyll yanks Adye over 
           the staircase railing with him. They land hard on metal steps 
           and roll out of sight.

                                 SCARRED THUG
                        But that’s Hyde. I ain’t going near 
                        ‘im!

           Bob shoots Scarred Thug.

                                 CHRISTIAN BOB
                        Do I need to repeat myself?!

           INT. SUB-LEVEL - GUTTA PERCHA FACTORY - CONT'D

           A dark, wet brick tunnel. Jekyll has managed to guide the 
           dazed Adye some 30 feet from the staircase, the only source 
           of light except for what’s trickling through grates above. 
                                 ADYE
                        Whu...wha happened?

                                 JEKYLL
                        We got our arses kicked, Tom, and, 
                        to be honest with you, I can’t help 
                        but feel that smug attitude of 
                        yours is the reason why.

           Thugs begin descending the distant stairs.

                                 THUG
                        We’re not scared of you, Hyde!

           Jekyll helps Adye around a corner, Adye already in the 
           process of sliding to the wet ground. 

                                 ADYE
                        What are, what are we going to do?

                                 JEKYLL
                        I hate to be a doomsayer, but I 
                        think, given the situation here, 
                        dying quickly is probably the best 
                        we can hope for.

                                 ADYE
                        B-But you, you’re Hyde.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Not anymore, and certainly not 
                        without my serum. I’m a middle-aged 
                        scientist in chains, Tom. You’ve 
                        lost your only weapon and half your 
                        wits. Seriously, what do you think 
                        our chances are?

                                 THUG
                        Come out, come out, Hyde!

           Jekyll looks like he’s just come upon a brilliant idea.

                                 JEKYLL
                        You could, you know, give me some 
                        of the serum. Just enough to give 
                        me the strength I’d need to show 
                        these blokes a thing or two.

           Adye looks terrified at that thought, and clamps a hand over 
           his jacket where, underneath, the serum case is kept. 

                                 ADYE
                        Absolutely not. I won’t be the one 
                        to let Hyde back out of his cage.
                                 JEKYLL
                        Not Hyde, not Hyde. Just his 
                        strength. A drop is all I need, 
                        Tom. Think about it. We don’t have 
                        any other choice, do we?

           Adye is still terrified by the thought.

                                 JEKYLL
                        A dozen men are about to beat our 
                        skulls in, Tom! Then they’re going 
                        throw our bodies into the Thames 
                        without thinking twice!

                                 ADYE
                        And, and you promise you won’t kill 
                        any of them? You mustn’t kill 
                        anyone.

                                 JEKYLL
                             (sighs)
                        If you insist, Tom. 

           Adye thinks...what is he doing? This is crazy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The serum case being opened.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A serum vial’s cap being removed, revealing an eyedropper 
           connected to it. Glistening with glowing serum.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A drop of the serum drops and lands on Jekyll’s tongue.

           Jekyll throws his head back, immediately feeling the serum’s 
           power. Body rigid, fingers locked like long claws. 

           CLOSE on his neck, tendons becoming chorded. Veins bulging. 

           CLOSE on his bloodshot eyes, filling with YELLOW FLECKS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The thugs, approaching. They can hear GROWLING.

                                                               BACK TO:

           Adye, unlocking shackles. Both sets, along with the chain, 
           clatter to the ground next to him.
           We don’t see Jekyll’s face, only Adye’s reaction...his fear 
           at what he’s released.

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        Wait here.

           Jekyll sweeps around the corner, disappearing.

           Adye waits, breathing. Waits. Then--

           A LENGTHY SCREAM.

                                 THUG (O.S.)
                        Me armmmm! Someone get me arm back!

           Adye slowly climbs to his feet, eyes on a grate above that 
           leads to the factory floor. More SCREAMS from up there.

                                 THUG (O.S.)
                        Oh God, it burns!

                                 THUG (O.S.)
                        Shoot him! Shoot him!

           GUNSHOTS.

                                 THUG (O.S.)
                        You missed!

                                 THUG (O.S.)
                        He’s too fast!

           Movement around the grate, but we can’t identify it.

                                 THUG (O.S.)
                        Unh, I can’t feel my legs.

           Then, SILENCE.

           Suddenly, a thug, his mouth a mess of broken teeth, lands on 
           the grate. It CLANGS loudly, startling Adye.

                                 THUG
                        Ug...un...ahhelp...

           CLOSE on Adye’s face, still peering up. Drops of blood from 
           the thug’s mouth land on his cheek, running down it.

           INT. WORK FLOOR - GUTTA PERCHA FACTORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Adye slowly climbs the staircase, back to the work floor 
           where he gapes at the carnage Jekyll has wrought--

           --The Weasely Thug, on fire, runs by.
           --Three more thugs lie on the ground, two unconscious, one of 
           these the Bald Giant with a leg twisted at an incorrect 
           angle. The third, Fat-Ass Thug, writhes in terrible pain.

           --The Wrench-Wielding African hangs half off a walkway.

           Groans and moans here and there.

           Jekyll approaches, smiling as he steps over Tamberly’s body. 
           In the background, Christian Bob shuffles past, dazed, 
           hugging his severed arm to his chest.

                                 ADYE
                        You swore...you swore you wouldn’t 
                        kill anyone!

                                 JEKYLL
                        You forget I was a physician, Tom. 
                        They’ll live.

           Jekyll holds out his wrists. Adye stares at them, dumbstruck.

                                 JEKYLL
                        You didn’t leave my restraints 
                        below, did you? I wouldn’t want 
                        Chief Inspector Newcomen to know 
                        you’ve let me run around like some 
                        wild man. 
                             (smiles mischievously)
                        I hope I didn’t lead you to 
                        compromise yourself too dearly.

           INT. OFFICE - GUTTA PERCHA FACTORY - LATER

           Adye and Jekyll, who’s now shackled again, look down at 
           something before them. Somebody’s CRYING.

                                 JEKYLL
                        There is no chance in hell this is 
                        the man you’re after. Look at him.

           Pizer is crouched in the corner, crying like an infant. Adye 
           is skeptical of him, but--

                                 ADYE
                        That’s for the courts to decide.

           EXT. SCOTLAND YARD - NIGHT

           The police wagon that just delivered Pizer to Scotland Yard 
           pulls away. Adye, along with other CONSTABLES, lead a bleary 
           eyed Pizer up the steps as REPORTERS shout questions.
                                 VARIOUS REPORTERS
                        Are you guilty, Mr. Pizer? Is it 
                        true he’s called Leather Apron on 
                        account of his trade? Can London’s 
                        citizens sleep soundly again?

                                 REPORTER #5
                        What’s your name, Inspector?

                        Thomas Adye. 

                                 REPORTER #5
                        How do you spell that?

                                 ADYE
                        A. D. Y. E. 

           He takes a few more steps after Pizer, then turns to ask--

                                 ADYE
                        Will you be mentioning me in your 
                        article?

           The reporter smiles, familiar with fame-seekers.

                                 REPORTER #5
                        Of course, Inspector Adye. You just 
                        became the most famous law-
                        enforcement agent in London.

           EXT. ALLEY - SCOTLAND YARD - CONT'D

           Several CONSTABLES lead Jekyll from the police wagon, inside. 
           The sound of the REPORTERS’ QUESTIONS reaches even here.

                                 JEKYLL
                             (sotto, smirks)
                        You’re a hero now, Tom. Enjoy it 
                        while it lasts.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SCOTLAND YARD - LATER

           Newcomen, jacket off, shirt-sleeves rolled up, slugs Pizer so 
           hard that Pizer spills off the chair he’s seated in. Two 
           other INSPECTORS watch the “questioning” from behind him.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        We know it was you, it’s pointless 
                        to deny it.

           Blood and snot bubble out of Pizer’s nostrils. A document 
           smeared with more blood lands near his face.
                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Sign the goddamn confession! 

           Newcomen looks at the other inspectors.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Immigrants, I tell you. 
                             (shouts at Pizer)
                        Why can’t you stay in your own 
                        bloody countries?!

           INT. CITY HALL - DAY

           LONDON’S MAYOR, POLICE COMMISSIONER CHARLES WARREN, and 
           several CITY OFFICIALS congratulate Adye as PRESS 
           PHOTOGRAPHERS snap his picture. 

                                 LONDON’S MAYOR
                        Well done, Inspector Adye. 

           INT. OPULENT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Adye dines with SOCIETY’S UPPER-CRUST, including the mayor 
           and Commissioner Warren. A black-tie affair. Everybody seems 
           to love the young inspector, judging by the back-slapping.

                                 COMMISSIONER WARREN
                        I don’t think there’s a more 
                        promising young man in the whole 
                        Yard. You’ll go far, Tom, very far.

           Adye beams with pride. This is everything he’s always wanted.

           INT. ROYAL BOX - ROYAL ALBERT HALL - NIGHT

           An OPERA in progress can be heard as an MP quietly ushers 
           Adye into the royal box.

                                 MP
                        Wait here.

           The MP leans over a chair, whispering to ROYAL GUESTS -- 
           including PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR. Albert, a bored sort of 
           royal, waves Adye forward with opera-glasses.

                                 PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR
                        Ah, London’s knight in shining 
                        armor. Please, Inspector, come sit 
                        with me.

           He swats the ROYAL FRIEND sitting beside him.
                                 PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR
                        You, go somewhere else. I don’t 
                        remember your name. Who are you?

                                 ROYAL FRIEND
                        But, Prince Albert--

                                 PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR
                        No, I don’t care. 
                             (points at Adye)
                        You, here.

           Adye waits for the royal friend leave, then nervously sits.

                                 PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR
                        Do you like the opera?

                                 ADYE
                        My father was a great fa--

                                 PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR
                        It’s ghastly. I prefer dance halls, 
                        but nana thinks this more proper. 

           Adye decides not to reply and instead sit quietly. Something 
           inside him feels uneasy about this world he’s landed in.

           INT. HANSOM CAB - LATER THAT NIGHT

           From inside the shadows of the cab, Adye watches Mary Jane 
           and two other PROSTITUTES walk along the sidewalk, laughing.

           He knocks on the roof, and the cab hurries away.

           INT. OFFICE - HOSPITAL - DAY

           Outside, the hospital garden under a sunny sky; PATIENTS, 
           some being pushed in wheelchairs, wandering through them. 

           A TALL MAN stands at the window, looking out.

                                 TALL MAN
                        Henry Jekyll’s every thought was 
                        bent on serving his fellow men. My 
                        career seems...self-indulgent by 
                        comparison. 

           He’s speaking to Adye behind him. This is a doctor’s office.

                                 TALL MAN
                        What happened...Hyde, the deaths he 
                        caused...that was not Jekyll. You 
                        would understand that had you know 
                        him, the old him.
           Now we see the Tall Man’s face behind dark-rimmed glasses-- 

           DR. JOHN GABRIEL UTTERSON, five years older than we last saw 
           him. He has some silver at his temples, his brow seems 
           permanently creased by deep worries, and his cheeks are 
           sunken from the loss of several pounds. 

                                 UTTERSON
                        What is it you came here for, 
                        Inspector? You’ve caught your man. 
                        If you’re so afraid of the Jekyll 
                        you say is locked under Scotland 
                        Yard, leave him to suffer in peace.

                                 ADYE
                        It’s...not that easy for me. 

           Utterson looks over his shoulder at Adye. One eyebrow rising 
           slightly, something like sadness in his eyes. This man is 
           terribly haunted.

                                 UTTERSON
                        Ah, I see. Then it is all the more 
                        necessary that you turn from the 
                        abyss now, Inspector. 

           He approaches Adye. Unbuttoning and rolling up his sleeve.

                                 UTTERSON
                        After all, look at me. Five years 
                        I’ve lived with the constant fear 
                        that any moment, any moment indeed, 
                        Hyde will crawl through my window 
                        and exact his revenge for my part 
                        in his capture. I have no friends 
                        left. I am not much company anyway. 

           CLOSE on Utterson’s exposed arm: blown veins, needle marks.

                                 ADYE
                        Dear Lord.

                                 UTTERSON
                        I spend my evenings trying to 
                        forget what I have seen. What I 
                        have learned. 

           He gives Adye’s arm a reassuring squeeze.

                                 UTTERSON
                        Unfortunately, you can never unknow
                        horror once you have borne witness 
                        to it. Walk away now, Inspector. 
                        Forget Jekyll, forget all of this.
           INT. INSPECTOR POOL - SCOTLAND YARD - NIGHT

           Adye enters, dressed in a tux; on his way to an evening out. 
           Immediately, he gets ribbed by other INSPECTORS and 
           CONSTABLES, which he can only laugh at.

                                 INSPECTOR #1
                        Look oo’s ‘ere, Mr. Prim and 
                        Proper. 

                                 INSPECTOR #2
                        Look at how his hair shines, gents!

                                 CONSTABLE
                        Where’s it tonight, Inspector? 
                        Dining with a duke or Prince Albert 
                        ‘imself?

                                 ADYE
                        Both!

           Adye opens a drawer in his desk, looking for something. 
           Behind him, a YOUNG MAILBOY approaches with an envelope.

                                 YOUNG MAILBOY
                        Inspector, this came a few ‘ours 
                        ago. Somebody at the Central News 
                        Agency left it for you.

                                 ADYE
                        Thanks, Tim.

           Adye uses a letter opener on the envelope. Draws out a sheet 
           of stationary stamped with the Central News Agency’s logo.

           It reads: INSPECTOR ADYE, WE THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
           THIS BEFORE IT RUNS IN THIS EVENING’S PAPER.

           He tips the envelope over, letting a yellowish postcard slide 
           out into his hand. On the postcard, RED CURSIVE HANDWRITING, 
           the first words immediately evident to us--

           DEAR BOSS, I KEEP ON HEARING THE POLICE HAVE CAUGHT ME...

           Adye’s face tries to mask his immediate panic from the others 
           around him as he continues to read.

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        “Dear Boss, I keep on hearing the 
                        police have caught me but they wont 
                        fix me just yet. I have laughed 
                        when they look so clever and talk 
                        about being on the right track.
           EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

           PEOPLE read the headlines: WHITECHAPEL MURDERER STILL ON THE 
           LOOSE. Shocked and frightened.

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        “That joke about Leather Apron gave 
                        me real fits. I am down on whores 
                        and I shant quit ripping them till 
                        I do get buckled.

           INT. NEWCOMEN’S OFFICE - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           Newcomen, red faced with fury, crumbles up his newspaper. 
           Swats a cup of tea away with it.

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        “Grand work the last job was. I 
                        gave the lady no time to squeal. I 
                        love my work and want to start 
                        again.

           INT. DINING ROOM - COMMISSIONER WARREN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Commissioner Warren rises from the table where he was 
           breakfasting, and strides out past his entering BUTLER. Lying 
           across his abandoned meal is the newspaper article, which has 
           reprinting an illustration of the letter Adye is reading.

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        “The next job I do I shall clip the 
                        ladys ears off and send to the 
                        police officers just for jolly 
                        wouldn't you.

           INT. CITY HALL - DAY

           London’s mayor makes his way through a crowd of SHOUTING 
           REPORTERS, helped by SECURITY GUARDS.

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        “My knife's so nice and sharp I 
                        want to get to work right away if I 
                        get a chance. Good Luck.”

           INT. DUNGEON - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           From his cell, Jekyll watches CONSTABLES unlock the door to 
           the cell next to him. 

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        “Yours truly, Jack the Ripper. 
                        Please don’t mind me giving the 
                        trade name.”
           The constables pull John Pizer from the cell, and lead the 
           sniveling man away. To freedom.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Sorry about that, mate. I was 
                        always on your side.

           EXT. STREET - WHITECHAPEL - NIGHT

           A CONSTABLE walks the street, ringing a bell as he shouts--

                                 CONSTABLE SHOUTER
                        Keep inside if you can! Keep your 
                        doors and windows locked! Jack the 
                        Ripper’s still on the loose!

           INT. THE TEN BELLS - NIGHT

           Mary Jane scoops up three tankards of beer from the bar as 
           she flashes the BARKEEP a big smile.

                                 MARY JANE KELLY
                        Ta, Frank.

           She starts toward the back of the busy, loud pub when 
           something causes her to turn-- 

           Adye is standing there, watching her. Clearly distraught.

                                 ADYE
                        Ma’am.

           She smiles sweetly at him, a connection here now.

           SOMEONE ELSE’S POV: From within the crowd, Adye and Mary Jane 
           are themselves being watched.

           INT. MARY JANE’S FLAT - LATER

           The fireplace crackles in this ramshackle, but homey flat as 
           Adye and Mary Jane rush to peel each others clothes off.

           They fall onto the small bed, him on top. Her stocking legs 
           wrapped around him, her hands working at his pants.

                                 MARY ANNE
                        Tom? Tom?

           Something’s wrong. His eyes are filled with tears. 

                                 MARY ANNE
                        It’s alright, it is. ‘Appens all 
                        the time in me work. 
           But it’s not his flaccidity that has devastated him. He rolls 
           off her, sliding to the floor. She waits quietly, unsure what 
           to do next.

                                 MARY JANE
                        I don’t understand why you came, 
                        Tom. You don’t belong ‘ere, ‘ere in 
                        Whitechapel. 

           He laughs, disgusted with himself.

                                 ADYE
                        I belong here more than you do. At 
                        least I was born here.

           That surprises her. She slides to the floor beside him.

                                 ADYE
                        I’ve spent my whole life trying to 
                        forget that fact, trying to 
                        transform myself into someone else. 
                        For a moment there, I thought I’d 
                        succeeded. I’d proven I was every 
                        bit as good as any of them. But 
                        now...now I’m nobody again.  

           She lifts a strand of hair from his forehead.

                                 MARY JANE
                        T’was an ‘onest mistake, Tom. 
                        Leather Apron, e’s as barmy as they 
                        come, ‘e is. Might not be the 
                        killer you’re looking for, this 
                        Ripper, but I’m sure e’s killed 
                        women before, you can bet a bob on 
                        it.

                                 ADYE
                        But that’s just it. I knew it 
                        wasn’t him. I knew until men began 
                        patting me on the back, calling me 
                        London’s champion. Three women dead 
                        now, butchered, and the only man 
                        with enough integrity to speak the 
                        truth on the matter is a madman in 
                        his own right.

           She looks at him, unsure what to say. He leans in and kisses 
           her, takes her face as if to make another go at making love.

           But she stops him. He’s confused.
                                 MARY JANE KELLY
                        You’re a good bloke, Tom. Remember 
                        that.

           He smiles weakly at the sentiment.

           INT. INSPECTOR POOL - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           Adye studies a new Ripper letter, one of many on his desk. 
           It’s again written in red ink on the back of a postcard. 

           Words like: YOU’LL HEAR ABOUT SAUCY JACKY’S WORK TOMORROW.

           And: JACK THE RIPPER.

                                 ADYE
                             (sotto)
                        You’re announcing yourself. Trying 
                        to make me feel helpless, weak, 
                        aren’t you?

           He flips the postcard over, revealing more red ink that 
           addresses the postcard to the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY. But he 
           sees something else, too, something he can’t quite make out.

           So Adye pulls a large magnifying glass attached to an arm 
           over, so it hovers over the postcard.

           CLOSE on the magnified postcard. Beneath the red address, 
           there appears to be gold embossed font.

           YOU AND A GUEST ARE INVITED TO A PRIVATE EVENT.

           There’s more, but we don’t get that far yet.

                                 ADYE
                             (sotto)
                        Or are you daring me to try and 
                        stop you...tonight?

           INT. DUNGEON - SCOTLAND YARD - LATER

           Adye watches as TWO CONSTABLES prepare to unlock Jekyll’s 
           cell door. The window-cover is down.

                                 ADYE
                        If you don’t mind, I’m in a bit of 
                        a hurry.

                                 CONSTABLE #6
                        Are you sure the Chief Inspector 
                        understood you’d be removing the 
                        prisoner again, sir? 
                                 CONSTABLE #7
                        He was very specific that you not 
                        even be allowed down here.

                                 ADYE
                        That’s his signature, isn’t it?

           A constable holds some sort of form with a signature that he 
           looks skeptical of, but not enough to actually question it.

                                 CONSTABLE #7
                        Yes, sir.

                                 ADYE
                        And time is of the essence. The 
                        Chief Inspector has gone home for 
                        the evening, so we can either send 
                        an officer to confirm his order -- 
                        in which case you two will no doubt 
                        be scrubbing toilets when he 
                        discovers the Ripper slipped 
                        through my fingers because of your 
                        incompetence -- or you can follow 
                        the order you’re holding in your 
                        hand and open the bloody door.

           The constables consider that...and unlock the door.

                                 CONSTABLE #6
                        Our apologies, sir.

           The constables jump back, reaching for their weapons. 

           Jekyll is standing on the other side of the door, as if he’s 
           been patiently waiting for them. Holding a newspaper with a 
           headline about JACK THE RIPPER.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Good evening, gentlemen. 
                             (to Adye)
                        Our boy has taken a new name for 
                        his counterpart, just as I once 
                        did. I presume he’s struck again.

                                 ADYE
                        Not quite.

           Not quite? That intrigues Jekyll.

                                 JEKYLL (PRE-LAP)
                        “You and a guest are invited to a 
                        private event at Griffyn House on 
                        the 30th of September.”
           INT. HANSOM CAB - NIGHT

           Adye is in the process of redressing himself in a tux, 
           pulling the jacket from a suit bag. Jekyll, in shackles and 
           his prison denim, is reading the postcard in the dark.

                                 JEKYLL
                        But that’s tonight.

                                 ADYE
                        Now you understand the opportunity. 

           He slips on his jacket as Jekyll continues to read--

                                 JEKYLL
                        “Please refrain from sharing news 
                        of this gathering with uninvited 
                        acquaintances.” 
                             (grins)
                        Woops. So what will be my role in 
                        this party-crashing scheme?

           EXT. GRIFFYN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Adye and Jekyll -- BOTH dressed in tuxes, top hats, and silk 
           scarves -- exit the cab they just arrived in. They look like 
           high society’s most dashing bachelors.

           Jekyll rubs his unshackled wrists.

                                 JEKYLL
                        I thank you for this, Tom. It’s 
                        been too long since I felt good 
                        about my attire.

           Adye and Jekyll, along with other GUESTS, approach the stairs 
           and imposing facade of Griffyn House.

                                 ADYE
                        It’s not for your satisfaction, 
                        Doctor. The Ripper wants us here, 
                        and I need you to help me deduce 
                        the why.

           The DOORMAN inspects the red-ink-covered invite.

                                 DOORMAN
                        Wha’s this? 

                                 ADYE
                        I do apologize. My, ah, wife 
                        mistook it for a postcard. 
                             (points)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADYE (CONT'D)
                        You can still read the invite, 
                        though, see.

           The doorman regards him like he’s an idiot.

           INT. LOUNGE - GRIFFYN HOUSE

           Jekyll stands at a tablecloth-covered table, watching the 
           PARTY GUESTS around him: lingerie-dressed SERVANT GIRLS in 
           top hats offer drinks and hors d’oeuvres to GENTLEMEN who 
           grope them. Plenty of GENTLEWOMEN enjoying the evening, too.

           Adye returns with two glasses of champagne.

                                 ADYE
                        I just saw a woman doing the most 
                        extraordinary, disturbing thing 
                        with a garden vegetable as Lord 
                        Pemberton and his son observed.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Yes, it’s a very Roman atmosphere 
                        tonight, isn’t it? 
                             (downs his champagne)
                        I’m having a smashing time.

                                 ADYE
                        This is not what I expected. I’m 
                        very uncomfortable.

           Jekyll pointedly ignores Adye’s uptightness.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Oh, look, there’s your Commissioner 
                        Warren. And that is most definitely 
                        not his wife on his lap.

           On the opposite side of the room, Commissioner Warren is 
           seated on a lounge, laughing wildly as he fondles a servant 
           girl who’s doing her best to escape him.

                                 ADYE
                        And how would you know what his 
                        wife looks like?

           Jekyll snatches another glass of a champagne from a passing 
           servant girl.
                                 JEKYLL
                        Because five years ago, I, or 
                        rather Hyde, fornicated with Mrs. 
                        Warren and her sister, an advocate 
                        for abused women, whilst the 
                        commissioner and his brother-in-law 
                        played cards in their parlor.

           Adye spits champagne. Jekyll doesn’t seem to notice.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Glorious breasts those two had.

           LORD BURTON (70; doddering old man) stops at the table. 

                                 LORD BURTON
                        Pardon me, gentlemen. I'm looking 
                        for my wife, the Lady Burton?

                                 JEKYLL
                        She's polishing the ole knob at the 
                        moment, mate. Come back in a few 
                        minutes.

                                 LORD BURTON
                        Well I never!

           He storms off. Adye eyes Jekyll.

                                 ADYE
                        Have you ever wondered how God will 
                        regard you when you finally come 
                        before him? There is still time to 
                        repent, you know.

           Jekyll waves his champagne at the room around him as if to 
           say, “Look at these people.”

                                 JEKYLL
                        Like these good men? Men you so 
                        desperately want to accept you as 
                        one of their own?

                                 ADYE
                        These are London's finest, by birth 
                        and training. Beacons by which all 
                        others can, if they so desire, be 
                        led.

           Jekyll points to a GENTLEMAN leading a SECOND GENTLEMAN out 
           of the room BY THE HAND.
                                 JEKYLL
                        I see some leading being done, but 
                        I doubt you would approve.

                                 ADYE
                        Dear Lord.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Oh, I doubt He would approve 
                        either.

           EXT. ALLEY - WHITECHAPEL - SAME

           A modest TRAVELING SALESMAN sits atop his cart’s bench, using 
           a thin, stiff whip to prod his pony to turn into an alley. 

                                 TRAVELING SALESMAN
                        Almost home, Greta.

           The pony makes it only a few feet into the alley when it 
           rears up, whinnying. 

                                 TRAVELING SALESMAN
                        What is it now?

           AT THE FAR END OF THE ALLEY: Prostitute ELIZABETH STRIDE (45) 
           lies on the wet ground, looking toward the backlit pony and 
           cart as the salesman alights. She’d scream, but JACK THE 
           RIPPER’s black-gloved hand is over her mouth.

                                 TRAVELING SALESMAN
                        Never heard of no pony scared of 
                        the dark.

           CLOSE on Stride’s struggling, gagged face. Eyes pleading.

                                 ELIZABETH STRIDE
                        Mm...rmm...mnn...

           The Ripper’s voice has a demonic, but dignified quality as he 
           whispers--

                                 THE RIPPER
                        Quiet, my lovely.

           The salesman tries to forcibly lead the pony into the alley, 
           but the pony isn’t having it. 

                                 ELIZABETH STRIDE
                        Rrnn...mrr...

           The salesman looks over his shoulder with concern, having 
           heard something now. 
           He starts down the alley without his pony, lamp held out with 
           one hand, the other drawn back with the whip in it like a 
           weapon.

                                 TRAVELING SALESMAN
                        Is...somebody there?

           The circular sphere of his lamp’s light slowly climbs across 
           cobblestones and walls...over Stride’s outstretched arm...and 
           then catches on a MODEST FOUNTAIN OF DARK BLOOD rising from 
           her neck that we CUT AWAY from almost instantly.

                                 TRAVELING SALESMAN
                        Are you all righ...oh my, oh my 
                        God. Oh my God!

           FROM THE ROOFTOP ABOVE: The Ripper peers down at the 
           salesman, who’s now running away from the visible body.

                                 TRAVELING SALESMAN
                        He’s done it again! The Ripper’s 
                        done it again!!

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. LOUNGE - GRIFFYN HOUSE

           Adye and Jekyll, at the table still.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Do you never tire of being proper 
                        every moment of every day, Tom? 
                        This incessant need to adhere to a 
                        norm dictated by liars and 
                        hypocrites? 

           Commissioner Warren is kissed by a chesty LATIN WOMAN, 
           probably a prostitute, as her hand sinks into his pants.

                                 JEKYLL
                        What do you think is going on here? 
                        Do you think they're addled by the 
                        constraints they've imposed on the 
                        peasant-minded class you were born 
                        into?

           TWO WOMEN on a lounge make out as TWO MEN grope them. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        No, they know no bounds. No limits 
                        to their desires. They are the true 
                        dregs of society, parasites all-oh-
                        oh, uh, yes.
           Jekyll leans his head back slightly, eyes closed.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Yes, indeed, that's very nice. 
                        Saucy wench, you are.

                                 ADYE
                             (confused)
                        Did you just call me...saucy?

           A GENTLEWOMAN climbs out from under the table and tablecloth 
           then, running the back of her hand across her mouth. Jekyll 
           smiles appreciatively.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Your husband was looking for you.

                                 GENTLEWOMAN (LADY BURTON)
                        Oh damn.

           Jekyll pats her on the ass.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Now run along, my lamb.

           He pays no mind to the way Adye continues to gape at him. 

                                 ADYE
                        No words. There are no words.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Then don’t waste any.

           A smiling SERVANT GIRL appears, presenting them with a silver 
           tray covered in tiny gold-rimmed shot glasses, each of which 
           contain what looks like a single blue, DIAMOND-SHAPED PILL.

                                 SERVANT GIRL
                        Care to indulge?

                                 JEKYLL
                             (indicates Adye)
                        Always, but never mind him. 
                             (whispers to her)
                        Real prude, this one.

           He reaches for one of the shot glasses, but Adye slaps his 
           wrist like he’s a child.

                                 ADYE
                        What are they?

                                 SERVANT GIRL
                        Liberation.
                                 JEKYLL
                        Then you most definitely have to 
                        try one, Tom.

           He takes two shot glasses, handing one off to Tom. The 
           servant girl wanders away, smiling at Jekyll’s wink.

           Adye studies the pill without removing it from the glass.

                                 JEKYLL
                        You won’t learn anything like that.

           He removes his pill, gives it an exploratory lick. One of his 
           eyebrows immediately rise, as if in surprise.

                                 ADYE
                        What is it?

                                 JEKYLL
                        My serum, I’ll be damned.

                                 ADYE
                        Your serum?

                                 JEKYLL
                        Aspects of it, at least. The 
                        adrenaline tastes like...fear.

           He smiles, about to eat the pill, but Adye swipes it away. 
           Jekyll groans like he’s been robbed of a tasty morsel.

                                 ADYE
                        Is this what Jack brought us here 
                        for? To show us this?

                                 JEKYLL
                        Oh no, this was all a ruse.

           Adye drops the pills into a tiny manila evidence envelope.

                                 ADYE
                        A ruse?

                                 JEKYLL
                        Must you repeat everything I say in 
                        the form of a question, Tom? Yes, a 
                        ruse. Intended to distract us, to 
                        make us feel like fools, whilst 
                        Jack whiled away his evening on the 
                        hunt. In Whitechapel, no doubt.

                                 ADYE
                        You knew this? When? When did you 
                        figure it out?!
                                 JEKYLL
                             (nonchalant)
                        Oh, when you told me about the 
                        invitation. I did the same thing 
                        myself, to Utterson and your Chief 
                        Inspector. Don’t worry, they fell 
                        for it, too.

                                 ADYE
                        But, but...what are we doing here?!

           A mischievous smile tugs at Jekyll’s lips.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Look at me, Tom. I'm wearing a 
                        tuxedo, I've got a glass of 
                        champagne in my hand, and some old 
                        geezer's wife just became the first 
                        person other than doctors to touch 
                        my prick in five years. Why do you
                        think we're here?

           EXT. ALLEY - WHITECHAPEL - LATER

           Numerous SCOTLAND YARD TYPES hold back REPORTERS from the 
           Stride murder scene.

                                 REPORTERS
                        Was it the Ripper, Constable? Is 
                        she another whore? Who was that man 
                        with Inspector Adye?

           AT THE FAR END OF THE ALLEY: Jekyll crouches over Stride’s 
           body, hand held to his chin. One finger dragging across his 
           lips, as if he might be turned on by what he sees.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Oh my. How delicious.

           Adye stands over Jekyll, who’s pointing now at Stride’s neck.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Look at this, Tom, at how confident 
                        the incision is. How steady his 
                        hand must have been. This isn’t the 
                        clumsy work of some butcher, oh no.

           Adye doesn’t respond, churlishly silent.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Really, Tom? Do you intend to 
                        behave like this for the remainder 
                        of the evening? It’s really not fun 
                        at all.
           Adye, still silent.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Would it help if I apologized? 
                        Would that help? 

           Adye, still silent.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Very well, I am sorry. 

           Adye, still silent.

                                 JEKYLL
                        I’m sorry, Tom.

           Adye sighs. Steps closer.

                                 ADYE
                        Then I wasn’t wrong in my 
                        conclusions.

           Jekyll smiles surreptitiously at Adye’s surrender as he turns 
           his attention back to the corpse.

                                 JEKYLL
                        I should think not. This here is a 
                        stroke of luck.

           Jekyll stands now, to face Adye.

                                 JEKYLL
                        The Ripper was interrupted. His 
                        work here unfinished, his appetite 
                        unsated.

                                 ADYE
                        What are you saying? 

                                 JEKYLL
                        He’ll strike again tonight, and 
                        more ferociously than before. He 
                        won’t be able to stop himself. 

                                 ADYE
                        And how is that a stroke of luck?

                                 JEKYLL
                        We’ll have a second chance to catch 
                        him in the act, of course.

           Adye considers that for a beat, then resolutely--
                                 ADYE
                        What are we to do?

           Jekyll looks at Adye. Read my mind, his face says.

           Adye shakes his head: oh no, oh no, don’t even try it.

                                 ADYE
                        No, not again.

           The corner of Jekyll’s lips slowly curl up.

                                 JEKYLL
                        You’ve seen what he’s capable of, 
                        Tom. How dangerous he is. It took 
                        all of Scotland Yard to stop 
                        me...which makes me your best hope 
                        of stopping the Ripper.

           Adye sighs, reaching into his jacket for the serum case.

                                 ADYE
                        I know, I know...what choice do I 
                        have?

           The case opens, revealing there four glowing vials of serum.

           AT THE OPENING OF THE ALLEY: The crowd reacts to GROANS and a 
           GUTTURAL YOWL, sounds from Jekyll’s partial transformation.

           AT THE FAR END OF THE ALLEY: Adye watches Jekyll clamber up 
           the alley wall as if it wasn’t even a real obstacle. Jekyll’s 
           jacket comes off as he does so, flapping through the air.

                                 ADYE
                        Is there any point in asking you 
                        not to kill him? Please!

           EXT. ROOFS OF WHITEHCHAPEL - LATER

           Jekyll leaps between roofs, a predator hunting a predator. 
           Pauses to examine what might be blood: sniffs.

           OVERHEAD: An unsteady SHOT that turns out to be Adye’s POV
           from the basket of a--

           INT. HOT-AIR BALLOON - CONT'D

           --flying low over the district. Adye clearly doesn’t like 
           heights, which the BALLOON OPERATOR behind him finds amusing.

                                 ADYE
                        And you say men and women use this 
                        balloon to view the city...for fun?
           London spreads every direction around them.

                                 BALLOON OPERATOR
                        Yes, sir.

           The basket passes through a cloud of BLACK SMOKE rising from 
           a chimney. Adye coughs.

                                 ADYE
                        Whatever for. 

           The basket jerks, a result of the thick rope tied to its 
           front. The rope leads below to the--

           EXT. STREET - WHITECHAPEL - CONT'D

           --where its anchored to the bench of a large POLICE WAGON. 
           There, two constables -- BEARD and RED-HEAD -- are urging a 
           team of FOUR BLACK HORSES forward. Towing the balloon.

           All around them, other CONSTABLES, some led by DOGS following 
           scents, spread out into alleys and down streets. Searching.

                                 CONSTABLE RED-HEAD
                        ‘Ow you ‘olding up, Inspector?! 

           INT. HOT-AIR BALLOON - CONT'D

           Adye gags, trying not to vomit. Pulls his rifle closer.

           EXT. ALLEY - WHITECHAPEL - CONT'D

           Jekyll leaps over the alley above, the balloon passing by 
           above him.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - CHURCH - CONT'D

           Jekyll lands atop the base of a hexagonal steeple, his badass
           hero-shot. Teeth bared; bow tie undone and flapping in the 
           wind; tuxedo shirt open to reveal his hirsute chest.

           He points for Adye and the balloon operator.

                                 JEKYLL
                        That way! Take High Street toward 
                        Mitre Square!

                                 ADYE
                        Are you certain?!

                                 JEKYLL
                        Whoever killed the whore came this 
                        way. I can smell her blood on him!
           EXT. MITRE SQUARE - SAME

           Located just outside Whitechapel, we’re in a more reputable 
           district now. Prostitute CATHERINE EDDOWES (46) walks through 
           fog on her way home.

           The Ripper steps out from a recessed doorway and tips his hat 
           toward Eddowes, who’s smiling. We only see him from behind, 
           but his hair is neatly parted with pomade and his exaggerated 
           collar is clearly open so Eddowes can see his face.

                                 CATHERINE EDDOWES
                        Well, ‘ello there, guvner. You look 
                        strapped for good company.

           The Ripper tilts his head slightly.

                                 THE RIPPER 
                        You’ll do.

           Eddowes falls back as his arm comes up, a medical blade in it 
           held in a slashing fashion.

           She screams as blood splatters across a white stone wall. 
           More blood splatters across a window.

           Eddowes tries to rise from the ground, something wrong with 
           her face besides just the blood. Shadows obscure.

                                 CATHERINE EDDOWES
                        Unh...rrk...

           The Ripper’s coat opens, his frightening collection of 
           medical tools turned killing devices revealed.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        This will likely hurt. A lot.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. HOT-AIR BALLOON

           Adye studies the foggy streets below, looking for anything. 

           Then: A PROSTITUTE, tiny from up here, runs around a tall 
           building’s corner, arms flailing.

                                 PROSTITUTE
                        Police! Police! ‘E’s killing ‘er!

           The basket’s movement slowly brings it past a tall building’s 
           corner, to reveal a perpendicular street.
                                 ADYE
                        There!

           He points at the fog-shrouded Ripper, hunched over something 
           on the sidewalk.

                                 ADYE
                        There he is!

           EXT. MITRE SQUARE - INTERCUT

           The Ripper -- face masked now as he’s hunched over Eddowes, 
           “working” -- throws up an arm to deflect stone bits flung at 
           him when a BULLET strikes the wall next to him.

           He looks up, spotting Adye firing his rifle again.

           CONSTABLE BEARD snaps the reins to drive the team of horses 
           forward, as Red-Hair fires at the Ripper with a revolver.

           ADYE shouts--

                                 ADYE
                        No, don’t!

           The police wagon’s tow rope yanks taut as the team of horses 
           gallop forward, the force of this causing the balloon basket 
           to tilt violently -- tossing Adye over the side.

           He catches the side of the basket, saving himself from 
           certain death.

           CONSTABLE RED-HAIR finishes cutting through the tow rope with 
           a pocket knife.

                                 CONSTABLE RED-HAIR
                        There, we’re free!

           THE RIPPER steps calmly into the foggy street, sliding his 
           medical knife under his coat. 

           The team of horses, snorting steam from their nostrils, 
           gallop at him.

                                 CONSTABLE RED-HAIR
                        Run the bastard down!

           THE BALLOON OPERATOR tries to help Adye back into the basket.

           BELOW, the distance between the horses and the Ripper has 
           been halved.

           The Ripper cracks his neck to the right, then to the left. 
           The horses are almost upon him when--

           He calmly sidesteps, GRABS THE COLLAR of the horse passing 
           closest to him, and YANKS down so hard that--

           The horse CRASHES TO THE STREET amidst swirling fog.

           Its partner in line follows suit, whinnying in terror. 

           Behind it, the other two horses buck up and collide with the 
           fallen horses. As the police wagon overturns, Constable Beard 
           are Red-Hair are thrown.

           THE BALLOON OPERATOR freezes in his assistance of Adye, 
           unable to believe what he’s just seen. 

                                 BALLOON OPERATOR
                        Merciful God.

           Adye gets one leg over the basket’s edge, stabilizing himself 
           enough that he can look and see what’s happened, too. A 
           tangled pile of horses, wood, and wheels.

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        Tom, hold on!

           With the operator’s help, Adye tries to quickly pull himself 
           further onboard as--

           JEKYLL leaps off a nearby building top, toward the balloon. 
           He seems to hover mid-air for a moment, legs wheeling.

           But he’s already descending, we realize; no chance he’ll make 
           the basket that Adye has just dropped back into. Instead--

           He catches the thick tow rope now hanging from the basket.

           The basket jerks violently again, slamming Adye into the side 
           of it as--

           Jekyll slides down the rope, body swinging around from the 
           initial momentum of his jump.

           THE RIPPER looks up as--

           Jekyll lands atop the overturned police wagon, wood 
           shattering around his shoes. Splinters fly up around his 
           grinning face, past his murderous yellow-flecked eyes.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        I’ve been waiting for this.

           Jekyll leaps at the Ripper, but the Ripper catches and throws 
           him into a brick wall that crumbles inward at the impact.
                                 THE RIPPER
                        Do you really think you have a 
                        chance against me? ME?!

           Jekyll snarls, lunging and swinging at startling speed with 
           open hands, as if he might claw the Ripper’s face open. 

           The Ripper evades these blows while lashing out with MEDICAL 
           BLADES from his harness -- some of which Jekyll knocks away 
           in the flurry of limbs. Several, however, stab deep into 
           Jekyll’s back and side.

           Jekyll, slowing, swings wide with his arm, only to be snared 
           and flipped through the air. He lands on his back, a couple 
           blades sticking out of him as if he’s a stuck pig.

           The Ripper tears one of the police wagon’s wheels off and 
           swings it as Jekyll, now on his feet, lunges.

           ADYE watches Jekyll fly some 20 feet through the air, swatted 
           like a ballistic tennis ball.

           JEKYLL slams into a gas lamp post so hard that the metal post 
           bends. The lamp itself flares, fire-balling briefly.

           ADYE watches the Ripper approach Jekyll, who’s barely moving.

                                 ADYE
                             (sotto)
                        Why didn’t I give him more of the 
                        serum?

           THE RIPPER slowly saunters up to Jekyll.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        Your serum is already antiquated, 
                        Jekyll. A thing of the past. 

           Jekyll rolls over, clearly dazed. The Ripper stands over him.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        I am the future. What you created, 
                        I perfected.

           The Ripper presses his shoe into Jekyll’s throat, choking 
           him. Pressing ever harder as he clenches his own fist, 
           emphasizing the power he “holds” in it.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        Now die already, will you?!

           BANG! The Ripper’s right shoulder blade splatters with blood, 
           spinning him around as he growls in pain.
           Jekyll gasps immediately, sucking in air.

           ADYE, fires with his rifle at the Ripper again -- the bullet 
           dinging off the lamp post.

                                 ADYE
                        That’s right, you sonuvabitch. You 
                        can bleed as well.

           AT THE MOUTH OF MITRE SQUARE, the rest of Scotland Yard has 
           caught up with the balloon and police wagon. CONSTABLES with 
           DOGS in front of them; revolvers and rifles aimed, a few 
           already firing at the Ripper.

                                 CONSTABLE
                        There ‘e is!

                                 THE RIPPER
                        Until we meet again, Hyde.

           He kicks Jekyll in the face, then looks up at the balloon.

           ADYE watches the Ripper calmly doff his cap at him, and takes 
           another shot with his rifle in response.

           THE RIPPER vanishes into a dark alley as bullets ricochet off 
           of walls around him.

           ADYE shouts--

                                 ADYE
                        Jekyll! Jekyll, are you alive?!

           THE CONSTABLES run after the Ripper, but one stops to look up 
           at the balloon. Face seriously concerned.

                                 CONSTABLE 
                        Did he say Jekyll?

           He looks at Jekyll, who’s using the bent lamp post to crawl 
           to his feet. Jekyll?!

           The constable marches up to Jekyll, drawing his nightstick--

                                 ADYE
                        No!

           --and, as Jekyll turns, cracks him across the face with it.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. NEWCOMEN’S OFFICE - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           The framed newspaper article on the wall shatters, struck by 
           an ashtray that Newcomen pitched at it. The Chief Inspector 
           furiously waves a fist-crushed newspaper at Adye.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        They’re calling it the Double 
                        Event! They’re naming his murders 
                        now thanks to your incompetence!

                                 ADYE
                        We almost had the Ripper, sir. We 
                        almost had him.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        But you didn’t get ‘im, now did 
                        you? Worse, all of London seems 
                        to’ve ‘eard Hyde’s back in 
                        business. The public’s lost all 
                        faith in Scotland Yard.

                                 ADYE
                        I wasn’t aware they had any in us 
                        to begin with, sir.

           Newcomen boils at that retort. Stomps around his desk as if 
           to slug Adye, but stops before he lifts his clenched fist. 
           Adye never budges, but his shoulders sag with relief when the 
           blow doesn’t come.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Don’t you. Don’t you dare mock me.

                                 ADYE
                        Sir, I know how people feel about 
                        Jekyll...but he almost died trying 
                        to help us. That must count for 
                        something.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        ‘E’s not ‘elping us. ‘E’s playing 
                        you, like a goddamn chess piece. 
                        You’re as inconsequential as a pawn 
                        to him, and ‘e’ll sacrifice you the 
                        first chance ‘e gets if it helps 
                        ‘im with whatever sick game ‘e’s 
                        playing.
                             (curses inaudibly)
                        Christ, man, are you that thick? 
                        You let ‘im ‘ave at ‘is serum! What 
                        were you thinking?!
                                 ADYE
                             (determined)
                        I know I can catch the Ripper, sir. 

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        You had your chance. Commissioner 
                        Warren is pinning this cock-up on 
                        you, and I completely agree with 
                        ‘im. You just better ‘ope the press 
                        doesn’t demand more blood, coz you 
                        might not even ‘ave a job when all 
                        is said and done. 

           Adye absorbs this demoralizing news.

           EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET - WHITECHAPEL - DAY

           The Ten Bells is getting plenty of business this morning, 
           while, nearby, Christ Church looks all but ignored.

           PRE-LAP: A children’s choir, accompanied by Christ Church’s 
           famous organ, sing “AVE MARIA.”

           INT. CHRIST CHURCH - CONT'D

           Adye sits alone in an expanse of empty pews, listening to the 
           CHILDREN’S CHOIR, led by a heart-wrenching FALSETTO, sing 
           “Ave Maria.” He’s teetering at the edge of an emotional 
           precipice, ever closer to the abyss Utterson described.

           Someone sits down beside him. She takes his hand, squeezes.

           Adye and Mary Jane sit like this for several moments. Then--

                                 MARY JANE KELLY
                        I’d hoped I wouldn’t see you back 
                        ‘ere, Tom.

                                 ADYE
                        I’m losing myself. 

                                 MARY JANE KELLY
                        Do you even know who you truly are? 
                        Seems to me, you’re at war with 
                        something inside yourself. 

           The choir finishes “Ave Maria,” and the sudden silence of the 
           church proves unsettling.

                                 MARY JANE KELLY
                        We can go someplace, if that’s what 
                        you be needing.

           He looks at her, smiles weakly. Maybe sadly.
                                 MARY JANE KELLY
                        Meself, I’d rather you find me 
                        mates’ killer. 
                             (with a playful wink)
                        Between us, I don’t think these 
                        other peelers ‘ave ‘alf your wits.

           She stands. Kisses his forehead softly. And leaves.

           Adye watches the choir disperse, contemplating what Mary 
           Kelly said.

           INT. LABORATORY - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           One of the “LIBERATION” pills PLINKS into a small beaker 
           filled with a clear liquid. Begins dissolving immediately.

           An eyedropper extracts some of the resultant green fluid.

           A drop of this then lands on a slide, and hands fit the slide 
           into a microscope.

           Adye leans into the eyepiece, and studies the sample’s 
           bizarre characteristics. 

           He rolls to a second microscope on the table, beside which 
           sits the open serum case. The sample under this microscope’s 
           lens is virtually indistinguishable from the previous one.

           That worries Adye.

                                 ADYE (PRE-LAP)
                        I’m looking for records regarding 
                        unsolved murders.

                                 CLERK (PRE-LAP)
                        We keep those on the stale bread 
                        shelf. How far back?

                                 ADYE (PRE-LAP)
                        Let’s start at two years.

           INT. RECORDS ROOM - SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

           A CLERK drops a towering stack of files onto a table where 
           Adye sits. 

                                 CLERK
                        This is everything we’ve got, 
                        Inspector.

           Adye is both surprised and disturbed by the stack.
                                 ADYE
                        So many.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Adye, reading through these files. Crime scene photos of 
           various murders, many of which seem to be of women of 
           questionable means. Likely prostitutes.

           Many of these files include CHIEF INSPECTOR NEWCOMEN’s 
           signature somewhere in the paperwork.

           The clerk passes through, pulling on his jacket.

                                 CLERK
                        I’m heading home for the evening, 
                        Inspector. Find what you’re looking 
                        for?

                                 ADYE
                             (grimly)
                        Unfortunately, yes.

           EXT. GARDEN - HOSPITAL - DUSK

           Adye and Utterson sit on a bench. Utterson delicately eating 
           a cucumber sandwich over wax paper on his lap.

                                 ADYE
                        I need to know, Doctor. Can I trust 
                        Jekyll?

           Utterson chews, surprised by the question. 

                                 UTTERSON
                        Difficult to say. I must imagine a 
                        part of the good man that was my 
                        Jekyll survives in yours. It would 
                        not surprise me if something deep 
                        inside him wanted to help you. He 
                        might not be able to admit it, 
                        but...well, that is just my 
                        opinion.

           Adye considers that for a moment, then stands.

                                 ADYE
                        He’s a monster, isn’t he? Even if 
                        there is good left in him.

                                 UTTERSON
                        Is the line between the two so 
                        obvious? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 UTTERSON (CONT'D)
                        Could you tell me where it lies and 
                        if you could realize when you had 
                        crossed it?

           Adye considers that silently, then turns to leave. 

                                 UTTERSON
                        Tell me, Inspector...

           Adye stops, looks back.

                                 UTTERSON
                        How are you coping with the 
                        darkness? You aren’t letting it get 
                        the best of you as I have, are you?

           Adye tries to mask how sickened he is with himself. 

           INT. DUNGEON - SCOTLAND YARD - NIGHT

           GEARS CLANK LOUDLY as the window-cover rises to reveal Jekyll 
           standing expectantly on the other side of the bars. He has a 
           bandage around one forearm and his face bears the bruises of 
           his recent pummelling at the hands of the Ripper.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Hello again, Tom. You appear to 
                        have something on your mind.

           Adye drops the stack of files on the ground. They spill, many 
           of them splashing their contents across the damp flagstones.

                                 JEKYLL
                        I see you’ve developed a flair for 
                        the dramatic. I worry that perhaps 
                        I’ve been a bad influence upon you.

           Adye doesn’t pay attention to the bait.

                                 ADYE
                        I’ve counted 71 unsolved murders in 
                        Whitechapel over the past two 
                        years, 52 of which were female 
                        victims. Of these, 38 were whores. 
                        Of these, 31 were aged 40 years or 
                        more.

                                 JEKYLL
                        You make a wonderful statistician, 
                        Tom. I wonder, what’s your point?
                                 ADYE
                        If the Ripper has indeed turned 
                        your serum -- or rather, some 
                        modified version of it -- into a 
                        recreational drug, if London’s 
                        elite are somehow encouraging its 
                        distribution, then how many of 
                        these women died to provide the 
                        necessary quantity of the chemical 
                        catalyst? Human adrenaline.

                                 JEKYLL
                        You’re suggesting the Ripper 
                        previously operated more 
                        discreetly. And with great success.

                                 ADYE
                        As Hyde once did, before reality 
                        came unwound for him. Was his final 
                        rampage so different than what 
                        we’re witnessing now?

                                 JEKYLL
                        Am I to assume you’ve also found 
                        yourself a suspect to accompany 
                        your theory?

                                 ADYE
                             (smiles)
                        Oh yes. Oh yes, indeed. 

           FLASHBACK - INT. OFFICE - SCOTLAND YARD - NIGHT

           Adye knocks on the jamb of the open door, smiling broadly at 
           the WATCH COMMANDER working at his desk inside.

                                 ADYE
                        Has he gone home for the evening?

                                 WATCH COMMANDER
                        He’s taken his family to the new 
                        waxworks exhibit at Tussaud’s. Not 
                        to be disturbed, he said, except in 
                        the case of an emergency.

                                 ADYE
                        Does the state-sanctioned murder of 
                        more than 40 women constitute an 
                        emergency?

                                 WATCH COMMANDER
                        Pardon me, sir?

                                                               BACK TO:
           INT. DUNGEON - SCOTLAND YARD

           Adye explains to Jekyll--

                                 ADYE
                        He’s the only man who had access to 
                        your research, who could’ve had the 
                        evidence logs marking its removal 
                        burned, and who had the authority 
                        to close any case the Ripper was 
                        previously involved with. 

           Jekyll slowly smiles.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Well done, Tom. Now...get me out of 
                        here. 

           INT. HALLWAY - SCOTLAND YARD - LATER

           A GUARD stands outside a metal door with a barred window in 
           it. TWO KNOCKS from the other side of it summon him. He 
           unlocks it, and lets Adye out of the dungeon.

                                 GUARD
                        I really shouldn’t’a let you down 
                        there, Inspector.

                                 ADYE
                        I appreciate it, truly.

           The guard swings the door shut and prepares to lock it again 
           when Jekyll’s face appears on the other side of the window.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Boo!

           The guard yelps, reaching for his gun -- when Adye slaps a 
           handkerchief over his face. 

           The guard is unconscious almost immediately. Adye helps him 
           to the ground as Jekyll steps out of the dungeon.

                                 ADYE
                        Was that really necessary?

                                 JEKYLL
                        How much of life is?

           He sniffs.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Chloroform? How civilized.
                                 ADYE
                        One of the two of us has to be.

           He pulls the serum case from his jacket, opens it.

                                 ADYE
                        Now let’s get you into fighting 
                        shape.

           As Jekyll reaches for the dropper--

                                 JEKYLL
                        What, no conditions this time, Tom?

           Adye hesitates, wondering about his sudden willingness to 
           dole out a serum, so linked to evil, as means to an end.

           EXT. MADAME TUSSAUD’S WAX MUSEUM - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT

           It’s been around for decades at this point, including a 
           copper dome covered in a patina of green corrosion. 

           INT. MADAME TUSSAUD’S WAX MUSEUM - CONT'D

           NEWCOMEN’S WIFE (40ish) tries to pull her TWO SONS (8 and 9) 
           apart as, behind them, Newcomen watches with an utterly 
           dispassionate expression. He couldn’t dislike his family 
           more, and is doing his best to tune them out right now. 

                                 NEWCOMEN’S SON (9)
                        I hate you!

                                 NEWCOMEN’S SON (8)
                        Papa, tell Willy I hate him more!

                                 NEWCOMEN’S WIFE
                        That’s enough out of you two. If 
                        you don’t behave, I’ll put you to 
                        the guillotine myself!

           Around them, the museum’s Chamber of Horrors and Screams: wax 
           recreations of violent moments in European history like Marie 
           Antoinette’s beheading and the torture of William Wallace.

                                 JEKYLL (O.S.)
                        Hello, Bill. 

           Newcomen eyes bulge with panic, but he doesn’t turn. Behind 
           him stand Adye and Jekyll (eyes flecked with yellow). 

                                 ADYE
                        You might want to have your family 
                        leave, Chief Inspector. Or shall I 
                        call you...Jack?
                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Beryl, take the boys outside.

           His frazzled wife has her two sons by their jackets.

                      NEWCOMEN’S WIFE
                                                        BOTH SONS
           Willie, we just got here--
                                              But, Daddy--

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        NOW!

           Newcomen watches his family hurry out, past Adye and Jekyll. 

                                 NEWCOMEN’S SON (8)
                        I hate Papa.

           Adye keeps his eyes on Newcomen during this transit (though 
           we might notice the night stick held close to his thigh now), 
           while Jekyll tussles the youngest son’s hair -- a gesture 
           that causes Newcomen’s whole body to seize with fear.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Adorable lads, Bill. I just want to 
                        eat them up, if you know what I 
                        mean.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Please, leave them out of--

           KRACKT! Adye clubs Newcomen across the side of the head with 
           his nightstick, knocking Newcomen to the ground.

                                 ADYE
                        You swore to protect lives! NOT 
                        TAKE THEM!

           Newcomen quickly tries to climb back to his feet, using a 
           platform exhibit for support. Blood running from his mouth.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        It wasn’t me, I tell you. You have 
                        to believe me.

                                 ADYE
                        Actually, I don’t. 

           Jekyll looks up at a WAXWORK RECREATION OF HYDE. This Waxwork 
           Hyde is lifting a baby over his head with one hand, having 
           just snatched it from the pram/carriage in front of him. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        Oh dear, they didn’t get it quite 
                        right. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEKYLL (CONT'D)
                             (beat, glibly)
                        There was no pram.

                                 ADYE
                        Please, stay focused.

                                 JEKYLL
                        You brought me here to keep him 
                        from escaping. The rest, including 
                        the thrashing, is your 
                        responsibility, Tom.

           Adye cracks his nightstick across Newcomen’s forearm, the one 
           Newcomen is trying to rise with the aid of. Newcomen cries 
           out in pain, dropping back to his knees.

                                 ADYE
                        I can live with that. 
                             (at Newcomen)
                        Now, tell me EVERYTHING!

           Suddenly, Newcomen drives his fist into Adye’s crotch. 

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        You’ve got the wrong man!

           Newcomen grabs Adye by an arm and pants, and heaves him like 
           a sack of grain over a railing, into exhibits. Waxworks spill 
           and break apart.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        I only ‘elped cover it up after I 
                        introduced ‘em!

           Adye slowly rises from the wreckage of broken waxworks, 
           tossing broken wax limbs at Newcomen.

                                 ADYE
                        The men who use the drug?

           Newcomen ducks around the limbs as he answers--

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        The men who distribute it. You saw 
                        some of them at the party. These 
                        are powerful people, Adye. MPs, 
                        nobility, more on the continent. 
                        The agreement was that the doctor 
                        would supply them with diluted 
                        quantities of the serum, but their 
                        demands kept him busy. 

           Adye begins moving forward, stepping over wax bodies.
                                 NEWCOMEN
                        None of them cared about a few dead 
                        whores, not if that was the only 
                        price they had to pay. 
                             (beat)
                        ‘Ell, they thought they were 
                        performing a public service by 
                        cleaning up Whitechapel.

           Jekyll has climbed up onto the exhibit level to more closely 
           examine his wax doppelganger. He’s thoroughly impressed by 
           it, almost giddily proud. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        But they’ve lost control of him, 
                        this doctor, haven’t they? He’s 
                        become something they never 
                        anticipated.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                             (guiltily)
                        Yes, ‘e’s murdering wantonly now. 
                        Enjoying it, feeding on it. The 
                        more the papers print about him, 
                        the stronger he gets.

           Adye snatches the wax baby from Waxwork Hyde’s hands, and 
           swings it like a mace by its leg into Newcomen’s head.

                                 ADYE
                        This is all your fault!

           Adye falls upon Newcomen, pounding with the wax baby until 
           the baby flies apart. Newcomen tries to crawl away, but Adye 
           seizes him by his jacket and drags him up onto the exhibit 
           floor. Toward the guillotine.

                                 ADYE
                        I want the Ripper’s name.

           He kicks a headless waxwork from the device’s saddle, freeing 
           it so he can thrown Newcomen down onto it.

                                 ADYE
                        I want his accomplices’ names.

           The shining, blood-stained guillotine blade now hangs 
           terrifyingly over Newcomen head as Adye holds him down.

                                 ADYE
                        I want to know where I can find 
                        EVERYBODY!

           “Everybody” drags out in some over-the-top Gary Oldman drawl.
                                 NEWCOMEN
                        I won’t tell you more than who the 
                        Ripper is. You have to stop 
                        him...for all of our sakes.

                                 ADYE
                        THE NAME!

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        But you already know his name. You 
                        both do.

           Jekyll watches, anxious to see Adye throw the guillotine 
           lever. Newcomen looks over at him.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        He’s been bound to our lives for 
                        five years now, Jekyll.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Do it, Tom. Do it!

           Adye kicks the lever. 

           The guillotine drops, racing toward Newcomen’s throat -- 
           which it collides with, cracking from the impact. It might 
           have been wood, but Newcomen still gasps desperately, limbs 
           splaying, from the blow to his windpipe.

                                 ADYE
                        TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND UTTERSON!

           Adye leans into the fake guillotine blade, pressing it harder 
           against Newcomen’s throat. Newcomen’s bloodshot eyes bulge as 
           he feebly claws at the blade.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        ‘E said ‘e was going to Whitechapel 
                        to...to fetch you a ginger 
                        treat...to thank you...for all the 
                        fun you’ve...you’ve given him.

           Adye stumbles back, stunned. Terrified by what Newcomen has 
           just told him.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - WHITECHAPEL - NIGHT

           From behind. The Ripper, face still hidden from us, walks 
           with Mary Jane. His black-gloved hand touches her chin as she 
           laughs like a professional at something he’s said.
                                 JEKYLL (V.O.)
                        Is he speaking of your whore, Tom?

           INT. MARY JANE’S FLAT - LATER

           The door explodes open, kicked by Adye from the outside. He 
           stomps in, revolver in hand...and freezes at what he’s 
           standing in.

           BLOOD, the crackling fireplace’s light dancing across its 
           crimson surface.

           Mary Jane’s pale arm dangles off her bed. A single line of 
           blood has run down it before splitting into tributaries about 
           the wrist, one of which pools in the cup of the palm.

           FLASH of blood splattering across the wall in a dramatic arc.

           Adye’s gasp catches in his throat.

           FLASH of more blood splattering across the wall.

           Curls of red hair spill over the edge of the bed.

           FLASH of the night table covered in a doily, upon which the 
           Ripper is setting a bloody surgical saw. There are already 
           medical tools here, all bloody so the doily is smeared red.

           Firelight catches on nascent tears in Adye’s eyes.

           FLASH of a wall, across which the shadow of the Ripper is 
           cast -- a shadow of him pulling something sausage-link-like 
           out of what we presume is Mary Jane’s abdomen.

                                 ADYE
                        I’m too late.

           FLASH of the Ripper as he washes his unseen face in a water 
           basin that sits on the dresser. His top hat and a blood-
           stained towel beside the basin.

           Adye looks down at the bloody water in the basin, sickened. 

                                 ADYE
                             (mutters)
                        It’s my fault. I should have been 
                        able to stop him before this, 
                        before...

                                 JEKYLL
                        I really do feel like an arse, 
                        having not seen this coming.
           Jekyll enters, pushing past Adye. This jars Adye out of his 
           self-recrimination.

                                 JEKYLL
                        After all, I did something similar 
                        myself when I realized how our 
                        friend Dr. Utterson looked at my 
                        Millicent. Though nothing quite 
                        this...elaborate. 
                             (gazes about)
                        Christ, this makes me look like an 
                        amateur.

                                 ADYE
                             (still dazed)
                        When did you know it was Utterson?

                                 JEKYLL
                        When you told me the reasons you 
                        believed Newcomen was the Ripper. I 
                        saw then how all the pieces 
                        assembled.

           Adye sneers at that, and stomps out.

           EXT. STREET - WHITECHAPEL - CONT'D

           Adye stalks away, checking that the cylinders of his revolver 
           are each loaded with bullets; whatever good choice Mary Jane 
           temporarily inspired him to make replaced with murderous 
           fury. Jekyll hurries after him.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Tom, wait!

                                 ADYE
                        I’m going after him, Doctor. Don’t 
                        try and stop me.

           Jekyll grabs Adye by the shoulder, spins him around.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Are you cracked? He’s stronger than 
                        you’ve ever seen me, and you’re 
                        almost certainly still addled by 
                        some naive delusion that you can 
                        arrest him.

                                 ADYE
                        Why do you care?!

                                 JEKYLL
                             (mock-hurt)
                        Because we’re mates.
                                 ADYE
                        We! Are not! Mates! 

                                 JEKYLL
                        You wound me, Tom, deeply. I am 
                        deeply wounded. But, I know how 
                        distressed you are at the moment. 
                        You’re not in your right mind. 
                        Thinking clearly, so to say. 

                                 ADYE
                        No, no, I’m thinking quite clearly. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        You forget I’m the physician, Tom, 
                        which means I’m infinitely more 
                        qualified to make these sorts of 
                        assessments. So let’s just agree to 
                        disagree for the moment, since, 
                        besides, I’m willing to help you 
                        this one last time.

                                 ADYE
                        Why would I want your help?! You’ve 
                        done nothing but lie to me. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        Because I’m your best chance of 
                        stopping him, Tom. Trust me. 

           Adye thinks. Jekyll is right, damnit, he’s always right.

                                 JEKYLL
                        But I do need to be certain you 
                        understand what must be done. There 
                        will be no headlines with your name 
                        in them for this. No glory. 
                        Utterson -- or should I say, Jack? -
                        - must be put down like a dog. A 
                        wild, rabid dog.

           Adye looks at the revolver in his hands.

                                 JEKYLL
                        There is no reasoning with him. 
                        There is no saving him. Do you 
                        understand me?

           Adye looks up, murderous determination in his eyes.

                                 ADYE
                        Yes. Which means...
           He hands the revolver to Jekyll, who holds it almost as if 
           it’s revolting to him, an impersonal method of killing. Adye 
           reaches into his jacket, producing the serum case.

                                 ADYE
                        ...you’ll need more of this.

           Adye draws a serum vial out, already screwing the top off. 
           The serum dropper glows with the yellow fluid inside.

                                 JEKYLL
                        I’ll need more a lot more than a 
                        drop or two more, Tom. I’ll need 
                        all of it if you want me to even 
                        approach Jack’s strength.

           Adye backs away, turning so his body is between Jekyll and 
           the vial’s contents.

                                 ADYE
                        But Hyde, you’ll lose yourself to 
                        him again. You’ll forget who you 
                        are. I won’t do that to you.

                                 JEKYLL
                        I can control him, Tom, I know I 
                        can. Besides, it’s my choice. You 
                        always found a way to justify my 
                        help before. Do it again...for your 
                        Mary Jane.

           Adye considers this for a moment. Turns to face Jekyll.

                                 ADYE
                        Utterson was right about you. I 
                        wish I had known you before, 
                        Doctor, before your ambition to do 
                        good became the window through 
                        which Hyde crawled into your soul.

           He finally holds out the serum vial itself. Jekyll gently 
           takes it from him, his fingers grazing Adye’s in an almost 
           sexual exchange. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        I don’t. I killed just about 
                        everyone I used to know.

           He downs the whole serum like a shot.

           Adye panics when Jekyll’s eyes bulge and his body seizes.
           Jekyll shakes violently, serum-yellow foam around his mouth. 
           His eyes turn entirely yellow, not just flecked. Veins and 
           tendons pop. Hair grows across the back of his hands.

                                 ADYE
                        Jekyll. Jekyll!

           Jekyll throws his head back, foam still around his mouth as 
           he tears his shirt open. 

           And then the agonized groans emanating from him begin to 
           twist...into something like LAUGHTER. 

                                 ADYE
                        Jekyll?

           Jekyll places a hand on Adye’s shoulder in that way that 
           people do when they’re laughing too hard. When they’re 
           laughing hysterically. 

                                 JEKYLL
                        Oh Gawd, it hurts, it hurts. Why 
                        aren’t you laughing, Tom?

                                 ADYE
                             (confused)
                        Perhaps because I don’t understand 
                        the joke, Jekyll.

                                 JEKYLL
                        Please don’t call me that anymore, 
                        Tom. Jekyll was weak, pathetic, 
                        and, let’s be honest now, didn’t 
                        have the stones necessary to be 
                        half the twisted fiend he really 
                        was inside. 

           HYDE, not Jekyll, leans back against a brick wall to catch 
           his breath after his laughing fit. He’s still smiling.

                                 HYDE
                        He murdered far more than I ever 
                        did, just so he could slip me on 
                        like a coat whenever he needed an 
                        excuse. Who do you think harvested 
                        all that adrenaline? Luckily, I’ve 
                        been rid of him for years. No more 
                        masks now.
                             (beat)
                        Just. Hyde. 

           Adye steps back, disgusted but not necessarily feeling 
           betrayed. Unsure is more like it.
                                 ADYE
                        If you’ve been Hyde this whole 
                        time, what could you have possibly 
                        hoped to gain that you couldn’t 
                        have taken at any of a dozen other 
                        opportunities? Is it Utterson? Some 
                        twisted plot for vengeance?

                                 HYDE
                        I’m disappointed in you, Tom, 
                        truly. Vengeance? How petty. I’m 
                        after Jacky Boy’s super-serum. I 
                        couldn’t bear it if I was only 
                        remembered as the second-worst 
                        villain London has ever faced.

           He throws up a theatrical hand. 

                                 HYDE
                        Call it a point of professional 
                        pride, Tom, but I want it to be my 
                        name that sends shivers down their 
                        spines and keeps their little ones 
                        up at night.

           HOLD on Adye, deeply disturbed by such a thought.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hyde lifts a heavy manhole cover from the street and easily 
           casts it aside. Adye watches, his revolver ready.

                                 HYDE
                        This way, his stench is 
                        unmistakable.

           INT. SEWERS - CONT'D

           Hyde drops into the tunnel, landing ankle-deep in water and 
           who knows what else. He’s immediately splashing forward, 
           after his prey.

           Adye lands behind him, less gracefully. 

                                 ADYE
                        Doctor, wait for me.

           He reaches into his jacket and produces a box of matches, 
           but, with his revolver in his hand, fumbles to light one. 
           They fall from his fingers, disappearing in the water below.

                                 ADYE
                        Wait!
           He starts forward, the SLOSHING WATER below him reverberating 
           through the tunnel so it’s difficult to keep track of sounds.

                                 ADYE
                        I cannot see my nose in front of my 
                        face, Dr. Jekyll.

           Suddenly, Hyde emerges from the darkness. Barely visible, but 
           enough so to scare the hell out of Adye

                                 HYDE
                        Hyde, Tom. Call me Mr. Hyde.

                                 ADYE
                        I could call you Eloise, but that 
                        wouldn’t change my blindness, you 
                        homicidal lunatic. 

           Hyde considers that for a moment, then smiles.

                                 HYDE
                        You know, Tom, you’re a good mate. 

           He pats Adye on the arm, then vanishes back into the 
           darkness.

                                 HYDE (O.S.)
                        Stay close to me. I won’t let 
                        anything happen to you.

           Adye doesn’t move.

                                 ADYE
                        I still can’t see anything, Hyde.

           With a sigh, he moves into the darkness that reveals, only 
           occasional, hints of him or Hyde. He must shout over the 
           ECHOING SLOSHING.

                                 ADYE
                        Mr. Hyde?!

           No reply.

                                 ADYE
                        Blast it, where did you go?!

           Still no reply. Adye stops.

                                 ADYE
                        You’ve left, haven’t you? You took 
                        the serum and ran away, and I 
                        helped you do it.
           His SLOSHING has dissipated to almost-silence.

                                 ADYE
                        HYDE!

                                 THE RIPPER (O.S.)
                        Hello, Inspector Adye. It’s so good 
                        to see you again.

           Adye looks about, swiveling his revolver this way and that. 
           Barely visible in the darkness that swallows up everything.

                                 ADYE
                        Dr. Utterson?

                                 THE RIPPER (O.S.)
                        Has gone to lunch at the moment. A 
                        very, very long lunch. 

                                 ADYE
                        What are you going to do with me?

                                 THE RIPPER (O.S.)
                        Mourn your loss. I don’t know how 
                        else I could have kept myself so 
                        entertained these past few months.

           Listen carefully and you’ll get the sense that the Ripper is 
           getting closer. A few PLINKS in the water. SQUEALING rats. 
           Adye notices this, turning his head at each almost-sound.

                                 ADYE
                        You could just let me go.

                                 THE RIPPER (O.S.)
                        I considered it, to let the Game 
                        continue a bit longer, but, alas, I 
                        think I require a holiday. Perhaps 
                        to New York City. Have you ever 
                        been?

           Yellow eyes, glowing slightly, open in the darkness behind 
           Adye who, sensing the presence, spins around.

           Suddenly, he’s lit up by flashes from his firing revolver -- 
           BANG! BANG! The outline of the Ripper’s jacket and top hat 
           faintly visible, passing quickly in front of him.

           A third gunshot lights up the Ripper’s murderous face. This 
           is our first time seeing Utterson as the Ripper -- and he’s 
           got a large scalpel in his hand, ready to attack with.
           Adye gets off one more shot, but it’s in the wrong direction. 
           The Ripper has swooped around him, left arm around Adye’s 
           neck as his right hand stabs the scalpel into Adye’s side.

           Adye’s trailing scream ECHOES through the dark tunnels before 
           being lost amidst the vast network. All that’s left is the 
           eerie sound of still water and CHITTERING rats.

           BLACK

           Somewhere, the sound of chugging INDUSTRIAL PUMPS. 

           Through Adye’s BLEARY CONSCIOUSNESS, we get POV glimpses of--

           Adye being dragged past large red pipes.

                                 ADYE (O.S.)
                        Whu...whu is that smell?

           His own handcuffs being pulled from his jacket and locked 
           around a wrist.

                                 ADYE (O.S.)
                        Where am I?

           A hooked needle being looped through his abdominal skin, 
           iodine stains where the wound has been cleaned.

                                 THE RIPPER (O.S.)
                        Shh, you’ve lost a lot of blood.

                                 ADYE (O.S.)
                        Wha are you doing?

           Hands carefully tying the sutures off.

                                 THE RIPPER (O.S.)
                        Saving your life, I thought that 
                        would be obvious.

           SLOWLY FADE IN:

           INT. ABBEY MILLS PUMPING STATION - LATER

           ADYE’S POV: All around us, steam. Pumps, machinery, and 
           bridgeways painted red in this multi-level warehouse-sized 
           subterranean world that, for some bizarre historical reason, 
           was designed for elegance despite its purpose.

           Adye has just woke, his face dirtied by sweat and grime. Hair 
           tacked to his forehead. 
                                 THE RIPPER (O.S.)
                        Welcome back to the land of the 
                        living, Inspector. For now.

           Adye dangles from a pipe that his wrists are handcuffed 
           around. His coat and jacket have been removed, his shirt torn 
           open so his blood-smeared stomach is visible.

                                 THE RIPPER (O.S.)
                        I do hope the sutures don’t sting 
                        too much. 

           Adye looks around for the voice...and finds the Ripper 
           standing at a railing some five feet away. His top hat gone, 
           collar open. Removing one of his black gloves.

                                 ADYE
                        What is this place?

           Utterson/The Ripper’s face looks more full of vigor than when 
           we last saw him, the serum’s influence. Eyes yellow.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        The Abbey Mills Pumping Station, 
                        have you heard of it?

                                 ADYE
                             (slowly nods)
                        I think so.

           The Ripper sets the one glove down, begins peeling off the 
           other.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        The modern metropolis, I've heard 
                        it said, now shares more in common 
                        with biological organisms than 
                        cities of the past, this given the 
                        complexity of their 
                        infrastructures. 

           He sets his gloves atop a metal tray that’s been welded to 
           one of the railings. The gloves rest atop Adye’s revolver, 
           which Adye sees now.

                                 THE RIPPER 
                        But if this is true, and London's 
                        streets and sewers are its 
                        circulatory system, then the blood 
                        coursing through its veins, driving 
                        its existence, is--
                             (sniffs)
                        --shit.
           He indicates the chugging pumps that work above huge holding 
           tanks of RAW SEWAGE. 

                                 THE RIPPER 
                        Tens of thousands of gallons of 
                        excrement passes through London 
                        every day, threatening to drown us 
                        in our own waste. We breathe it, we 
                        consume food fertilized by it. It 
                        is, I think, what we are. 

           He opens his coat so that his knife rig is visible.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        The things I have done, Inspector, 
                        what difference could they make? 

           He draws a large scalpel from his rig. Smiling mischievously.

                                 THE RIPPER 
                        When I am gone, everything will 
                        still be shit, and nothing you ever 
                        do will change that.

           He begins approaching Adye.

                                 ADYE
                        Uh-huh, sure. Civilization has 
                        turned to rubbish-- 

                                 THE RIPPER
                        Shit.

                                 ADYE
                        Whatever. It doesn’t deserve to go 
                        on. Man neither, I’ve heard it all 
                        before. But I don’t buy it. I 
                        won’t. I’ve seen things, horrors as 
                        you called them. Things I’ll never 
                        be able to unknow, but I’ve seen 
                        other things as well. Beauty where 
                        it shouldn’t exist.

           FLASH of MARY JANE smiling sweetly at him in the alley where 
           they had their first conversation.

                                 ADYE
                        I’ll choose that world over yours, 
                        if it’s all the same to you. So go 
                        on, get it over with already. 

           The Ripper draws the scalpel down Adye’s chest, out of 
           frustration, but definitely not the death blow Adye expected.
                                 THE RIPPER
                        Oh not yet, Inspector, not yet. It 
                        wouldn’t do not to have you bear 
                        witness to my ultimate victory over 
                        our friend Jekyll, especially after 
                        all the good time the three of us 
                        have shared. But don’t worry 
                        yourself now. He’ll be along 
                        momentarily.

           Adye notices the shadow emerging through the steam behind the 
           Ripper, as if something has leapt from a bridgeway above. 
           With an almost-smile on his face--

                                 ADYE
                        Oh, sooner than that, I’d say.

           Hyde drops from above, an arm drawn back, ready to slash. 

                                 HYDE
                        JAAAAACCCCKKKKKK!

           The Ripper looks up, teeth bared, one arm already throwing 
           back to attack with the scalpel its hand holds. 

           Hyde and the Ripper crash to the ground, rolling as...

           Hyde bites into the Ripper’s neck like a wild beast...

           And the Ripper repeatedly stabs his scalpel into Hyde’s side.

           The Ripper uses the kinetic energy of the roll to throw/kick 
           Hyde (scalpel still stuck in Hyde) into a brick column that 
           partially crumbles from the impact. 

           Hyde stands just in time to lean his body out of the way of a 
           right hook from the Ripper that tears through more of the 
           column. Brick and mortar explodes.

                                 HYDE
                        I’ve been looking forward to this 
                        for five years.

           The Ripper spins around, arm out, a second medical knife in 
           his hand that, despite Hyde’s attempt to fall away from it, 
           slashes through Hyde’s shirt and chest. Blood splatters.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        I shan't make it easy for you.

                                 HYDE
                        I should hope not -- arrgh!
           The Ripper stabs the knife down into Hyde’s collarbone even 
           as Hyde slugs him in ribs that CRUNCH. 

           A kick to the Ripper’s chest sends him crashing through 
           several pipes that, once torn apart, spew tremendous steam. 
           He rises, face and hands blistering from the heat.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        Do you still remember what it was 
                        like the first time you injected 
                        yourself with the serum, Jekyll? I 
                        do. 

           He moves slowly through the spreading cloud, searching for 
           Jekyll in it. 

                                 THE RIPPER
                        As soon as the initially agony 
                        subsided, I woke as if from a 
                        dream. I immediately and without 
                        confusion knew myself to be more 
                        wicked, tenfold more wicked, a 
                        thought I delighted in like wine. 
                        Jack was born then, but that wasn’t 
                        enough. 

           Adye struggles with his handcuffs and the pipe he hangs from, 
           trying to find some way to free himself as he listens to the 
           Ripper try to bait Hyde out.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        I grew to loathe Utterson, his 
                        weaknesses, his misguided sense of 
                        propriety. I wanted to be rid of 
                        him, once and for all, and so I 
                        began work on your serum. I pushed 
                        it as far as it could go, until 
                        Utterson simply...disappeared. Only 
                        Jack remained, and the ecstacy of 
                        the serum. The power it gave me. 
                        You know what I’m speaking of, 
                        don’t you, Jekyll? 

           FROM INSIDE THE CLOUD, JEKYLL’S POV: He slowly stalks the 
           Ripper, moving silently.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        But it’s worse for me. My body 
                        seems not enough to contain the 
                        raging energies of life it bestows 
                        upon me. 

           The Ripper trembles, as if those raging energies are 
           threatening to erupt even now.
                                 THE RIPPER
                        I burn all the time. My thoughts 
                        are like fire. Can you hear me, 
                        Jekyll? CAN YOU HEAR ME, JEKYLL?! 

           Hyde lunges out of the cloud-- 

                                 HYDE
                        They call me HYYYYDDDE!

           --and pummels the Ripper with blow after massive blow. 
           Blinded by his berserker rage, though, he finally swings 
           wide. The Ripper ducks and spins around so that he’s got Hyde 
           by his belt and arm before Hyde knows what’s happening.

           Hyde is now thrown through 40 feet through the air, body 
           spinning ungracefully, right over top of the sewage vats. 
           Heading right for a wall and large pump.

           The Ripper is already bounding across pipes that pass above 
           the sewage vats when Hyde crashes into the large pump, 
           mangling it and its pipes. 

                                 THE RIPPER
                        If you be Hyde, then I shall be 
                        Seek!

           He leaps for the kill as Hyde rises from the wreckage, and 
           swings a huge pipe like a bat.

           The Ripper is swatted like a ball, right back across the 
           sewage vats so that he crashes through pipes and into 
           machinery around Adye.

           Adye’s pipe BREAKS LOOSE, but not completely free.

           Adye’s revolver topples to the grated floor not far from 
           where Adye is now trying to get free.

           The Ripper, blistered and bloody, struggles to rise amidst 
           steam and metal wreckage. He looks up, fear in his eyes--

           --as well as the REFLECTION of Hyde bending down over him.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        No, not like this.

           Hyde falls atop the Ripper, one hand around the Ripper’s 
           throat, the other slugging him over and over.

                                 HYDE
                        Where is it, Jack? Where is it?!
           Adye has managed to work his handcuffs to where the pipe has 
           broken away from its pump. Is almost free now.

           Hyde kicks another pipe loose, so that steam hisses out 
           across the Ripper’s face. Hyde keeps the Ripper pinned there, 
           choking him as the Ripper’s face slowly burns.

                                 HYDE
                        I want the formula. WHERE IS IT?!

           The Ripper shakes, his yellow eyes bulging almost impossibly.

                                 THE RIPPER
                        In my of...fice...behind the...the
                        BoschAHHHHHHHHH!

                                 ADYE (O.S.)
                        Hyde.

           Hyde looks up at Adye, who’s standing ten feet away -- still 
           handcuffed, but holding his revolver now. Covered in grime 
           and blood splatter, he’s the vision of a man pushed to the 
           edge. 

           At the sight of this, Hyde stands suddenly, dragging the 
           Ripper with him.

                                 ADYE
                        Hyde!

           The Ripper -- face and hair melted -- is thrown over the 
           railing, where he swings. Dangling from Hyde’s one hand.

                                 HYDE
                        All you have to do is say, “Don't.”

           Adye considers the two knives still sticking out of Hyde. The 
           rest of Hyde’s injuries.

                                 HYDE
                        Come on, Tom, say it with me: 
                        “Don’t do it, Hyde.”

           CLOSE on Hyde, smirking. He’s pushing Adye to make one final 
           choice now. It’s always been about choice, in fact.

                                 HYDE
                        If you don’t try to stop me, you 
                        become an accomplice. You become as 
                        much his murderer as me.

           BLAM! BLAM!
           Adye stares down his smoking revolver at Hyde’s surprised 
           face, two splotches of blood already appearing on Hyde’s 
           chest. 

           The Ripper drops from Hyde’s weakened grasp. Screaming as he 
           falls.

           His body splashes into the shit below, quickly vanished in 
           the disgusting goop.

           Hyde leans against the rail behind him, perhaps to hold 
           himself up.

                                 HYDE
                        I'm proud as...punch...of you, Tom. 
                        Not bad at all.

           Adye still staring down the barrel of his revolver.

                                 ADYE
                        There was no reasoning with him, no 
                        saving him.

           He’s repeating the words Hyde used to describe going after 
           the Ripper. Hyde realizes this and smiles with placid 
           resignation.

                                 HYDE
                        No...no, there wasn't. 

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

           Hyde is shot three more times, knocked backwards by the force 
           of the bullets. He spills over the railing.

           Adye still staring down the barrel of his revolver, 
           unreactive. Almost robotic.

           A spray of shit rises into his POV, from Hyde’s off-screen 
           splash-down.

           And now the revolver in Adye’s hand begins to shake, the hand 
           holding it trembling.

           All of a sudden, everything Adye’s been through catches up 
           with him, and he slumps to the floor. Exhausted.

           EXT. THAMES RIVER - DAWN

           The river Thames, Victorian London along its banks. The sun 
           is currently rising on a new day for the city as sewage 
           discharged by the pumping station is carried toward the sea. 

           A muck-covered body floats facedown in the shit.
           INT. OFFICE - HOSPITAL - DAY

           The door, closed. But we can hear a key in the lock, and now 
           it opens so a dim-witted CUSTODIAN and Adye can enter.

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        This in’t normally allowed, 
                        Inspector -- Christ, i’s freezing 
                        in here.

           He goes right to the window, which is open, while Adye, grime 
           half-smeared away from his face and wearing a fresh jacket 
           over his soiled, shredded clothes, heads straight for the 
           BOSCH PAINTING that hangs behind the desk.

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        Dr. Utterson knows better than to 
                        leave windows open this time’a
                        year.

           He closes the window, only to realize his fingers have slid 
           through some sort of brown goop smeared along the frame.

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        What the...?

           Adye, pale and bleary eyed, looks over. He’s just removed the 
           painting from the wall, revealing a safe.

                                 ADYE
                        What is it?

           The custodian sniffs at his fingers, reels back from them. 

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        I’s shite, sir.

           Adye’s eyes go wide, and he spins to check the safe -- that 
           he now sees isn’t closed all the way. Almost, but not quite.

                                 ADYE
                        No.

           Inside the safe: almost black, except for a crack of light 
           illuminating a bit of paper.

           The safe’s door opens now, revealing SHIT SMUDGES on its 
           inside. Adye’s eyes look anguished by what he’s found here, 
           TEARS threatening to run.

                                 ADYE
                        I must have just missed him.
                                 CUSTODIAN
                        Pardon, sir?

           Inside the safe is a single piece of folded paper, Adye’s 
           name scrawled across the outside. Waiting for him to find it.

           Adye draws it out, opening it. Fecal fingerprints here and 
           there.

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        What is it, sir?

           The note reads: 

           T.

           “When the character of a man is not clear, look at his 
           friends.” 

           H.

           Adye’s head falls forward.

                                 ADYE
                        He wants me to know he’s not going 
                        to hold a grudge.

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        Sir?

           But Adye is laughing now. Laughing with relief.

           The custodian shakes his head, deciding this inspector is off 
           his rocker, and walks out.

           As Adye continues to laugh--

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        In the weeks that followed, 
                        numerous prominent Londoners 
                        unexpectedly met their ends.

           INT. DINING ROOM - LONDON HOUSE - NIGHT

           A gentleman’s well-polished dinner table, the GENTLEMAN 
           (still in his robes) slumped face-first in a bowl of soup 
           that’s splattered everywhere.

           EXT. STREET - LONDON - DAY

           An overturned phaeton, the LEGS OF A GENTLEMAN visible behind 
           it.
                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        I recognized all as guests at 
                        Griffyn House that night Elizabeth 
                        Stride and Catherine Eddowes were 
                        murdered.

           INT. FOYER - LONDON HOUSE - NIGHT

           A GENTLEMAN lies in a tangled mess at the bottom of 
           magnificent marble stairs.

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        Hyde was sending a message to them.

           EXT. STREET - LONDON - NIGHT

           FIREMEN shoot water at a blazing building facade.

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        This message wasn’t defined, but 
                        perhaps it had something to do with 
                        never again meddling with his 
                        serum.

           EXT. STREET - LONDON - DAY

           A GENTLEMAN and WIFE out for a sidewalk stroll -- when a 
           GRAND PIANO lands on top of them.

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        I like to think the good man that 
                        was Jekyll, trapped somewhere 
                        inside Hyde, had had enough of 
                        their abuses in Whitechapel. 

           INT. BATHROOM - LONDON HOUSE - DAY

           Lord Burton floats dead in a brass tub, his face (and empty 
           blue eyes) framed by soapy water. 

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        That perhaps Whitechapel had 
                        suffered enough. 
                             (beat)
                        And then one day it was over.

           EXT. HYDE PARK - DAY

           Just another quiet day, LONDONERS of all ranks strolling 
           casually along. Birds SINGING.
                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        London’s gentry, the true villains 
                        in this whole charade, went back to 
                        sleeping well in their silk 
                        pajamas. Hyde...had gone.

           EXT. RURAL SCOTLAND PUB - NIGHT

           A sign with a lamb on it hangs over the door.

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        Though, as I learned later, there 
                        was one more loose end he had to 
                        tie up.

           INT. RURAL SCOTLAND PUB - CONT'D

           The gruff BARTENDER and a couple PATRONS turn, glaring, when 
           Newcomen -- his throat bandaged up from where it was injured 
           at Tussaud’s -- enters. Dripping wet. 

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        Please tell me you’ve a kitchen. 
                        I’m famished.

                                 BARTENDER
                        I’ve got a kitchen, aye, if you’ve 
                        got something to pay with.

           Newcomen drops into a high-backed wood booth. Wrings water 
           from his hat as he waits.

           The bartender drops a pint mug onto the table, passing away 
           immediately. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        You’ll get your stew when it’s 
                        ready.

           Newcomen shrugs off the rudeness, more interested in that 
           pint that he pulls closer to himself. Begins to lift it when--

                                 HYDE (O.S.)
                        Good evening, Bill.

           Newcomen goes white and the ale that should have made it into 
           his mouth pours into his lap before he can set the mug down.

                                 NEWCOMEN
                        You.

           Hyde, face hidden from us, sits across from Newcomen. Tosses
           a cloth napkin his way as he does this.
                                 HYDE
                        I believe we have unconcluded
                        business.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           BLACK

           FADE IN:

           EXT. RURAL VILLAGE - DAY

           A carriage door opens, and two feet in shiny black shoes step 
           out -- right into mud that splatters over them.

           Adye sighs at the mess, but, unlike earlier in the movie, 
           doesn’t feel the need to wipe them clean. 

           The DRIVER begins unloading Adye’s luggage as Ayde looks 
           around at the dirty, gray community filled with RUSTIC SORTS 
           who eye him skeptically.

                                 DRIVER
                        All the way from London, eh, sir? 

                                 ADYE
                        Whitechapel, actually. 

           INT. CHIEF CONSTABLE’S OFFICE - CONSTABULARY - LATER

           Adye, shoes still mucked, stands stiffly before the desk of 
           the county’s chain-smoking CHIEF CONSTABLE (late-40s). 

                                 CHIEF CONSTABLE
                        I know all about you, Inspector. 
                        The Ripper cock-up. Allowing your 
                        Mr. Hyde to escape. You’re an 
                        embarrassment to your profession.

                                 ADYE
                        Quite so, yes, sir.

                                 CHIEF INSPECTOR
                        This transfer wasn’t of your 
                        choosing.

                                 ADYE
                        No, but the events that 
                        precipitated it very much were.

           The Chief Constable studies Adye for a minute, smoking.
                                 CHIEF CONSTABLE
                        Well, I’m stuck with you now, 
                        aren’t I?
                             (blows smoke)
                        Might as well find a use for your 
                        particular...talents.

           Adye considers that for a beat. An eyebrow rises.

                                 ADYE
                        Sir?

                                 CHIEF CONSTABLE
                        There have been some strange goings-
                        on of late in these parts I admit 
                        I’m at a loss to explain.

           He tosses a file across his desk, at Adye.

                                 CHIEF CONSTABLE (CONT’D)
                        Take this one.

           Adye looks down at the papers that have slid out of the file. 
           Several photos of broken, bloody bodies stare back him.

                                 CHIEF CONSTABLE (CONT’D)
                        Witnesses claim the assailant was 
                        an invisible man, if you can 
                        believe such nonsense. 

           Adye’s eyes open noticeably at the word “invisible.”

           EXT. RURAL VILLAGE - LATER

           Adye exits the constabulary, looking around at this village 
           and its modern peasant class. 

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        Britain’s menagerie of freaks and 
                        oddities is about to get bigger, I 
                        fear.

           He tightens his scarf. Looks both ways as the wind whips at 
           him.

                                 ADYE (V.O.)
                        Hopefully Hyde doesn’t mind the 
                        competition, but if he does...

           Now he looks up -- speaking directly at US.
                                 ADYE
                        ...I’ll be waiting.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           BLACK

           CREDITS ROLL

                                         THE END.
