                                 November 2nd, 2010
           We begin with a DISCLAIMER:

           “The following is kind-of based on a true story a little 
           bit.”

           The words are lifted away in a haze of CIGARETTE SMOKE.

           INT. CHIME MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY (1967)

           Snapshots from an office of a bustling late 60’s music 
           magazine:

           - MULTIPLE CIGARETTES, all being smoked indoors. Smoke 
           wafts over cubicles, everywhere.

           - FEET in four-inch PLATFORM SHOES.  Women AND men.

           - Music POSTERS and SIGNAGE line cubicle walls. Hendrix.  
           Dylan.  Simon and a Jew-fro’d Garfunkel.

           - MINI-SKIRTS.  Really “mini” mini-skirts.

           - A poster of a young RICHARD NIXON.  Someone has drawn a 
           MUSTACHE on Nixon’s face as well as a “SPEECH BUBBLE” 
           which reads “I’m an asshole.”

           - We hone in on a SINGLE CIGARETTE, as the hand holding 
           it reaches over a cubicle wall and ashes on the floor.  

           The hand returns inside the safe confines of its cubicle.  

           INT. CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS

           Still following that cigarette.  It gets set down, on a 
           desk, as the hand picks up a small, old TAPE RECORDER.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                                 (re: recording)
                        This cool?

                                 SECOND VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sure.

           A PACK OF CIGARETTES are held forward.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Smoke?

                                 SECOND VOICE (O.S.)
                        No thanks.

           The pack is pulled back REVEALING for the first time:

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           OUR INTERVIEWER, GUY DELOACH (36).  His style is of the 
           day and his manner that of a hippie who thinks he knows 
           everything about anything worth knowing.

           DeLoach leans back in his seat.  He takes a long drag on 
           his cigarette as he studies the YOUNG MAN opposite him. 

           ON THIS YOUNG MAN.

           Throughout, we see him only in FACELESS SNAPSHOTS.  

           - Long hair, very much of the era.

           - Open collared shirt.  A hairless chest.

           - A single gold cross on the hairless chest.

           - Those few facial features we can make out are boyish, 
           untouched by... well, anything.

           BACK TO DELOACH.

                                 DELOACH
                        Jesus H, you’re a baby.  What are 
                        you, sixteen?

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Nineteen.

                                 DELOACH
                        Jesus H.

           DeLoach takes another drag.  A beat, then he smiles.

                                 DELOACH (CONT’D)
                        Well it’s a hell of an album, Kid. 
                        People are going to freak.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Thank you.

                                 DELOACH
                        Who got you there?

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        I’m sorry?

                                 DELOACH
                        Your influences.  Who do you dig? 
                        Who makes you hard?

                                 YOUNG MAN
                                 (uncomfortable)
                        Oh, well, I--

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 DELOACH
                        Hold on.

           DeLoach picks up the recorder, speaks into it.

                                 DELOACH (CONT’D)
                        June 30th, 1967, Guy DeLoach with 
                        Danny Collins for Chime Mag, go 
                        ahead.

           A beat of silence.

                                 DANNY
                        Me go ahead?

                                 DELOACH
                        Yes.

                                 DANNY
                        Oh, well, I don’t know, really.  I 
                        listen to everything so--

                                 DELOACH
                        There’s the Dylan comparison 
                        obviously.  The singer-songwriter 
                        thing.  Stripped down. Raw. 
                                 (then)
                        You’re seriously nineteen?

           In profile, Danny NODS.

                                 DELOACH (CONT’D)
                        More than anything it’s the 
                        writing.  You write like fucking 
                        Lennon man.

                                 DANNY
                        Oh, well, that’s... thank you. 

                                 DELOACH
                        He’s clearly an influence here, 
                        no?

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, I mean... I guess he’s the 
                        one who makes me the hardest?

           A beat.  DeLoach LAUGHS, shakes his head.

                                 DELOACH
                        Jesus H.  Well, you’re going to be 
                        huge, Kid.  I know the real thing 
                        when I hear it and you’re it.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Danny doesn’t say anything.  DeLoach raises a brow.

                                 DELOACH (CONT’D)
                        Kid, look at me.  I’ve been a star-
                        maker and a star-fucker for a very 
                        long time, and I’m telling you: 
                        You.  Are.  Going.  To.  Be.  
                        Huge. Richer than richer, famous 
                        as shit, more women than you know 
                        what to do with.  And I’m telling 
                        you this, and I’ve got to ask: why 
                        are you sitting there, staring at 
                        me, looking like that information 
                        scares the living shit out of you?

           Danny leans forward, full-frame for the first time.

                                 DANNY
                        Because it does.

           CUE TITLE CARD:        

                                  IMAGINE

           We FADE BACK IN on the sound of A DULL, THUMPING ROAR.  
           THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.  A distant crowd awaits their star.

           CHYRON: 43 YEARS LATER.

           EXT. THE NEW MEADOWLANDS STADIUM - EVENING

           A large marquee outside bears only four words:

           Danny Collins.  Sold Out.

           AROUND THE PARKING LOT

           Late STRAGGLERS hustle in toward the stadium.  The crowd 
           we see, generally, feels... well, older.

           In fact, OLDER FOLKS abound.  Many carry blankets.  Seat 
           cushions.  A few argue about which entrance to go into.

           We spot FOUR YOUNGER PEOPLE racing toward the stadium 
           (TWO GUYS, TWO GIRLS).  They’re drinking beer from cans.

                                 GUY #1
                        So we’re really going in?

           CONTINUED:

                                 GIRL #1
                        Honestly, I don’t know if I can go 
                        through with this.

                                 GUY #2
                        Guys, this is going to be fucking 
                        hysterical, just trust me.

           INT. THE NEW MEADOWLANDS STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

           The chanting crowd continues.

                                 CROWD
                        Dan-ny!  Dan-ny!  Dan-ny!

           An OLDER WOMAN holds up a sign reading, “THIS GRANNY 
           LOVES DANNY.”

           EXT. DRESSING ROOM - MEANWHILE

           A sign on the door reads: HEADLINER.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - MEANWHILE

           A WORN HAND fingers a CROSS.  

           The cross dangles from a chain, half buried in a patch of 
           grey chest hair.

           The cross is removed, placed on a table.

           The cross OPENS, like a coffin.  It gets turned upside-
           down, dumping a line of COCAINE on a table.

           A NOSE comes into frame, snorts some.

           INT. TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           From behind, an ENTOURAGE marches down the tunnel, 
           enveloping the star.  The CHANTING CROWD grows closer.

           ON HIS FEET

           Black PLATFORM SHOES, providing him a solid five inches.  
           His steps are wobbly, not exactly in a straight line.

           AT THE STAGE CURTAIN 

           From behind, we watch as this WHITE-SUITED FIGURE pauses.  
           He finishes off a bottle of BEER, hands it to someone.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           One deep breath.  One crack of the neck, each way.  Then:

                                 DANNY
                        Yep.

           He goes through the curtain.  From behind the curtain, we 
           hear the crowd instantly go APESHIT.

           EXT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           We see DANNY COLLINS (now in his 60’s) for the first time 
           since he was nineteen.

           He’s still a striking man, but the years have definitely 
           left their mark... and all the make-up in the world can’t 
           hide it (though not for lack of trying).

           He wears a stark white suit, black shirt, and those black 
           platform shoes. Equal parts Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond.

           He approaches the mic.  Smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        Thanks for coming.  

           The crowd ROARS approval.  Danny nods.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I think you might know this one.

           Danny turns to his BAND behind him.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        One, two, three, four!

           LIGHTS BLAST ON!!!  Everywhere.  The BAND begins playing 
           as the crowd ERUPTS.

           During the song: VIDEO SCREENS do their best to overload 
           senses.  PRE-RECORDED IMAGES of Danny play everywhere: 
           singing, dancing, occasionally winking.  

           This is over-the-top spectacle... but not caricature.  
           The music, the act, it’s cheesy without being cartoony, 
           campy without being completely void of melody.  

           It’s pretty clear that the stadium isn’t the only thing 
           that has sold out.

           Danny has clearly lead off with his biggest hit, akin to 
           Sweet Caroline (equally catchy, almost as good).  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Sweet Caroline is a good reference actually, mainly 
           because from the first note (and especially the chorus), 
           the audience is SINGING ALONG in a call and response 
           fashion.

           ON DANNY 

           As he performs, taking in the crowd in slow motion.

           ON CROWD

           AN OLDER COUPLE, arm and arm, SING the response part of 
           the song back at him.  They’re singing way too hard.

           THREE OLDER WOMEN sit quietly in their front row seats, 
           eating RED VINES and mouthing words along, lifeless.

           A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE sing along with energy... but 
           they’re LAUGHING.  They’re not laughing with Danny.

           ON DANNY

           He’s seen it all a thousand times.  It no longer phases 
           him.  

           He pivots with a little shimmy, keeps performing.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - HOURS LATER.

           Danny’s dressing room has transformed into an AFTER-
           PARTY.  HANGER-ONS are everywhere.  Drinking, smoking, 
           making a mess of the place.

           Everyone’s a solid twenty to thirty years younger than 
           Danny.  At least.

           OFF TO THE SIDE

           A MAN in an expensive suit drinks from a BOTTLE OF WATER, 
           watches it all.  This is FRANK GRUBMAN (50’s).  

           He looks...

           ACROSS THE ROOM (FRANK’S POV)

           At Danny, holding court for a small group of SYCOPHANTS 
           and doing his best to stay awake.  He’s drinking 
           EXPENSIVE SCOTCH and fingering his cross.

           A THIRTY-SOMETHING kneels beside Danny, asking (clearly) 
           to snap a picture of them on his CELL PHONE.  Danny 
           shakes his head no, the guy takes the picture anyway.

           Danny shrugs it off, takes another sip of scotch.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           BACK TO FRANK

           He’s seen enough.  He heads over, sits next to Danny.

                                 FRANK
                        How you doin’, Kid?

                                 DANNY
                        Peachy, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        It was a good show.

                                 DANNY
                        Inspired.

           Frank tilts his head, takes Danny in.

                                 FRANK
                        Hey, Sylvia Plath?  You okay? 

                                 DANNY
                        I’m fine.
                                 (then, admitting)
                        Birthday blues or some shit I 
                        guess.

           That’s all Frank needs to hear.  He stands.

                                 (announcing)
                        Alright everyone, sorry but it’s 
                        time to clear out.  My guy needs a 
                        little rest.

           No one really listens.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        LISTEN UP YOU LEECHES, IT’S TIME 
                        TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

                                 DANNY
                        Frank, let ‘em be--

                                 FRANK
                        No, Danny, I can name three people 
                        in this room and that’s about 
                        three more than you can. 
                                 (to room)
                        DID I STAMMER, I SAID GET THE FUCK 
                        OUT!

           CONTINUED: (2)

           The mumbling crowd (”Jesus,” “what the hell?” “what a 
           dick”) begins dispersing.  Once they’re gone, Danny and 
           Frank sit in silence for a moment.  Then:

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Birthday’s not till tomorrow, Kid. 
                        Got a few hours till the state 
                        mandated depression has to set in.

           Danny’s not listening.

                                 DANNY
                        You see the Golden Girls sitting 
                        in the front row?  Eating 
                        liquorice the entire time?

                                 FRANK
                        Can’t choose your fans, Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        Three of them.  Each of them older 
                        than the next.  Made one pack of 
                        liquorice last the entire show.  
                        Just sat there gumming it for two 
                        hours.  

           Frank stands.

                                 FRANK
                        Alright, enough of this crap.  
                        It’s your birthday tomorrow, 
                        that’s your big problem?  Pregnant 
                        women in Africa, feeding half 
                        their village from their 
                        titties... those ladies have 
                        problems.  Not you.

           Danny smiles weakly.

                                 DANNY
                        No, I know.  You’re right.

                                 FRANK
                        Course I’m right, I’m always 
                        right.  So go home to your 
                        mansion, pop a little blue pill, 
                        and make love to your stunning 
                        half-your age fiance who’s 
                        throwing you the massive surprise 
                        party tomorrow that I didn’t just 
                        tell you about.  Then come tell me 
                        and the sore tittied African 
                        ladies about all your problems.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Danny nods.

                                 DANNY
                        Okay.

           He stands, goes to exit.  Frank’s voice stops him.

                                 FRANK
                        It was a good show, Kid.  Really.  

           Danny turns, about to say something, then thinks better 
           of it.  He simply replies:

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah.

           INT. DANNY’S MASERATI - LATER

           It’s a preposterous car for anyone... let alone a man in 
           his sixties.  Red on the outside, leather everywhere on 
           the inside, it’s a spaceship on wheels.  

           Danny whisks in and out of traffic on Route 17... heading 
           out of New Jersey and onto:

           EXT. THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - LATER

           Where the Maserati can be spotted easily from above, 
           weaving through traffic effortlessly.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - CONTINUOUS

           We follow the car into Manhattan... Park Avenue, 
           specifically.  

           The car slows in front of the MOST LUXURIOUS BUILDING on 
           the avenue... and pulls into its UNDERGROUND PARKING.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Danny eases the car through the parking structure.  
           Across the way stands an UNDERGROUND DOORMAN, currently 
           talking on a HOUSE PHONE.  This is MARTY (30’s).  

           Marty waves Danny forward towards a small, CLOSED GARAGE 
           DOOR and holds up a finger (”Be with you in a second”).

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Danny parks, waits.  After a beat, Marty hangs up and 
           approaches.  Danny SIGHS, lowers the window.

                                 MARTY
                        Good show, Mr. Collins?

                                 DANNY
                        It was, thanks Marty.

                                 MARTY
                        Calling it early?  No after-party?

                                 DANNY
                        Little tired.  Just looking to hit 
                        the sack so...

           He motions at the garage.  Marty doesn’t take the hint.

                                 MARTY
                        What’d you open with tonight?

                                 DANNY
                        Same as always, Marty.

                                 MARTY
                        Bet they loved it.

                                 DANNY
                        They always do.
                                 (then)
                        I really gotta hit the sheets, 
                        Kid.

           He hands Marty a twenty.  Marty nods, slowly stands.  

                                 MARTY
                        Have a good night, Mr. Collins.

           Marty walks toward the garage door, hits a BUTTON.  The 
           door raises.  Danny drives inside and parks, a typical 
           single car garage.  Here’s what’s not typical:

           INSIDE THE GARAGE

           The door closes, encasing the car.  Then starts RISING.  
           This isn’t a garage, it’s an elevator.  For a car.

           And it’s taking Danny and his Maserati all the way up.

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Danny EXITS the car, ENTERS the actual apartment.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           It’s HUGE.  Modern.  Insane.  Every New Yorker’s dream.

                                 DANNY
                                 (calling out)
                        I’m home.

           No response.  Danny tosses down his keys, heads deeper 
           inside.  We stay with him... 

           DOWN A LONG HALLWAY

           PHOTOS, PLATINUM ALBUMS, MEMORABILIA line the walls.  We 
           track with Danny, never stopping long enough to fully 
           absorb anything - holy shit was that a photo with Michael 
           Jackson?  Wait, did that say 4 million copies sold? - 
           simply getting the general impression of a man who’s had 
           grand success in music for a very long time.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A bed fit for a King.  Multiple fireplaces.  Huge 
           flatscreen.  Danny calls out again.

                                 DANNY
                        Where you at?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Shower!

           Danny walks across the room, into...

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A female figure (masked by steam) showers.  The shower is 
           roughly the size of Rhode Island.

                                 SHOWERING WOMAN
                        How’d the show go?

                                 DANNY
                        It went.

                                 SHOWERING WOMAN
                        Sorry I missed it.

                                 DANNY
                        You’ve seen it before.
                                 (then)
                        What’d you do tonight?

                                 SHOWERING WOMAN
                        Just busywork around here.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DANNY
                        Always doing busywork.

                                 SHOWERING WOMAN
                        It’s a big house.  Running it 
                        keeps a girl busy.
                                 (then)
                        I’ll be out in a minute.  I’m just 
                        finishing shaving.

                                 DANNY
                        Okay. 
                                 (then, realizing)
                        Oh, Hon’?

           The door to the shower opens, revealing:

           SOPHIE (31).  She’s Danny’s fiance’.  She’s very young, 
           very hot, and very naked.

           And she’s currently shaving her pubic hair with a 
           disposable pink razor (shaving cream covers the region).  

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Sophie.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What?  

           He shakes his head, thrown by the sight, and turns to go.  
           Then he stops, remembering:

                                 DANNY
                        Oh, yeah: the kid downstairs, can 
                        you do something about him?  I 
                        don’t need a half hour of chit-
                        chat every time I pull into my 
                        garage.

                                 SOPHIE
                        He’s just trying to impress you.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, well, he’s failing.
                                 (then)
                        Okay, I’m gonna go work a little 
                        bit.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Okay, Baby.
                                 (then, realizing)
                        Wait, work on what?

                        Just... Sophie, please watch what 
                        you’re doing, you’re going to maim 
                        yourself.  
                                 (then)
                        Don’t wait up, alright?

           He EXITS the bathroom. She calls after him.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Seriously, Baby!  Work on what?

           No reply.  Sophie SHRUGS, continues her grooming.

           INT. DANNY’S HOME STUDIO - LATER

           Danny ENTERS the room, flicks on a light.  

           ON THE ROOM

           It’s a great space...  INSTRUMENTS abound, RECORDING 
           EQUIPMENT, a nice BABY GRAND PIANO in the corner.  It’s 
           obvious, however, that the room is not used often.  

           ON DANNY

           He looks around, spots what he’s looking for: a GUITAR 
           CASE in the corner, buried under paperwork.

           He picks up the case, sits down in a chair.  He wipes the 
           case clean of dust, opens it.

           INSIDE

           An OLD ACOUSTIC GUITAR.  It’s a 1960’s, vintage, Gibson.  
           Probably worth a small fortune.

           BACK TO DANNY

           Who smiles weakly.  It’s been a long time.

           Danny begins strumming. A few chords.  The beginning of 
           something simple, melodic, and gentle.

           He pauses, lowers the guitar.  Thinks for a moment. 

           He raises the guitar, but as he does he catches sight of 
           himself in the full-wall studio mirror opposite him:

           ON HIS REFLECTION

           An old man in a silly white suit, wearing platform shoes 
           and holding an ancient acoustic guitar.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           ON DANNY

           Realizing.  He stops, unwilling to go further.  You can 
           see it in his eyes,  What’s the point?

           He puts the guitar down on the ground, leans back in his 
           chair, and closes his eyes.

           He falls asleep sitting up.

           INT. CAR (INSIDE CAR ELEVATOR) - NEXT NIGHT

           Danny and Sophie ride the elevator up (inside the car). 
           Sophie holds leftovers from dinner in her lap.

           Sophie is dressed in something super revealing.  Danny 
           wears a flashy suit, with a bright pink shirt (and 
           customary wide-spread collar).  

           You can imagine the looks they got at dinner.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Good birthday dinner, Baby?

                                 DANNY
                                 (nodding)
                        Good birthday dinner.

           She kisses his cheek.  He smiles at her.

                        So how many people are inside?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Dammit! Fucking Frank!  

                                 DANNY
                        How many?

                                 SOPHIE
                        About a hundred.

           Danny SIGHS.

                                 DANNY
                        Honey: you can’t surprise a man my 
                        age. You want to give me a heart 
                        attack or something?

           She motions at her wedding ring.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Not until it’s legal.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Uch, I’m so pissed at him!

           Sophie reaches into her purse, pours a line of coke on 
           the dash, bends forward and does some.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        You want?

           Danny SIGHS.

                                 DANNY
                        You are trying to kill me.

           He accepts some, does it quickly, moves for the car door.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Sweetheart?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yeah?

                                 DANNY
                        Fix your dress.

           Her right breast is hanging out of the low-cut dress.  
           She stuffs it back in nonchalantly and EXITS the car.

           INT. PENTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           They ENTER to the apartment to a huge:

                                 CROWD
                        Surprise!

           The penthouse is full of GUESTS.  Danny feigns shock.

                                 DANNY
                        No way!  Are you kidding me!? 
                                 (to Sophie)
                        You did this?

           But Sophie’s already hopped up, barely listening, rubbing 
           her nose and sniffling.  

           Danny covers her behavior by hugging her.  The CROWD 
           AWWWWS.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 (putting on a show)
                        Don’t you all know you don’t 
                        surprise a man my age?  You could 
                        have given me a heart attack!

           Everyone LAUGHS.  Someone CUES Danny’s MOST FAMOUS SONG 
           (the one we saw him open the concert with).

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I think I know this one!

           LAUGHTER.  Danny couldn’t be more miserable, but he’s had 
           decades of experience performing.  And boy, can he 
           perform.  As WELL-WISHERS descend on Danny we launch:

           A PARTY MONTAGE

           As Danny goes through the motions in snapshots.

           - He LAUGHS with guests.

           - He DANCES slowly with an older woman.

           - He DOES COKE in the bathroom, alone.

           - He OPENS gifts, pretends to like them.

           - At one point, he spots Sophie chatting with Marty (the 
           garage doorman).  He watches as she hands him some CASH.  
           Marty takes it, walks away.  Danny approaches Sophie.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

                                 SOPHIE
                        He helped me plan things.

                                 DANNY
                        Oh.  Okay.

           She holds out her secret stash of coke.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You want?

                                 DANNY
                        No thanks.

           - Back in the bathroom.  Danny does more coke.

           - More gifts.  More dancing.  More fake laughing.  Until 
           finally...
           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LATER

           The party has pretty much cleared out.  Danny and Frank 
           (his manager, we met him before) sit on one couch.

           Opposite them, Sophie is passed out on a love seat.  
           Sprawled all over it.

           As usual, she’s hanging out everywhere.

                                 FRANK
                                 (teasing)
                        She’s like a young Jackie O’.

                                 DANNY
                        Careful.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, okay.

           Danny CHUCKLES, shakes his head. 

                                 DANNY
                        I look absurd with her.

                                 FRANK
                        Yes, you do.

           A beat.  She begins to snore, drunkenly.

                                 DANNY
                        We have to make her sign a pre-
                        nup, don’t we?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes, we do.

           Another beat.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m way too old to be putting this 
                        much shit up my nose.

                                 FRANK
                        Yes, you are.

                                 DANNY
                        Jesus, don’t give me all the good 
                        stuff at once, Frank.  You’re 
                        really earning that ten percent 
                        tonight, Pal.

           CONTINUED:

                                 FRANK
                        What do you want me to say?  No 
                        Danny, you look totally normal 
                        standing next to a coked up 
                        teenager who can’t keep her 
                        nipples covered for more than five 
                        minutes.  No, Danny, you should 
                        put more shit up your nose, I mean 
                        hell: you’re only 64!  Pre-nup?  
                        Who needs a pre-nup? I mean sure, 
                        you’ve been through three wives 
                        already, but this one really seems 
                        like the real deal.  Oh look, I 
                        can see her vagina again!

           Danny smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        Cute.

                                 FRANK
                        Thank you, I try.

           Frank STANDS.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Okay, so... I got you something.  
                        It’s pretty much the best birthday 
                        gift ever and it cost me a fortune 
                        so do me a favor and upside down 
                        the frown for five minutes, huh?

           Danny smiles, sits up.

                                 DANNY
                        Okay, okay.
                                 (boyish)
                        What’d you get me, what’d you get 
                        me?  It’s expensive?  You know how 
                        I like expensive.

           Frank smiles, bends, and picks up a wrapped GIFT.   Danny 
           grabs it, starts unwrapping.  Frank explains, excitedly:

                                 FRANK
                        I wanted to get you something good 
                        this year.  I know how fanatical 
                        you are about Lennon, so I started 
                        futzing around on the internet.  
                        Ebay, Lennon memorabilia, that 
                        kind of stuff. 

           Wrapping paper is off.  The gift is in a thin box bound 
           by a few RIBBONS.  Danny starts removing them.

                        Anyhow, I get in touch with this 
                        one guy, a collector.  I explain 
                        the situation: I’m Danny Collins’ 
                        manger, he’s a huge Lennon fan, 
                        blah blah blah.  Say I’m looking 
                        to get you something special.  He 
                        calls me back two days later, 
                        freaking out.

           Frank takes a deep breath.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit, I’ve been holding this 
                        in for three months now!  I’m 
                        bursting here!
                                 (then)
                        Danny, wait, hold on, you have to 
                        hear this first.

           Danny stops opening the gift.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You remember doing an interview, 
                        when you were a kid?  Probably one 
                        of your first.  Something called 
                        Chime Magazine? Fella named 
                        DeLoach?

           ON DANNY

           As he FLASHES BACK to our opening scene.  1967.  The tape 
           recorder.  The cigarette smoke.  Guy DeLoach.

                                 DANNY
                                 (confused)
                        Yeah.  I remember.

                                 FRANK
                        So ‘67, the interview gets 
                        published.  I don’t know what 
                        you’d said in it - something about 
                        being worried about getting rich, 
                        you mentioned Lennon, doesn’t 
                        matter.  Point is: Lennon read it! 
                        And he wrote you a letter!

           Danny lowers the box, confused.

                                 DANNY
                        What?  Frank, what the hell are 
                        you talking about?

                                 FRANK
                        John Lennon wrote you a letter, 
                        Pal!  In 1967.  He sent it to you 
                        at the magazine, care of this 
                        DeLoach guy.  DeLoach smells money 
                        - handwritten letter from John 
                        Lennon and all - so he holds onto 
                        it, never tells you.  DeLoach died 
                        five years ago, he’s not the 
                        point.  The point is he sold the 
                        letter to a collector.  The guy I 
                        called finds it, tells me.  I 
                        bought it for you.  Can you 
                        believe this shit?

                                 DANNY
                        I’m not following this, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Open the box, just open it.

           Danny does, slowly.  Frank has had the letter framed and 
           matted, beautifully.  

           ON THE LETTER

           It’s small, handwritten.  Very personalized. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        A handwritten letter to you from 
                        John Lennon, written in 1967.  Can 
                        you fucking believe it?  Read it!

           Danny is still processing.  He reads, out loud, slowly:

                                 DANNY
                        Dear Danny Collins.  Yoko and I 
                        read your interview.  Being rich 
                        and famous doesn’t change the way 
                        you think.  It doesn’t corrupt 
                        your art.  Only you can do that.  
                        So what do you think about that, 
                        Danny Collins?  Stay true to your 
                        music.  Stay true to yourself.  
                        Love your family.  It is all that 
                        matters.  My phone number is 
                        below.  Call me, we can discuss 
                        this.  We can help.  Love, John.

                        wanted to give it to you when I...

           As Frank continues rambling excitedly, we PUSH in on 
           Danny.

           ON DANNY

           He’s just staring at the letter.  Reading it, over and 
           over.  His world has clearly just rotated on its axis.

           A letter from your hero, meant to be delivered to you 
           when you were nineteen.  Warning you of all the things 
           you wound up doing and now regret.  Forty years too late.  

           Can you imagine?

           CUE SONG: Imagine, written by John Lennon.  

           Everything SLOWS as Danny looks around the room.  The 
           imagery conflicts with the beautiful song: his fiance, 
           belching and half-conscious.  The hanger-ons passed out 
           in the corner.  His preposterously lavish apartment.

           Sad, horrific, irony.

           The song carries into...

           INT. DANNY’S STUDIO - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Danny sits there, holding the letter, staring at it.   

           He’s slowly unraveling.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Danny lies in bed, awake.  He hasn’t slept.  He gets up 
           from the bed, stands.  Sophie rolls over.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Where are you going?

                                 DANNY
                        For a ride.

                                 SOPHIE
                        When will you be back?

                                 DANNY
                        Late.
           INT. DANNY’S MASERATI - LATER

           Danny drives through NYC.  All morning.  West side.  East 
           Side.  Mid-town.  Aimless.  Just thinking.  

           The whole time the letter sits next to him, on the 
           passenger seat.  Haunting him.

           Finally he winds up driving through:

           CENTRAL PARK.

           He pulls the Maserati over, stopping behind a row of 
           EMPTY HORSE CARRIAGES.  He gets out of the car.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS

           PEOPLE spot Danny, recognize him.  They whisper.  Point.  
           But Danny’s oblivious.  He just stares out at the park.

           Slowly... ever so slowly... a smile creeps over his face.   

           He cracks his neck, once each way.  Then, as before:

                                 DANNY
                        Yep.

           He gets back in the car and races off.  Full speed now.

           EXT. PARK AVENUE - CONTINUOUS

           The Maserati turns into the usual UNDERGROUND PARKING 
           AREA of Danny’s building.  But then... the car stops.  
           Slowly backs up and parks, instead, on the street.

           Danny gets out.  Enters the building from the front door.

           INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Danny strides into the regular elevator.

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           A MUSAK VERSION of Danny’s most popular song plays as he 
           rides up in silence.  He shakes it off, determined.
           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Danny ENTERS.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m home!

           We hear frantic FOOTSTEPS in the distance. 

                                 SOPHIE (O.S.)
                        Baby!?

           Danny smiles, marches toward the bedroom.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sophie lies in bed, confused and a little frazzled.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I thought you were coming back 
                        late.

                                 DANNY
                        Change of plans.

           Danny takes a SUITCASE out.  He begins filling it.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 DANNY
                        Packing.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Where are you going?

                                 DANNY
                        Away.
                                 (then)
                        Where is he?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Who?

                                 DANNY
                        Whoever you were just in bed with, 
                        where is he hiding?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Danny--

                                 DANNY
                        Honey, I didn’t pull in the 
                        garage, so the kid downstairs 
                        couldn’t call you and then stall 
                        me with idle chit-chat so you 
                        could get him out of here in time.  
                        I’m not mad, I promise, I just 
                        don’t want to open a closet and 
                        have a strange man jump out and 
                        scare the shit out of me.  He’s 
                        not in the closet is he?

                                 SOPHIE
                                 (relenting)
                        No.

                                 DANNY
                        Good.
                                 (then, loudly)
                        You can come out!  I promise I’m 
                        not mad!

                                 SOPHIE
                        Jesus.  
                                 (loudly)
                        Just come out.  It’s okay.

           A YOUNG HANDSOME MAN in TIGHTY-WHITEYS comes out from 
           under the bed.  Danny smiles, continues packing.

                                 DANNY
                                 (to the guy)
                        You must be busywork.

                        I’ll call you busywork.  She’s 
                        always doing busywork.  Now I 
                        understand.

                        Sweetie, I could not be less mad.  
                        I had fun, did you have fun?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yeah.

                        Good.  I’m glad.  You stay.  Keep 
                        the apartment for a while.  You 
                        and Busywork here.  Enjoy 
                        yourselves.  Be young, have fun, I 
                        need my address book, there’s an 
                        address I need in my address book.  
                        Ah, here it is.

           Danny leans in toward Sophie, kisses her cheek.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I would have made you sign a pre-
                        nup anyway.  You’re not missing 
                        out on any big money if that makes 
                        you feel better.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I guess it does a little.

                                  DANNY
                        I’m glad.

           Danny holds his hand out toward Judd.  They shake.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Busywork, take care of her.

                        My parents had their first dance

                                 DANNY
                        Well that’s fucked up in all kinds 
                        of ways now, isn’t it?

                        Okay, adios Kids.

           He grabs his SUITCASE and EXITS.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

           Danny EXITS the apartment, a skip in his step.  He gets 
           in the Maserati, still parked in front of the building, 
           and zooms away.

           We can hear his LAUGHTER all the way down Park Ave.

           CUE SONG: Watching the Wheels, written by John Lennon
           EXT. GARDEN STATE PARKWAY - ONE HOUR LATER

           The Maserati takes EXIT 172 on the Garden State Turnpike. 
           The EXIT SIGN READS: “Grand Ave/Last Exit in NJ.”

           EXT. WOODCLIFF LAKE HILTON - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

           The Maserati pulls up in front of this ordinary Hilton. 

           The rest of the valet area is littered with Toyotas, 
           Minivans, and Fords.

           ON A VALET KID (22)

           Standing there, bored.  He sees the Maserati approach.

                        Holy shit.

           The car pulls to a stop.  Danny steps out of the car.

           The kid runs forward.

                        Welcome to the Hilton, Danny

                        What should I call you?

           He hands Nick a HUNDRED.  Nicky masks his excitement.

           Danny is already walking away.

           INT. WOODCLIFF LAKE HILTON - CONTINUOUS

           Danny walks in.  It could be any hotel, in any city.  A 
           lobby.  A LOBBY restaurant.  A lobby BAR.  That’s it.

           A SIGN reads: “WELCOME GREATER NJ DENTAL ASSOCIATION.” 
           (Note: people who look like... well, dentists, will 
           populate the hotel throughout our stay).

                        Perfect.

           Danny walks to the front desk.  A PRETTY YOUNG GIRL (23) 
           works on the computer.

                                 DANNY
                        I do not have a reservation, but 
                        I’m hoping that won’t be a deal-
                        breaker because I am rapidly 
                        falling in love with this Hilton.

           She SIGHS, looks up.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Holy shit!

                                 DANNY
                        I get that a lot.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t--

                                 DANNY
                        No apology required.  What is your 
                        name?

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Jaime.

                                 DANNY
                        Jaime, I’m Danny.

                                 JAIME
                        I know who you are.

                                 DANNY
                        Nicky Ernst.  Ask him to take you 
                        for a ride in my car, you’ll fall 
                        in love.
                                 (then)
                        Look at you! Another fantastic 
                        young face.  What an amazing place 
                        this Woodcliff Lake Hilton is.  
                        Why are your faces so fantastic 
                        and young?

                                 JAIME
                        We’re all college kids I guess, 
                        off for summer or just graduated.

                                 DANNY
                        Ah.  That must be it.

                                 JAIME
                        How long will you be staying with 
                        us Mr. Collins?

           Danny pulls out his ADDRESS BOOK from his suit pocket.

                                 DANNY
                        Jaime, my GPS tells me that we’re 
                        not far from a Hillsdale, New 
                        Jersey.  Now tell me: is my GPS 
                        lying to me or giving me the 
                        straight shit?

                                 JAIME
                                 (smiling)
                        Straight shit.  You’re five 
                        minutes.

                                 DANNY
                        Well, then I will be staying 
                        indefinitely.

           Jamie smiles, a little confused.

                                 JAIME
                        Okay.  I’ll give you the Honeymoon 
                        suite, it’s our nicest room... 
                        only I don’t know how to do an 
                        indefinite reservation.

                                 DANNY
                        Don’t need a honeymoon suite.  
                        Just a regular, everyday room.

                                 JAIME
                        Okay but I still don’t know how...

           Jaime turns toward the back, yells out.

                                 JAIME (CONT’D)
                                 (calling out)
                        Mary?

                                 DANNY
                        If someone else with a wonderful 
                        face comes out I don’t know if 
                        I’ll be able to handle it.

           MARY SINCLAIR (50’s) emerges from the BACK OFFICE.  She’s 
           beautiful, great smile... an age appropriate beauty.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I officially can’t handle 
                        it.

           Jamie darts over towards Mary, WHISPERS loudly.

                                 JAIME
                        Look who it is!

                                 MARY
                                 (calmly)
                        I see.  

                                 JAIME
                                 (rapid-fire whisper)
                        He wants to stay indefinitely and 
                        I don’t know how to do that.  I 
                        was going to give him the 
                        honeymoon suite but--

                                 DANNY
                                 (loudly)
                        He didn’t want the Honeymoon 
                        Suite.

           Mary and Jaime turn toward him, synchronized.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not my Honeymoon and I’m not 
                        very sweet.  Regular room will do 
                        just fine.

           involved.

                        And what college do you go to 
                        young lady?

                                 MARY
                        Ha.

                        Ha.

           A beat.

                                 MARY
                        You’re staying indefinitely?

                        Huge fan of this Hilton.

                        you to dinner?

                                 MARY
                        You’re asking me to dinner?

           can’t help but smile, just a little.

           INT. DANNY’S HOTEL ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Danny stands in the center of the room, taking it in.

           ON THE ROOM

           It could be any hotel room in the world.  A bed, a small 
           desk, and a two seat couch.  That’s it.

           BACK TO DANNY

           He may as well be taking in the Sistine Chapel.  He walks 
           over to the ratty loveseat, rests his guitar against it.

           He digs into his bag, and pulls out the framed LENNON 
           LETTER.  Sets it up on his nightstand.

           He steps back, takes it all in. Then, once more:

                                 DANNY
                        Perfect.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Around the bar, we see PATRONS talking, whispering, 
           pointing.  They all seem distracted by something on the 
           other side of the room.

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

           Danny sits at the bar.  He’s wearing a customary over-the-
           top suit and has his GUITAR CASE standing against the 
           stool next to him.  He’s drinking scotch.

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        Danny?

           Danny turns.  Frank stands there.

                                 DANNY
                        Frank!

           Danny stands, envelopes Frank in a surprising BEAR HUG.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Sit, sit.  Thanks for coming.  
                        Have you been here before?

                                 FRANK
                        The bar at the Woodcliff Lake 
                        Hilton?
                                 (then, obviously)
                        No.

           Frank sits.  He’s obviously concerned.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I called the house.  Spoke to 
                        Sophie.  She said you--

                                 DANNY
                        I did.

                        So you--

                                 DANNY
                        Yes.
                                 (then, calling out)
                        Barkeep?  An ice water for this 
                        handsome young man, por favor?

           Frank notices the GUITAR next to Danny.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re carrying your guitar around 
                        I see?  To hotel bars.

                                 DANNY
                        Trying to get used to the feel of 
                        it.  I might start writing again.

                                 FRANK
                        Well that’s great, Pal.

           Danny turns toward Frank, serious.

                                 DANNY
                        Frank, I’ve decided to make some 
                        big changes in my life.  Some of 
                        them may come as a bit of a shock, 
                        some of them may even affect you 
                        financially.

           Frank puts his hand on Danny’s knee.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 FRANK
                        I’m here as your friend, Danny.  
                        Not as your manager.

                                 DANNY
                        Actually, I need you to be here as 
                        my manager for a moment.

           Danny takes a sip of scotch.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I need you to cancel tomorrow 
                        night’s show.

           Frank doesn’t hesitate.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay.  It won’t be easy, but okay.

                                 DANNY
                        Good.  Cause then I need you to 
                        cancel the rest of my tour.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry?

                                 DANNY
                        Don’t be sorry, I’m not sorry.  
                        I’m done, Frank. 
                                 (then)
                        Oh, I’ll also need you to call 
                        Ken, tell him to sell all my 
                        stock, all the houses, put 
                        everything into savings accounts, 
                        or CDS, whatever’s safest.  I want 
                        no debt, no expenses, no risk. So 
                        help me God I will never be forced 
                        to sing those songs again.  Oh, 
                        wait, tell Ken not to sell the 
                        penthouse yet.  I’m going to let 
                        Sophie and the kid she was 
                        cheating on me with stay there for 
                        a while--

                                 FRANK
                        Danny, stop!

           Danny stops.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You’re spiraling.  Are you on 
                        something?  What did you take?

           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 DANNY
                        Nothing, I promise.  Actually, I’m 
                        done with that shit too.  No more 
                        drinking, no more smoking, no more 
                        drugs.  I’m done.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re drinking right now, Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        True.  Okay, forget what I said 
                        about the drinking. I mean, I’m 
                        making a life change, not becoming 
                        a priest, right?

                                 FRANK
                        This is because of Sophie?

                                 DANNY
                        Sophie?  No!  Jesus, Frank, give 
                        me a little credit.
                                 (then)
                        It’s because of the letter.

           Danny puts down his drink.  Changes tone.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        What if I had gotten it when I was 
                        supposed to, Frank?  What if I had 
                        gotten it when I was a sweet 
                        nineteen year old kid who didn’t 
                        know jack shit about anything?

                                 FRANK
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DANNY
                        He was my hero.  I would have 
                        called him.  I would have spent 
                        six days dialing the phone and 
                        hanging up but I would have called 
                        eventually.  
                                 (then)
                        Maybe my life would have turned 
                        out different.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re too hard on yourself, Kid. 
                        Always have been.

                                 DANNY
                        I was a songwriter, Frank.  That’s 
                        all I was.  Simple songs.

                        Just me and my guitar.  You’ve 
                        heard my first album.

                                 FRANK
                        Yes, I’m the only one.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, so I sold out.  For money.  
                        For fame.  I did it all wrong.  
                        Just look at the letter.  “Stay 
                        true to your music.”

           Danny makes a BZZZZZZ sound like an “incorrect” game show 
           buzzer.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        “Stay true to yourself.”

           “BZZZZZ!”

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        “Love your family?”  I have three 
                        failed marriages and a grown son 
                        I’ve never spoken to.

           “BZZZZZ!”  Frank leans forward, concerned.  Gently:

                                 FRANK
                        You’re having a break down Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        Hate to tell you, Buddy, but I’ve 
                        been breaking down for forty 
                        years. I’m broken. Ain’t nothing 
                        left to break.
                                 (beat, then)
                        I’m sixty-four, Frank. I’ve been 
                        abusing my body for the better 
                        parts of four decades.  If I’m 
                        gonna find any kind of redemption, 
                        I can’t waste any more time.

           He taps his guitar.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna write some real songs.  
                        People will probably hate them, 
                        but so what?  And I’m gonna go see 
                        my kid.  He’ll probably hate me, 
                        but I’m gonna try that, too.

                                 FRANK
                        You know where he is?

                        Had a guy track him down two years 
                        ago.  Lives in Hillsdale, New 
                        Jersey.

                                 FRANK
                        Where’s that?

                                 DANNY
                        Five minutes from here.

                        Jesus.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah.

           A beat, then:

                                 FRANK
                        You make this move, it’ll be hard 
                        to turn back, Danny.  A sixty-
                        something man starts cancelling 
                        tours, disappointing fans, people 
                        start wondering.  I’m talking to 
                        you as your manager.

                                 DANNY
                        Actually, I need you to be my 
                        friend again now.

           Frank nods, sits there for a beat, then:

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll cancel the tour.

           Danny nods back, clinks his scotch against Frank’s water. 
           They turn back toward the bar in unison.  

           After a beat, from behind, Frank puts his hand on Danny’s 
           shoulder.  There’s nothing left to say.

           INT. WOODCLIFF LAKE HILTON LOBBY - NEXT MORNING

           Danny walks through the lobby, a spring in his step.  His 
           outfit/suit is typically bold.  

           He stops at the front desk.  Jamie and Mary are there.

                                 DANNY

                        making passes, we’ll see who gives 
                        up first, sound good?

                        Going to meet my son.  How do I 
                        look?

                                 MARY
                        Honestly?

                                 DANNY
                        If this relationship is going to 
                        go the distance Mary, I think we 
                        should always be honest with one 
                        another.

                                 MARY
                        You look ridiculous.

                        Nah, I look sharp.  See you at 
                        seven.

                                 MARY
                        No you won’t.

           Danny steps outside, Nicky waits with his car.

           scattered around the lawn. It could not be more ordinary.

           And up to this house pulls a gleaming, red, Maserati.  
           Driven by...

           Danny Collins.  National superstar.  Wearing, what can 
           best be described, as a zoot suit.

           He emerges from the car, carrying a large BROWN BAG.  
           Danny takes a deep breath, cracks his neck each way.

                                 DANNY
                        Yep.

           He approaches the front door.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Danny RINGS the bell, shuffles nervously. Footsteps from 
           inside.  Danny braces himself. The door OPENS, revealing:

           Nobody.

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello.

           Danny looks downward at:

           A LITTLE GIRL (6).  This is HOPE, Danny’s granddaughter.  
           Needless to say, Hope is pretty fucking cute.

                                 DANNY
                        Hello.

                                 HOPE
                        I am Hope.

                                 DANNY
                        I am Danny.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hope, you are not to open that 
                        door for strangers!

                                 HOPE
                        He’s not a stranger!  We saw him 
                        on TV.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        What?

           Hope’s mother arrives. This is SAMANTHA (late 30’s).  
           Samantha is pretty and pregnant.  She’s a study in 
           contrasts: tough but emotional, sexy but a little 
           tomboyish, and - at the moment - calm but completely 
           thrown by the sight of Danny Collins on her front 
           doorstep.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Whoa.

                                 HOPE
                        Told you.

                                 SAMANTHA
                                 (strongly)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 HOPE
                                 (imitating her 
                                 mother)
                        YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?

                                 DANNY
                        Hi, I’m Danny.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SAMANTHA
                        We know who you are.

                                 HOPE
                                 (still imitating, 
                                 yelling)
                        YEAH!  WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE!

           Hope WHEEZES.  Samantha immediately turns her attention 
           to her daughter.  She rubs Hope’s back, calming her.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Settle, Baby.  Calm down.  Deep 
                        breath.  

           Hope takes a deep breath.  Samantha waits for her.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Okay?

                                 HOPE
                                 (nodding)
                        Okay.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Small voices for a minute, right?

                                 HOPE
                                 (nodding, whispering)
                        Small voices.

           Samantha and Hope look back up at Danny.

                                 HOPE (CONT’D)
                                 (still whispering, 
                                 admitting)
                        I don’t really know who you are.

           Danny bends down, takes in Hope for the first time.  His 
           granddaughter.  Wow.  He touches her face, gentle.

           Up above them, Samantha doesn’t move, unsure what to do.  

           Danny stands back up, offers forth his BROWN BAG.

                                 DANNY
                        I was unsure of what was 
                        appropriate to bring...  

                                 SAMANTHA
                                 (ignoring)
                        He’s at work.

           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 DANNY
                        So I brought bagels.

           Samantha thinks.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Wow.  Okay.  This is weird.  I 
                        guess...
                                 (then)
                        Come in?

                                 DANNY
                        Okay.

           Danny follows them into the house.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           They walk into the small kitchen.  There are no granite 
           tops here.  No fancy espresso machines.  It’s warm, but 
           small.  Hand-drawn pictures on the fridge.

           Danny puts the bagels on the table.

                                 HOPE
                                 (still whispering)
                        I want a bagel, can I have a bagel 
                        Mommy?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Regular voices now, okay Baby?  
                        But still calm?

                                 HOPE
                        Okay.

           Samantha sits Hope down at the table with Danny.  She 
           goes into cabinets, getting out plates, knives, creme 
           cheese, etc.  As she works...

                                 DANNY
                        Can I do anything?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’ve got it.

           She starts creme-cheesing a bagel for Hope.  She looks at 
           Danny, shakes her head.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Wow.  I mean... wow on so many 
                        levels.

           Samantha realizes what she’s doing.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Sorry, Baby.

                        How far along are you?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Six months.

                        A boy.  Wow.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        On so many levels.

           She stands.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        I have to call him.

                                 DANNY
                        Of course.

           She walks to the other side of the kitchen, dials the 
           phone, keeping an eye the whole time on Danny and Hope.

                                 SAMANTHA
                                 (into phone)
                        Amy, it’s Samantha. Is he in?  
                        Thanks.

           Danny turns to his granddaughter.

                                 DANNY
                        So... Hope, what grade are you in?

                                 HOPE
                        I just finished the first grade.  
                        My teacher is named Mrs. Williams 
                        and my best friend is named Abby.  
                        Why are you on TV?

                        Because I’m a singer.

                                 HOPE
                        Are you a good singer?

                                 DANNY
                        No, not really.

                                 HOPE
                        I didn’t think so.

                        It’s okay.  
                                 (back to Hope)
                        Why didn’t you think so?

                                 HOPE
                        Because when you were on the TV, 
                        Daddy said “Shut if off, 
                        Samantha,” and Mommy turned it off 
                        really fast, and then Mommy said, 
                        “Tom?” and Daddy said, “No” and 
                        that was that.

           Samantha starts to say something, but then starts talking 
           into the phone (he’s gotten on the line).  Danny watches.

                                 SAMANTHA
                                 (into phone)
                        Hey, so... your fa... Danny 
                        Collins just showed up at the 
                        house.
                                 (long beat)
                        Uh huh.  I know. Having bagels in 
                        the kitchen with Hope.
                                 (a beat)
                        What was I supposed...
                                 (a beat)
                        Yes.  Okay.

           She hangs up, puts on a big fake smile, and announces:

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        He’s coming home.

                                 HOPE
                        Yay!

           Danny looks at Samantha.  She SHRUGS.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Hope is watching television, completely absorbed.

           Danny and Samantha sit awkwardly on the couch behind her, 
           watching her watch the television.

                                 DANNY
                        So how long have you two been 
                        together?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Married twelve, together fifteen.  
                        We met in college.

                                 DANNY
                        Rutgers, right?

                                 (confused)
                        Uh-huh, that’s right.

           A beat, then:

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        I have so many questions.

                                 DANNY
                        Ask away.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I can’t think of any of them now.

           Hope SCREAMS excitedly at something on the TV.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Hope?  Calm, okay?

           Samantha watches Hope for a beat, monitoring.

                                 DANNY
                        Is it asthma?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah.  It’s pretty severe, we 
                        almost lost her once.  And she’s 
                        diagnosed hyperactive which 
                        doesn’t make managing it any 
                        easier... why are you here?

           The way the question is delivered catches Danny by 
           surprise.

                        It’s a little late for that, isn’t 
                        it?

                                 DANNY
                        Maybe.  I hope not.

           Samantha leans back, thinks for a moment.  Then:

                                 SAMANTHA
                        My husband is the best man I’ve 
                        ever met.  Solid.  Kind.  Funny.  
                        We’ve had one fight.  Fifteen 
                        years, we’ve had one serious 
                        fight.  Two years ago, I got 
                        tickets and backstage passes to 
                        one of your shows, thought it was 
                        time he should, I don’t know... I 
                        thought he should at least meet 
                        you.  
                                 (then)
                        He disagreed.  He disagreed 
                        strongly.

           Danny nods.

                                 DANNY
                        So this isn’t going to be pretty?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        No.  I wouldn’t imagine it will 
                        be.

                                 DANNY
                        Well, if you could help grease the 
                        wheels at all... I swear I am here 
                        with only the best intentions.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Mr. Collins, my parents are dead.  
                        His mom is too.  I’d like my 
                        daughter to know her one remaining 
                        grandparent, I would.  I’d like my 
                        husband to know his father.  And 
                        I’ll admit to being a little star-
                        struck by you.  But in a minute, 
                        my husband is going to walk 
                        through that door.  And when he 
                        does, I’m confident that this will 
                        be the last time I ever see you.

                        despite what I want for my 
                        daughter, and my husband, I will 
                        not try and stop that.  You did 
                        this to yourself.  Shame on you.

           Danny NODS, understanding.

                                 DANNY
                        That was good.

                                 SAMANTHA
                                 (emotional)
                        I’ve been practicing it in my head 
                        since you gave me the bagels.

           Danny smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        He married well.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah, I’m pretty great.  You see?  
                        You really missed out.

           And just then: the FRONT DOOR opens.  There stands TOM 
           (40’s).  Handsome.  A serious man in a serious suit.  

           From the moment he ENTERS he doesn’t take his eyes off of 
           Danny.

                                 HOPE
                        Daddy!  Daddy!

           Hope runs to him.  Tom’s eyes remain on Danny as he hugs 
           her.

                                 TOM
                        Easy Baby, nice and calm, okay?  
                        Nice and calm.
                                 (to Samantha)

                        Could I speak to you outside for a 
                        second?

                                 DANNY
                        Of course.

           Danny stands, offers his hand to Samantha.

                                 (smiling)
                        Okay.

           Tom guides his daughter towards Danny.

                                 TOM
                        Hope, say goodbye to Mr. Collins.

                                 HOPE
                        Goodbye to Mr. Collins.

                        Mr. Collins, say goodbye to Hope.

           Danny kneels down, takes a knowing last look at his 
           granddaughter.

                                 DANNY
                                 (sad smile)
                        Goodbye to Hope.

           He stands, follows Tom out the door.

           EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Tom closes the door behind them.  They stare at each 
           other for a long beat.  A really long beat.  Finally:

                                 DANNY
                        You’re so tall.

                                 TOM
                                 (calmly)
                        I’m sorry.  What exactly do you 
                        want?

                                 DANNY
                        I just--

                                 TOM
                        Are you sick?  Is that why you’re 
                        here?  Are you dying?

                        No.  I’m not sick.

           Danny takes a deep breath, contemplating.  Then:

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        You have every right to be angry--

                                 TOM
                        I’m not angry, I’m really not.  
                        I’m a little confused. And I’m 
                        extremely not interested in 
                        anything you have to say.  So if 
                        you have anything to ask me, go 
                        ahead, because this will be the 
                        last time we see each other.

                                 TOM
                        I work for a bottling company in 
                        Paramus, New Jersey called Rierson 
                        Bottling.  Upper level management.  
                        Not my dream job but it’s steady 
                        and there’s decent benefits and a 
                        short commute both of which were 
                        necessary considering Hope’s 
                        medical issues. I make $84,000 
                        dollars a year which isn’t as much 
                        as it seems but we do what we can.  
                        What else?

                        you except to say it was a wild 
                        thing she did one time when she 
                        was twenty-three and got drunk 
                        backstage after a concert. I use 
                        her last name.  Anything else?

                        Ripped them up.  Don’t want your

                        have a good life.

           Tom heads back inside.  One last question stops him.

           Tom turns around.  He smiles, finally slows down a 
           little.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t love my job.  And I’m not 
                        crazy about New Jersey.  But I 
                        have the best wife in the history 
                        of wives.  An amazing little girl.  
                        I wish she wasn’t so sick.  I’d do 
                        anything for that.  But yes.  If 
                        it makes you sleep better, I’m 
                        happy.  Oh, and fuck you, you 
                        selfish prick. I am angry.

           Tom ENTERS the house, slams the door behind him.

           Danny stands there for a moment, then trudges back to his 
           car.

           Danny walks in, passing Jaime at the counter.

           Jamie is about to respond, but Danny doesn’t wait for a 
           reply.  He just keeps walking.  

           Mary is walking towards him in the other direction.  She 
           smiles when she sees him...

           But he simply nods at her and keeps walking.  Mary 
           watches him go, surprised.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER

           Danny drinks by himself in the corner.  He’s been here a

                        time I would have said yes and you 
                        never would have known because you

                        No.

                                 DANNY
                        Well now I know.

           Danny returns to his drink.  

                                 MARY
                        Okay, well, it’s 7:30 and I’m done 
                        for the day so... goodnight.

           Mary walks away.  Danny’s voice stops her.

                                 DANNY
                        I had a bad day.

           She turns around, looks at him, and admits:

                                 MARY
                        I did, too.

           A beat.  A long one.

                                 DANNY
                        Can I buy you a drink?  Not 
                        dinner, God forbid.  Just a drink.

           Mary thinks about this.

                                 MARY
                        Yes.  Okay.

           Danny looks up, surprised.  Mary sits.

                                 DANNY
                        Wow.  Okay.  What can I get you?

                                 MARY
                        Tequila, rocks, something anejo.  
                        Splash of soda.

                                 DANNY
                                 (shocked)
                        Jesus.

                                 MARY
                        You’re not the only rock star in 
                        this hotel.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 DANNY
                        Apparently not.
                                 (calling to 
                                 bartender)
                        Tommy, get me some of that patron 
                        anejo, rocks, splash of soda.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Right away, Boss.

           Danny turns back towards Mary.  

                                 MARY
                        So?  Why so sad?

                                 DANNY
                        No, I need a break from myself.  
                        You go first. Why’d you have a bad 
                        day?

                                 MARY
                        Oh, because I work with a bunch of 
                        well-meaning but remarkably dim 
                        twenty-somethings who are just 
                        passing time until they go back to 
                        school or get a real job.  And one 
                        of them screwed up the computer 
                        system and it took me half the day 
                        to reprogram every reservation 
                        manually.

           Her drink is delivered, she takes a sip.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        And you?  C’mon, spit it out, 
                        why’d you have a bad day?

           Danny takes a sip, bracing himself.  Then:

                                 DANNY
                        I tracked down my grown son who 
                        I’d never met before.  Met him, 
                        his wife, my granddaughter.  Then 
                        he told me, quite emphatically, to 
                        fuck off and die.

           She processes this, then:

                                 MARY
                        EVERY reservation, each one had to 
                        be reprogrammed manually.  I hope 
                        I made that clear.

           Danny LAUGHS.  Mary leans forward, serious.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you a question?

                                 DANNY
                        Not if it’s about why I’ve never 
                        met my son until today.

                                 MARY
                        Shit.  That was my question.

           They sit there in silence for a long beat, then:

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, can I ask you a different 
                        question?

                                 DANNY
                        Sure.

                                 MARY
                        Why is Danny Collins staying at 
                        the Woodcliff Lake Hilton, asking 
                        out a regular old woman like me 
                        and offering twenty-one year old 
                        valets the use of his sportscar?

                                 DANNY
                        You’re not a regular old woman.

                                 MARY
                        You’re not answering my question.

                                 DANNY
                        It’s a long story.

                                 MARY
                        Thank God it’s only 7:45.

           Danny looks up at the bartender.

                                 DANNY
                        Tommy?  Another round please.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER

           We pick them up, many minutes (and many drinks) later:

                                 DANNY
                        ... and then he writes, “What do 
                        you think about that Danny 
                        Collins?”

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 (repeating, laughing)
                        John Lennon writes “what do you 
                        think about that, Danny Collins!?”

                                 DANNY
                        Yes.  
                                 (as if answering)
                        I don’t know, John.  What do I 
                        think about that?  I think you 
                        should have sent the letter to my 
                        house so I could have avoided 
                        living a completely bullshit life 
                        for the past forty years, that’s 
                        what I think about that.

           Mary explodes in laughter.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER THAT NIGHT

           As Mary reveals herself a little:

                                 MARY
                        She’s twenty-five now.  Rick and I 
                        split when she was... sixteen.  
                        Yeah, most parents try to wait 
                        till the kids are out of the 
                        house, but we tried to do it at 
                        the time when it would screw her 
                        up most.

                                 DANNY
                        Did it work?

                                 MARY
                        Oh, yeah.  She’s a complete mess.  
                        Hates both of us.  But guess what?

                                 DANNY
                        What?

           Mary leans in, whispers conspiratorially:

                                 MARY
                        She hates him more.

                                 DANNY
                        Perfect!

           Mary suddenly becomes emotional and vulnerable:

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARY
                        Okay I don’t like joking about 
                        this anymore.  I’m a good mother, 
                        I swear.

                                 DANNY
                                 (whoa)
                        No, I know.

                                 MARY
                                 (adorable)
                        I was just trying to be funny.

                                 DANNY
                        I know!

                                 MARY
                                 (completely gone)
                        We did split up when she was 
                        sixteen but I don’t think she 
                        hates me.  Oh, maybe she does.     
                        I don’t want any more tequila!

           She’s crying now, but also laughing.  It’s incredibly 
           appealing.  And Danny’s obviously falling for her. Hard.

           LATER THAT NIGHT

                                 DANNY
                        My second wife was actually one of 
                        the stars of Gilligan’s Island.

                                 MARY
                        I didn’t know that! Who?

                                 DANNY
                        Guess.

           Beat, then:

                                 MARY
                        Ginger?

           He shakes his head “no.”  Suddenly, Mary gets it.  
           SCREAMS!

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Mary Ann!

           He smiles.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit!  You were married to 
                        Mary Ann!?  That’s insane!

           CONTINUED: (2)

           AND LATER THAT NIGHT:

                        And so that’s it, just no more 
                        touring?

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah.  I mean, at least with the 
                        old stuff.  But I don’t know... I 
                        started writing again.  I actually 
                        wrote something last night.

                                 MARY
                        Really?

           Danny NODS, then:

                                 DANNY
                        You want to hear it?

           INT. DANNY’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Danny pulls his GUITAR out of its case.  Mary, meanwhile, 
           is looking at the LETTER FROM LENNON.

                                 MARY
                                 (re: letter)
                        This is truly unreal.

           She shakes her head, puts the letter down.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You better have something to play 
                        me.  Because if this was just a 
                        lame attempt to get me to your 
                        room--

                                 DANNY
                        I have something to play you.

           Danny sits, settles.  He’s nervous.  He fiddles with the 
           guitar.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, so, I haven’t written 
                        anything in a very long time. And 
                        I haven’t written anything like 
                        this... since I was in my 
                        twenties.

                                 MARY
                        Okay, okay.  Enough stalling, 
                        Collins.  Let’s hear it.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DANNY
                        Okay.

           Danny cracks his neck, then:

           He starts playing.  He’s playing the same MELODY he 
           started back in the fancy studio of his penthouse, long 
           before he’d received Lennon’s letter.  

           But now it has words.  

           Danny starts to sing... the music is simple, the melody 
           and lyrics wrenching.  It’s Dylan, it’s Cash, and these 
           will NOT be the final lyrics.

                        I woke up just this morning/Didn’t 
                        know where I’d been/But there’s 
                        far bigger things/That

           Danny stops, looks up.

                                 MARY
                        Keep going, keep going!

                                 DANNY
                        That’s as far as I got.

           Mary looks confused.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Honestly, this kind of was just a 
                        lame attempt to get you to my 
                        room.

                                 MARY
                        Jesus Christ.

           Mary shakes her head, stands.

                                 DANNY
                        Come on!  Stay!  I’m an old man 
                        with ten scotches in him.  The 
                        odds of anything risque happening 
                        here are very, very slim.

                                 MARY
                                 (with a smile)
                        Goodnight, Danny.

                                 (giving up)
                        Goodnight, Mary.

           She stops at the door.

                                 MARY
                        It’s going to be a good song.

                                 DANNY
                        You think?  Cause it’s pretty 
                        different from what I’m known--

                                 MARY
                        It’s beautiful, Danny.  A little 
                        short, but it’s going to be 
                        beautiful.

                                 DANNY
                        Thank you.

           She EXITS the room, stops in the HALLWAY. 

                                 MARY
                        And hey, about what we talked 
                        about? You shouldn’t give up.

                                 DANNY
                        I agree.  
                                 (then, immediately)
                        Mary, will you have dinner with me 
                        tomorrow?

                                 MARY
                        Not that.  Your son.  

           Danny smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        I know.

                                 MARY
                        Okay.
                                 (then)
                        But don’t give up on dinner 
                        either.

                                 DANNY
                                 (immediately)
                        Mary, will you have dinner with--

           But the door closes before he can finish.  

           ON DANNY

           Completely smitten... and maybe even a little inspired.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           EXT. WOODCLIFF LAKE HILTON BUSINESS CENTER - NEXT MORNING

           Outside, HOTEL GUESTS (and a lot of DENTISTS) are crammed 
           around the GLASS DOOR, looking inside...

           INT. WOODCLIFF LAKE HILTON BUSINESS CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           Where national icon Danny Collins sits at a COMPUTER 
           wearing only a HOTEL ROBE and SLIPPERS.  He has PAPERS 
           scattered around him, everywhere.

           - He takes notes.

           - He sends faxes.

           - He makes calls.

           - In between he behaves as if he’s Eloise at the Plaza: 
           ROOM SERVICE BREAKFAST is brought in for him.  A 
           NEWSPAPER delivered.  COFFEE refills served.

           - We hear and see bits and pieces of everything: Danny 
           explaining who he is over the phone.  Danny giving a 
           credit card number.  Danny asking how quickly whatever 
           he’s planning can happen.

           OUTSIDE THE BUSINESS CENTER

           Mary pushes through the spectators to see what’s going 
           on.  She sees Danny pacing around inside, a man 
           possessed.  

           She smiles, doesn’t interrupt.

           BACK INSIDE

           We watch as Danny makes one final call:

                                 DANNY
                                 (into phone)
                        Hey, Frank.  It’s me.  Listen, I 
                        need you to make some calls.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Frank sits at a desk with another MAN IN A SUIT.

                                 FRANK
                                 (into phone)
                        Hey Pal, good timing.

                        Look, Ken’s here. We need to go 
                        over some stuff with you as soon 
                        as possib--

           Frank stops talking, starts listening.  Danny has cut him 
           off.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                                 (listening)
                        Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Danny, slow 
                        down.  Okay, listen: this is 
                        exactly what we need to talk to 
                        you about.

           Frank listens, SIGHS, relents.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold on.

           Frank grabs a PAD and a PEN.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead.  Uh huh, uh huh...

           As Frank writes he covers up the receiver for a moment, 
           looks at Ken, and WHISPERS:

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Not good.

           Ken shakes his head.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. TOM AND SAMANTHA’S HOUSE - NEXT DAY

           A quiet morning in the neighborhood.

           A SUBURBAN DAD waters his lawn next door.

           A STRETCH LIMOSINE (gigantic) pulls up to the curb, 
           catching the dad’s attention.  Out steps Danny Collins, 
           wearing a white suit, pastel yellow shirt, black shoes.

                                 SUBURBAN DAD
                        Holy shit.

           Danny walks towards his son’s front door.  As he passes, 
           he NODS to the neighbor.

                                 DANNY
                        Mornin’.

                        Hi.

           Danny RINGS the bell.  The door opens.  It Samantha:

                                 SAMANTHA
                                 (re: Danny)
                        Oh fuck me.

                                 DANNY
                        Language, Dear.

           Hope runs to the door, sees Danny

                                 HOPE
                        WE DON’T WANT YOUR MUSIC!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hope, easy.  Calm.

           Danny bends down, confused.

                                 DANNY
                        You don’t want my music?

           Samantha explains, pointedly:

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Tom explained to Hope the other 
                        day how you’re a musician and how 
                        some musicians go door to door to 
                        sell their music.

                                 DANNY
                        Ohhh.  Okay.

                                 SAMANTHA
                                 (still explaining)
                        But we weren’t interested in 
                        buying any music.  Much the same 
                        way some people aren’t interested 
                        in buying girl scout cookies.  
                        Doesn’t mean we’re rude, just that 
                        we weren’t interested in buying 
                        any music.

                                 DANNY
                        No, I get it.  Possibly more 
                        complicated an explanation than 
                        required for a six year old, but 
                        okay.

           Hope spots the limo.

           Hope runs for it.

                        Hope!

                                 (calling out)
                        Jimmy.

           A LIMO DRIVER (Jimmy) gets out.  He opens a door for 
           Hope, lets her in.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        She’s fine, let her play. He’s got 
                        her.  

           Tom arrives at the door, sees Danny.

                        Are you fucking kidding me?

                                 DANNY
                        Oh good, we’re all here.

                        Have you heard of Texas Children’s 
                        Hospital in Houston?

           Tom stops.

                                 TOM
                        What?

                                 DANNY
                        There’s a doctor, Dr. Ryan Kurtz, 
                        he’s considered the most 
                        progressive guy in pediatric 
                        pulmonology.  Turns out his 
                        parents are fans of mine.  Really 
                        big fans actually.  He’ll see 
                        Hope.  He’ll see her this weekend.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sorry, what?

                        Are you out of your mind?  Do you 
                        honestly think that we haven’t 
                        seen every doctor, tried 
                        everything imaginable that might

                        over a year to see him.  He’s 
                        willing to see you this weekend.

           Samantha looks at Tom.  Tom says nothing.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Just give me one weekend to do 
                        something good for you.  You’ll 
                        still go to Heaven cause you’re so 
                        damn tolerant, and I’ll still go 
                        to Hell because you can’t buy 
                        redemption.  Everyone wins.

           Tom looks at Samantha.  She clearly wants this.  He 
           shakes his head, still holding onto his fury.

                                 TOM
                        So we’d have to go to Houston is 
                        that it?

                                 DANNY
                        I’ve made arrangements.  We’ll 
                        take my plane.

                                 TOM
                        I’m not putting my family on some 
                        dangerous four seater plane.

           Danny smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        Me neither.

           EXT. TEETERBORO AIRPORT, NJ - HOURS LATER.

           The biggest goddamn PRIVATE JET you’ve ever seen.  We pan 
           Danny’s family, taking it in.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Holy shit.

           Hope GIGGLES.

                                 HOPE
                        Mommy said shit.

                                 (nodding)
                        Yes she did, Baby.  Yes she did.

           CUE SONG: Ticket to Ride, written by John Lennon.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER

           We’re mid-flight.  Tom, Samantha, and Hope sit on one 
           side of the plane.

           Hope is in Tom’s lap, pressed against the window, 
           pointing things out in the sky.

                                 HOPE
                        Is this where God lives?

                        Oh no, Baby.  God lives much 
                        higher than this.  Much better 
                        view...

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANE

           Sits Danny, watching.  Tom is patient with Hope: 
           explaining things, making her laugh, involving Samantha 
           in the laughter, too.

           Is there anything better than watching someone who’s 
           great with a child?

           Yes, actually, there is: watching your child be great 
           with his child.

           EXT. TEXAS CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - LATER

           It’s a massive complex, located in the heart of Houston.

           INT. TEXAS CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           The family sits in the empty waiting room.  Hope is 
           CHATTERING away but there’s clear tension between the 
           adults.

           A YOUNG DOCTOR in street clothes (40’s) ENTERS.  This is 
           DR. RYAN KURTZ.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Sorry to keep you waiting.  And 
                        sorry for the jeans - I refuse to 
                        wear a lab coat on the weekend.  
                        I’m Dr. Kurtz and holy cow, you’re 
                        Danny Collins!  

           Danny smiles, shakes Kurtz’s hand.

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        Wow, seeing you in person is way 
                        different than talking to you on 
                        the phone.

                                 DANNY
                        Good to meet you, Doc.

           He turns to Tom.

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        And you must be Hope.

                        Tom.

           Kurtz feigns confusion, turns toward Samantha.

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        Then... you must be Hope.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Samantha.

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        Then who’s Hope?

           Hope, of course, finds this routine hysterical.

                                 HOPE
                        I’M HOPE!  I’M HOPE!

           She WHEEZES. Samantha pats her back.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Easy, Baby.

           Kurtz smiles, kneels down.

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        I should have known.
                                 (then)
                        Hope, would you like to leave this 
                        boring room and come do some fun 
                        breathing games with me?  I have 
                        lollypops, and I’m not talking 
                        junky Doctor lollypops, I’m 
                        talking cavity inducing lollypops 
                        with chewy goo in the middle.

                                 HOPE
                        Yeah!

           Dr. Kurtz turns toward Tom and Samantha.

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        I’ve looked at her charts, but I’m 
                        gonna need a few hours with her, 
                        okay?

           They NOD.  Kurtz turns toward Danny.

                                 DR. KURTZ (CONT’D)
                        Is it okay if I... you know...

                        Of course.

           Dr. Kurtz smiles, calls out:

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        Mom?  Dad!?

           Into the rooms steps MR. and MRS. KURTZ (70’s).  They see 
           Danny and immediately freak out.

                                 MRS. KURTZ
                        Oh my God.

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        Mr. Collins, these are my parents, 
                        Arny and Anne Kurtz.  They are--

                                 ANNE
                                 (bursting)
                        Your biggest fans!

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        Okay, Ma, hands to yourself, like 
                        we talked about. Alright, I’m 
                        going to let you guys get to know 
                        each other, while I get to know 
                        Hope.

           Dr. Kurtz WINKS at Danny and EXITS with Hope.   Danny 
           immediately begins performing for his audience.

                                 DANNY
                        Now your son tells me you two 
                        actually perform some of my songs 
                        at your recreation center?  Is 
                        that true or is he putting me on?

           As Danny entertains, we PAN to Samantha and Tom, 
           watching.  This is clearly the deal that was struck 
           between Danny and Dr. Kurtz. 

           Samantha smiles at Tom, entertained by it all. 

           But Tom shakes his head and walks to the other side of 
           the room, unwilling to engage with any of it.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. WAITING ROOM - TWO HOURS LATER

           Dr. Kurtz’s parents finish PERFORMING the call and 
           response portion of Danny’s most popular song.  It is 
           endearingly terrible.

           They finish, and everyone CLAPS/CHEERS - especially Danny 
           who continues his charm offensive.

                                 DANNY
                        Now a lot of people don’t know 
                        this, but the first time I had the 
                        crowd sing the chorus back to me, 
                        it was actually because I forgot 
                        the words myself--

                                 ARNY
                        No!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Seriously?  Is that true?

                                 DANNY
                        It’s true, hand to God.

           Everyone LAUGHS.  Except Tom.  He sits there, stone-
           faced.  Anne turns towards Tom.

                                 ANNE
                        It must be just incredible to have 
                        such a fascinating, famous father.

                                 TOM
                        Oh yes.  It’s been a dream.

           Just then:

                                 DR. KURTZ (O.S.)
                        Okay.

           Dr. Kurtz emerges with Hope.  Hope has a HUGE LOLLYPOP in 
           her mouth.  She runs to her mother.

                                 DR. KURTZ (CONT’D)
                        Hope, would you mind staying here

                        minutes while I take your Mommy

           Dr. Kurtz motions for Samantha and Tom to join him.  
           Danny hangs back.  Dr. Kurtz notices.

                        C’mon, you.  You started all this.

           Danny hesitates, looks toward Tom.  Tom, exasperated, 
           doesn’t even care any more.  He throws up his hands in 
           defeat. 

           Danny joins them.

           INT. DR. KURTZ’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           They ENTER the office.  Samantha and Tom sit opposite 
           Kurtz (who sits down behind his desk).  Danny stands next 
           to them.

           Dr. Kurtz organizes some files, finally looks up.

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        So you guys have had a hell of a

           Samantha gets emotional quickly.

                        When she was three, she almost 
                        died.  She had a severe attack 
                        again when she was five--

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        Yeah, no, I saw the files.  Hell 
                        of a run.

           He SIGHS.

                                 DR. KURTZ (CONT’D)
                        Okay, as you know, Hope has an 
                        extreme case of acute asthma.  As 
                        I’m sure you also know, there’s no 
                        known cure for asthma, only 
                        management.  And unfortunately, I 
                        do not have a cure.  

           They deflate.

                        What I do have, are a couple of 
                        medications that are working at 
                        pretty much a one hundred percent 
                        clip for kids with Hope’s exact 
                        condition.  I’m going to show you 
                        some charts, charts belonging to a 
                        six year old boy named Bradley 
                        Scott, a patient of mine.

           He puts up CHARTS on his board.

                                 DR. KURTZ (CONT’D)
                        We’ll call these Bradley’s 
                        “before” files: his breathing 
                        levels, his lung capacities.  If 
                        you looked closely - and had a 
                        medical degree - you would see 
                        that they are pretty much 
                        identical to Hope’s.  

           More CHARTS go up.

                        These are Bradley’s “after” files. 
                        I can take you through them, but 
                        basically, they read as if Bradley 
                        is a child without ashthma.  I’ve 
                        had the same results with every 
                        child I’m treating at this age and 
                        these levels.  Now, the 
                        corticosteroid I use is very 
                        expensive and it’s not covered--

                                 DANNY
                        It’s fine.

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        ...and I’d require that Hope come 
                        to Houston once every six months 
                        which I know is difficult--

                                 DANNY
                        They’ll fly privately, it’s fine.

                                 TOM
                        Wait, wait, hold on...

           Tom and Samantha are lost.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Why have... why hasn’t...

           Tom stops, confused.

                        Why hasn’t anyone ever offered 
                        this before?  A lot of reasons: I 
                        run different tests, I use 
                        different treatments, a lot of it 
                        is new--

                                 TOM
                                 (skeptical)
                        So this is this some kind of 
                        untested clinical drug...

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        No, it’s basically the same thing 
                        Hope’s already been taking, just a 
                        slightly different variation.  
                        Listen, we’re going to have many 
                        more conversations before we do 
                        anything. You’ll be able to look 
                        over my research, confer with your 
                        own doctor, whatever you need.  If 
                        we move forward with this - which 
                        we absolutely should - she’s still 
                        going to have asthma.  You just 
                        won’t know it anymore.  Okay?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Wait, I’m sorry, I just... 

           She gathers herself as best she can.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        I have the spent the past six 
                        years...

           Her voice cracks.  Tom goes to comfort her but she shakes 
           him off, continues through emotion.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        I have spent the past six years 
                        wondering if every day... if every 
                        day will be the day.  The day that 
                        she wanders out of my sight, or 
                        the day something happens at 
                        school that I can’t control. The 
                        day the big one hits and takes our 
                        baby away from us.  I have spent 
                        every day of the past six years 
                        worrying about that.  And you’re 
                        saying...

                                 DR. KURTZ
                        Yeah, I’m saying you don’t have to 
                        do that anymore.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Samantha breaks down, instantly.  Tom takes her into his 
           arms.  Danny just stands there, watching, stunned.

           Dr. Kurtz stands from his desk, smiles, and shakes 
           Danny’s hand.

                                 DR. KURTZ (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give you all a minute.  
                                 (then)
                        You’ve got a good grandpa here. 

           He EXITS.  As Samantha continues crying into Tom’s chest, 
           Tom and Danny share stunned eye contact.  

           If it was possible, things just became even more 
           complicated.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Tom sits on the left side of the plane. Hope is asleep 
           across his lap.  He’s rubbing her back.  Samantha is 
           asleep on his shoulder.

           Danny sits on the other side of the plane, watching.

           They do not speak.

           EXT. TOM AND SAMANTHA’S HOUSE - LATER

           The limosine pulls to a stop in front.

           INT. LIMOSINE - CONTINUOUS

           Hope is still asleep, now on Tom’s lap.  Samantha opens 
           the door to the limo, steps out.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Here, I’ll take her.

                                 TOM
                        You sure?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m carrying one of your kids 
                        already, what’s another?

           Tom smiles.  She takes Hope, turns to Danny.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Um, so...

           Her eyes well up.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        I want to say something but I’m 
                        afraid I’m going to be too nice.

           Danny smiles, takes her off the hook.

                                 DANNY
                        Goodnight, Samantha.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Just... thank you.  I think.  Yes, 
                        definitely.  Thank you.

           She awkwardly EXITS, carrying Hope with her.

           ON DANNY AND TOM

           Alone.  Father and son, facing off.  No one speaks.  It’s 
           a Mexican standoff.  Finally - surprisingly - it is Tom 
           makes the first move. 

                                 TOM
                                 (serious)
                        You are a ridiculous man.

           Silence.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        A kid grows up not knowing his 
                        father, the only upside is that 
                        you get to picture him however you 
                        want.  But I didn’t even get that.  
                        I had to HEAR you on the radio and 
                        SEE you on TV: wearing those 
                        ridiculous suits, singing as if 
                        you didn’t have a care in the 
                        world.  It made my situation 
                        slightly unique.

           This hangs there. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I have spent my entire life trying 
                        to become the kind of man you 
                        aren’t.  I am exhausted.  You have 
                        no idea how exhausting that has 
                        been.  

           Danny thinks, explains:

                        When I met your mother... I was 
                        married at the time.  Strung out, 
                        on God knows what.  When I found 
                        out, I tried to send her money.  
                        She refused it.  She was stubborn, 
                        like you I guess.  Over the years, 
                        I always wanted to... I wanted a 
                        normal relationship with you 
                        but...

           He pauses.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        My life was extreme.  The drugs.  
                        Women. Travel. I thought you were 
                        better off, better off with a 
                        normal life.  And then, by the 
                        time I realized: I just thought it 
                        was too late.  I was too... 
                        ridiculous, as you say.  You were 
                        too old.  I don’t know.  I don’t 
                        know how I allowed it to go this 
                        long.

           Silence.  Tom finally leans forward.

                                 TOM
                        What you did today - for my family 
                        - we’re even now. Your slate is 
                        clean with me.  But that’s as far 
                        as this goes.  It ends here.  We 
                        end here.

                                 DANNY
                        I want to be a part of your life.

                                 TOM
                        No.  I can’t handle that right 
                        now.

                                 DANNY
                        I can’t just walk away from this.

                                 TOM
                        Well, you’re going to have to 
                        because it’s just not a good time--

                                 DANNY
                        Not a good time, what does that 
                        mean, not a good time--

                                 TOM
                        I’m sick.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           It comes out quickly, strongly, and unintentionally.  The 
           car goes silent. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Tom quickly closes the door to the limo.  Danny is lost.

                                 DANNY
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?  What do you mean you’re 
                        sick?

           Tom shakes his head.  He doesn’t want to do this.  
           Finally, he gives in.

                                 TOM
                        It’s what Mom died... 
                                 (beat, then)
                        It’s in the bloodstream.  And 
                        before you start: there’s no magic 
                        doctor in Texas who can cure this 
                        one. 

           Danny looks stunned.  A long, silent beat as he 
           processes.  Then:

                                 DANNY
                        Are you fucking kidding me!?

           Tom looks up, surprised.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        We just fixed HER!  And now you’re 
                        telling me... I mean, you’ve got 
                        to be fucking kidding me!  

           This hangs there, awkwardly.  Danny takes a breath, 
           regroups.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, obviously that was not a 
                        great reaction.  I’m sorry.

                                 TOM
                        No, don’t be silly! I’m the one 
                        who should be sorry.  After all: 
                        you’re Danny Collins!  What 
                        business do I have getting in the 
                        way of your happy ending?

                        the little movie you have playing 
                        in your head?  You show up out of 
                        nowhere, fix my kid, and we hold 
                        hands and cry as the music swells? 
                        Was that it?

                        Welcome home, Daddy, see what 
                        you’ve missed?  

           Danny’s head is spinning.

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know what to say.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t need you to say anything, 
                        I really don’t.  I just need you 
                        to leave. I have to go inside 
                        before Sam asks me what we were 
                        talking about--

                                 DANNY
                        Wait, wait, wait, hold on... she 
                        doesn’t know?

           Tom says nothing.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Are you insane?

                                 TOM
                        Three weeks of radiation.  They 
                        can tell within a month if I’ve 
                        responded at all.  If I do, maybe 
                        I have a chance.  Then we explore 
                        options.  If not, it progresses 
                        quickly.  Two years, max.

           Danny shakes his head, trying to process this.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (5)

                                 DANNY
                        Samantha--

                                 TOM
                        Is pregnant.  And Hope, as sick as 
                        she’s been... and now we’ve 
                        finally gotten some actual good 
                        news--

           He stops, retaining his calm.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I’m going on a business trip for 
                        three weeks.  That’s all she 
                        knows.  Once I know what I’m 
                        facing, I’ll tell her.  By then, 
                        at least the baby will be born.
                                 (then, serious)
                        You can’t say anything--

                                 DANNY
                        Tom--

                                 TOM
                        I am not playing.

                                 DANNY
                        Okay, okay.  I won’t say anything.

           Silence.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        You’ll need help.

           Nothing.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Have you told anyone?  A friend?

                                 TOM
                        My friends are her friends. 

                                 DANNY
                        Jesus.
                                 (then)
                        Okay.  Well, I’ll be there then.

                                 TOM
                        Be where?

                                 DANNY
                        There.  Just... there.  Wherever 
                        you need me.

           CONTINUED: (6)

                                 TOM
                        I don’t need you.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, well, you need someone and 
                        I’m all you’ve got so you’re gonna 
                        have to find a way to deal with 
                        it.  Now go inside to your wife.

                                 TOM
                        But--

                                 DANNY
                        It’s not open for discussion, Tom.  
                        Go.  Now.

           It’s authoritative.  Fatherly.  Tom slowly obeys, gets 
           out of the car.  For the first time since we’ve met him, 
           he looks like a lost little boy.

           From inside the car, Danny nods at him. Reassuring.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, we’ll fix this.  It’ll 
                        all be okay.

           Tom stares ahead blankly, suddenly confused by all the 
           dynamics in play.  Danny closes the door to the car.  

           Tom watches the limo drive away.

           BACK INSIDE THE CAR

           Now in the clear, Danny drops the performance. He slumps 
           against his seat, overwhelmed.

           INT. WOODCLIFF LAKE HILTON - LATER

           Danny walks into the lobby.  Mary sees him, smiles.

                                 MARY
                        How’d it go?

           Danny looks up, dazed.

                                 DANNY
                        Come here please?

           Mary walks over from behind the front desk, confused.  
           Danny simply steps forward and... HUGS her.  That’s all, 
           just a long, hard, hug.  

           After a long beat he backs away.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARY
                        Wow.  Some day, huh?

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah.

                                 MARY
                        You need to go write.  Right now.  
                        You need to go write.

                                 DANNY
                        I’d rather take you to dinner and 
                        drown myself in scotch.

                                 MARY
                        You go finish that song, then 
                        we’ll have that dinner.  Now go.

           Like his son before him, Danny has no choice but to obey 
           the command.  He NODS, heads off to his room.

           INT. DANNY’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Danny sits in his CHAIR, holding his GUITAR, looking at 
           the LETTER FROM LENNON.

           Next to him he has a YELLOW NOTE PAD.  We can see that 
           he’s written down LYRICS.  A lot of lyrics.

           He begins to play the song we’ve heard him start twice.  
           But this time, he plays it all the way through. 

           The SONG covers a...

           MONTAGE - OVER THE NEXT MONTH

           Note: occasionally, we pop in for bits of dialogue...

           EXT. TOM’S OFFICE - DAY

           A large office building for a BOTTLING COMPANY.

           Danny sits out front, in his car.  Tom EMERGES from the 
           building and spots the Maserati immediately.  Danny waves 
           him toward the car.

           Tom shakes his head, gets in the car without a word.

           INT. ONCOLOGY OFFICE - DAY

           A DOCTOR gives Tom an I.V.  Danny stands by his side.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DOCTOR
                        Okay, Mr. Donnelly.  I won’t lie, 
                        this isn’t gonna be pleasant.  You 
                        ready?

           Tom NODS.  Danny watches, concerned.

           INT. NEW YORK CITY HOTEL - AFTERNOON

           A small boutique hotel.  Expensive looking.

           Danny pulls the car up to the Valet, gets out, and runs 
           around to the other side to help a WOOZY TOM from the 
           car. Tom resists his help as best he can.

           INT. TOM AND SAM’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Danny stands at the front door, RINGS the bell.  Samantha 
           OPENS the door.  She’s surprised to see him and, clearly, 
           unsure what to do.

           Danny holds up his recurrent peace offering: A BAG OF 
           BAGELS.  Samantha hesitates, then... lets him inside.

           INT. DANNY’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           We go back to Danny in his hotel room, playing his song.  

           PULL BACK to reveal that Mary now sits in the room with 
           him, listening.

           PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal:

           Danny’s CELL PHONE, VIBRATING on the night stand next to 
           the Lennon letter.  It goes to VOICE-MAIL.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Where Frank hangs up his phone, frustrated.  He’s not 
           reaching Danny.

           EXT. WOODCLIFF LAKE HILTON - AFTERNOON

           Where Danny tentatively hands NICKY ERNST the keys to his 
           MASERATI and watches JAMIE hop in the front seat.

           Nicky gives Danny a thumbs up, and TAKES OFF.  Way too 
           fast.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Danny steps back.  Mary stands there.  She looks at him, 
           smiles, and MOUTHS the words:

                                 MARY
                        You’re fucking crazy.

           INT. TOM’S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           Tom lies in one bed, recuperating.  Danny in the other.  
           They watch ESPN together, in silence.  

           Danny looks at Tom, notices something.  He gets up, 
           brings him some water, feels his forehead.  Tom does what 
           he can to resist, but Danny is determined and wins out.

           Finally satisfied, Danny retakes his position on his own 
           bed.

           They continue watching ESPN in silence.

           INT. TOM AND SAMANTHA’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Danny sits at the kitchen table with Hope, DRAWING 
           PICTURES with her.  One of her pictures is a drawing of 
           HER FAMILY.  She’s included “Gran Pa.”

           Samantha cooks in the background, watching.  She smiles.

           INT. ONCOLOGY OFFICE - MORNING

           Where Tom, treatment completed, gets final instructions 
           from the Doctor.  

           As the Doctor talks, Danny writes everything down in a 
           NOTEBOOK.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Okay, Tom, so three weeks from 
                        today, we’ll look at results 
                        together, hope for the best.

           They SHAKE, say their GOOD-BYES. 

           INT. DANNY’S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           Where Danny finishes the FINAL VERSE of the song and puts 
           down the guitar.  He looks across the room at Mary, 
           nervously.

           Mary CLAPS, steps forward.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DANNY
                        You like?

                                 MARY
                        I love.

                                 DANNY
                        Can I take you to dinner now?

                                 MARY
                        Play it in concert, then you can 
                        take me to dinner.

                                 DANNY
                        You are such a dinner tease.

           There’s a KNOCK at the door.  Danny goes to answer.

                                 MARY
                        I am not a dinner tease.

                                 DANNY
                        You are a huge dinner tease.

           Danny answers the door.  Frank stands there.  He does not 
           look happy.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ve been calling.

                                 DANNY
                        Frank!  Sorry, busy few weeks.

           Frank looks inside, sees Mary.

                                 FRANK
                        Apparently.
                                 (then)
                        May I?

           Danny motions for Frank to come in.  Danny makes 
           introductions.

                                 DANNY
                        Mary, my best friend and manager, 
                        Frank Grubman.  Frank, this is 
                        Mary.  She is my new girlfriend.

                                 FRANK
                                 (surprised)
                        Really?

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MARY
                                 (equally surprised)
                        Really?

                                 DANNY
                        Well, I’m hopeful.  At some point, 
                        obviously, she’ll need to stay 
                        over.  Oh, and have dinner with 
                        me.
                                 (to Frank)
                        Huge dinner tease.

                                 MARY
                        I am not.

                                 DANNY
                        She keeps moving the goalposts for 
                        dinner.

           Mary LAUGHS.  Frank watches, perplexed.  What’s with all 
           the cutesy?  Where the hell has his pal Danny gone?  

                                 FRANK
                        Mary, would you mind if I had a 
                        word with Danny in private?  It’s 
                        kind of a business thing.

                                 MARY
                        No, of course.

           Mary takes her leave.

                                 DANNY
                        Dinner tonight?

                                 MARY
                        You’re ridiculous. 

           GIGGLING, Mary closes the door.  Danny looks at Frank, 
           smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        Right?

                                 FRANK
                                 (admitting)
                        She’s lovely.

                                 DANNY
                        And age appropriate.

                                 FRANK
                        She’s a solid ten years younger 
                        than you, Danny.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 DANNY
                        Baby-steps.

           Frank smiles, sits.  Danny sits next to him.

                                 FRANK
                        We need to talk.

                                 DANNY
                        We do.  I have a lot to tell you 
                        about, Pal--

                                 FRANK
                        Danny, unfortunately I’ve got the 
                        manager hat back on right now.  

           Danny nods. Something’s clearly wrong.  He changes tone, 
           serious.

                                 DANNY
                        What’s up?

           Frank thinks.  How to say this?

                                 FRANK
                        Do you remember a few years ago we 
                        were watching that thing on ESPN 
                        about Mike Tyson?  And they were 
                        saying how even though he’d made 
                        like twenty million a fight, he’d 
                        blown it all, and now he could 
                        barely afford to feed the pigeons 
                        on his roof?  Remember how we 
                        couldn’t believe someone could be 
                        that stupid?

           Danny processes this.  Then, child-like, asks:

                                 DANNY
                        I’m Mike Tyson?

                                 FRANK
                        Well, not quite, but... I’ve been 
                        going over things with Ken and 
                        you’re not quite where you think 
                        you are.

           Danny nods, staying calm.

                                 DANNY
                        Okay.  Where am I?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 FRANK
                        You’re a little bit ahead, once we 
                        sell properties and pay off some 
                        debt.  But just a little.

           Danny lets this sink in.

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t understand.  How?

                                 FRANK
                        Lot of things. That schiester we 
                        were using before Ken, he hurt us.  
                        We shouldn’t have sold your 
                        publishing rights so early.  All 
                        the properties, the housing 
                        markets have collapsed everywhere.  
                        The private planes, your 
                        lifestyle, the Madoff thing 
                        absolutely killed you, as you 
                        know.  You’re not bankrupt or 
                        anything, but you need to 
                        understand how serious this is.

                                 DANNY
                        Okay, I understand. 
                                 (then)
                        What do I do?

                                 FRANK
                        One of two things: you start 
                        living like a normal human - buy a 
                        Prius, fly Continental, that kind 
                        of shit... or you go back on tour.  
                        This last tour was my retirement 
                        plan for you.  We had a big piece: 
                        merchandise, sold-out arenas--

                                 DANNY
                        No, I know.  

           They sit in silence for a long beat.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been writing, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Danny--

                                 DANNY
                        It’s good.  I’m telling you, Mary 
                        thinks it’s really good.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (5)

                                 FRANK
                        The Woodcliff Lake Hotel manager?  
                        Oh, okay.  Well now I feel better.

                                 DANNY
                        Careful.

           Frank eases up.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Just book me a gig.  

                                 FRANK
                        A “gig?”

                                 DANNY
                        Something local.  Not an arena. In 
                        the city or somewhere in Jersey.  
                        Like what Springsteen would do if 
                        he was just popping in somewhere.

                                 FRANK
                        “Like what Springsteen would do?”  
                        Danny, do you even hear yourself.

                                 DANNY
                        This is how we fix it, Frank.  I’m 
                        telling you: the new stuff will 
                        play.  Then we tour. And the bonus 
                        is that I won’t have to feel like 
                        killing myself every time I step 
                        on the stage.

           Frank SIGHS, shakes his head.  Stands.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay.  I call you with the 
                        details.

           Frank stops at the door.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Just don’t buy any pigeons.

           Frank EXITS.  

           Danny thinks for a beat, then picks up his GUITAR and 
           continues working... a man possessed.

           INT. TOM AND SAM’S HOUSE - MORNING (DAYS LATER)

           Tom, Samantha, Hope, and Danny sit at the kitchen table.  
           Samantha is even more pregnant now... she’s huge.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Danny taps a SPOON on his coffee MUG.  He has an 
           announcement.

                                 DANNY
                        So I’m playing a gig Friday night.  
                        Joe’s Pub in the city. 

                                 HOPE
                        What’s a gig?

                                 DANNY
                        It’s where I sing in front of 
                        people, Hon’.

                                 HOPE
                        I want to hear you sing!

                                 DANNY
                        And I want you to hear me sing.  
                        More than anything.  But only if 
                        it’s okay with your parents.

                                 TOM
                                 (concerned)
                        It’s at a pub?

                                 DANNY
                        It’s really more of a small music 
                        venue, like a theatre.  
                                 (off their looks)
                        Seriously!  I wouldn’t invite her 
                        if it was bad. It’s non smoking, 
                        there will be a sectioned-off 
                        table for you and everything.

           Tom and Samantha share a look, still hesitant.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Show starts at 7:30.  Done by 
                        9:00.  Late, but not too late.
                                 (pleading)
                        It’s a big one for me.  It would 
                        help if I could see these cheeks.

           He squeezes Hope’s CHEEKS.  She GIGGLES.  Tom SHRUGS at 
           Samantha.  It’s her call.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Okay.

           Hope and Danny share a HIGH FIVE.

                                 HOPE
                        These cheeks will be there!

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Everyone LAUGHS, but laughing makes Tom COUGH, loudly.  
           Sam goes to get him water.

                                 SAMANTHA
                                 (to Danny)
                        Do you hear this?
                                 (then, to Tom)
                        Would you get yourself to the 
                        doctor already, Tom?  

           Danny looks at Tom.  Tom quickly looks away.

                                 TOM
                        It’s just a little bug.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Little bug, it’s been ever since 
                        you got back.  Hope, is your Daddy 
                        the most stubborn man on the 
                        planet?

                                 HOPE
                        Don’t be so stubborn, Daddy.

                                 TOM
                        I’m fine, really.

           Samantha feels his head.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Finally have everyone in this 
                        house healthy and he insists on 
                        walking around like the living 
                        dead instead of getting 
                        antibiotics.  Stubborn man.

                                 HOPE
                        Stubborn man!

           Samantha smiles, kisses Hope’s head.  Tom and Danny share 
           a look but say nothing.  

           Over the top of their silence we:

           CUE SOUND: THUMP.  THUMP.  THUMP.

           EXT. JOE’S PUB - EVENING (ONE WEEK LATER)

           A small, intimate music venue in the East Village.  

           We can hear from the outside (as when we first saw Danny 
           in concert) that the crowd inside is awaiting their star.
           INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The ritual:

           Danny’s hand comes into frame, touches...

           THE GOLD CROSS, which drops down into his chest.

           But instead of opening the cross in search of drugs, now 
           the hand lowers, touching:

           THE LETTER FROM LENNON.  Sitting on a nearby table.  A 
           source of inspiration.

           We PULL BACK, revealing:

           DANNY

           For the first time since we’ve known him, Danny isn’t 
           dressed like a borderline Vegas pimp.  

           He’s wearing a casual polo shirt.  Slacks.  He looks...

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        Jesus, you look like Lee Trevino.

           Danny looks up, Frank stands there.  Danny smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        Really?  Cause that’s what I was 
                        going for.

           Frank CHUCKLES, ENTERS.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay, real quick: the place is 
                        packed.  The band’s out there and 
                        ready if you want them--

                                 DANNY
                        I won’t.

           Frank NODS.

                                 FRANK
                        Your family’s table is up front, 
                        they just arrived.  I saved a spot 
                        for Mary with them.

           Danny nods, deep breath.

                                 DANNY
                        Thanks, Frank.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Yeah, thanks Frank.

           They turn around. 

           MARY stands at the door. Frank smiles, takes his leave.

                                 FRANK
                        Break a leg, Kid.

                                 DANNY
                        Just tell me whose and I will. 
                        Anything for you, Pal.

           An old joke.  Frank winks and EXITS, nodding to Mary as 
           he passes.  She steps inside.

                                 MARY
                        Just came to wish you luck. 
                                 (beat)
                        You nervous?

                                 DANNY
                        Mary, I have done this a zillion 
                        times and I’ve never been nervous.  
                        Hand to God, not once.
                                 (then)
                        I’m nervous as hell.

           She nods, understanding.  He snaps out of it, feigning 
           calm.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        So bad news for you.  Looks like 
                        you’re finally going to have to 
                        let me buy you dinner.

                                 MARY
                        Or we could skip the dinner and I 
                        could just stay over tonight?

           Danny looks up, surprised.  He smiles.

                                 DANNY
                                 (playful)
                        Okay, okay. Put a little more 
                        pressure on me tonight, I see what 
                        you’re doing.

           She LAUGHS.

                                 MARY
                        Meet you in your room after.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           She holds A KEY up.

                                 DANNY
                        How’d you get that?

                                 MARY
                        Perk of the job.

           Mary walks to the door, stops.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a weird thing to say, I know, 
                        considering I haven’t known you 
                        very long.  But I’m very proud of 
                        you, Danny.

           She EXITS.  Danny takes a deep breath, stands.

           EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           As when we first met him, Danny walks down a corridor to 
           the stage.  But now there’s no entourage.  This walk is 
           far lonelier.  The hall much smaller.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Danny?

           Danny turns.  There stands SOPHIE (his earlier young 
           fiance’) and her “boyfriend” JUDD.

                                 DANNY
                        Sophie!?  What the hell are you 
                        doing here?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Came to support our sugardaddy. 
                        Frank let us backstage, we just 
                        wanted to say hey.

           Danny turns towards Judd, smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        Busywork, how are you?

           Judd smiles back.

                                 JUDD
                        Busy.

                                 DANNY
                        Ha.  Very good.
                                 (then, to Sophie)
                        You look well.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SOPHIE
                                 (big news)
                        I’ve decided to start a career.

                                 DANNY
                        Good for you, Sophie.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’m going to be a movie star.

           Danny looks at her for a beat, then...

                                 DANNY
                        Alright, gotta go.  Everyone 
                        waiting and all.  

                                 SOPHIE
                        We’ll party after?

                                 DANNY
                        Always, Darling.

           He kisses her cheek, continues on down the hall.  As he 
           walks, Danny LAUGHS to himself, shakes his head...

           He’s come a long way.

           FROM BEHIND

           We watch Danny make his way toward the BACKSTAGE CURTAIN.  
           We’re once again tracking him from behind (just as at his 
           first concert).

           But now, instead of a mysterious figure in a white suit, 
           he’s just a Grandpa in a golf shirt and slacks.

           ON HIS FEET

           No more platform shoes.  Brown loafers have taken their 
           place.

           AT THE CURTAIN

           He pauses, stops.  Puts a bottle of water (not beer) down 
           on the floor.

           He cracks his head each way, then:

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Yep.

           He EXITS onto stage.  From behind the curtain, we hear 
           the small crowd go APESHIT.
           INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Danny takes the stage, looks out.  It’s a packed house.

           RIGHT UP FRONT

           Sits his family at a table.  Mary is with them.  So is 
           Frank.  He smiles at them.  

           Hope SCREAMS through the crowd, bursting with excitement.

           ON DANNY

           He looks behind him, towards the back of the stage:

           His BAND is ready, unsure what they’re supposed to do.  

           Danny simply nods at them and heads towards:

           A SINGLE STOOL

           Center stage.  And resting against the stool, his GUITAR.  
           Danny sits, picks up the instrument.  

           He leans into the microphone.

                                 DANNY
                        Thanks for coming.

           Danny starts strumming the opening chords of his NEW 
           SONG.  We recognize the melody instantly.  As he strums, 
           he takes in the crowd.

           DANNY’S POV OF THE CROWD

           A WOMAN SCREAMS for Danny to play his MOST POPULAR SONG.

           AN OLDER COUPLE CLAP THEIR HANDS in unison, anticipating.

           In fact...

           EVERYONE is clapping.  In UNISON.  These are Danny 
           Collins fans. They know what happens first.

           Everything SLOWS DOWN.

           ANOTHER FAN screams for Danny’s most popular song.  AND 
           ANOTHER.

           AT HER TABLE, Hope looks around, thrilled.  She’s 
           CLAPPING with everyone.  Tom and Samantha LAUGH, clap 
           with her.  Frank, too.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           BACK TO DANNY

           Suddenly frozen.  He just sits there, playing the same 
           GUITAR CHORD over and over again, watching the CHANTING 
           CROWD. His adoring granddaughter.  His son.  He knows 
           what they want from him.

           We watch it happen, just like that - in an instant: all 
           progress lost.  There’s too many people.  He’s too old.  
           He can’t just change it up suddenly.  He knows what they 
           want and he has to give it to them.  He’s been doing it 
           for too many years to stop now.

           Slowly, he stops strumming.  Puts down the guitar.  His 
           eyes are glossy.

           He turns to his band, NODS.  They quickly pick up their 
           INSTRUMENTS.

           Danny leans into his microphone and announces, sadly:

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I think you know this one.

           The crowd goes nuts.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        One, two, three, four--

           The band launches into Danny’s MOST FAMOUS SONG.  The 
           crowd goes ballistic.  

           As Danny goes through the motions, we push in CLOSER AND 
           CLOSER on his face.  He’s singing.  He’s performing.

           He’s breaking his own heart.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. STAGE - TWO HOURS LATER

           Danny finishes up a song with a fake flourish.

                                 DANNY
                        Thank you!  Thank you for coming!  
                        Goodnight.

           Danny EXITS stage, quickly.  
           INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           As soon as he’s out of sight, behind the curtain, he 
           sinks.  He’s a broken man.

                                 SOPHIE (O.S.)
                        Great show, Danny!

           Danny looks up.  Sophie and Judd stand in the hallway.  

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        We couldn’t even find a seat!

           Sophie SNIFFLES, rubs her nose.  Danny doesn’t even 
           hesitate.

                                 DANNY
                        What do you have on you?

                                 SOPHIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 DANNY
                        You know what I mean.

           Sophie smiles.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I got it all, Baby.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Danny chugs from a bottle of SCOTCH, numbing himself as 
           quickly as possible.  Judd SMOKES in the corner.  Sophie 
           pours some COKE OUT onto A TRAY, hands it to Danny.

           But it’s not a tray... she’s poured a line on the FRAMED 
           LETTER FROM LENNON.

           Sad, horrific, irony.

           Danny shakes his head, hesitates, then bends down to do 
           it.  Just then:

                                 HOPE (O.S.)
                        Grandpa!

           Danny looks up and drops the letter to the ground, as 
           coke goes flying.

           AT THE DOOR

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tom, Samantha, and Hope stand there.

                                 HOPE (CONT’D)
                                 (confused)
                        Grandpa?

           Samantha quickly pulls Hope back.  Tom looks on, shocked.

                                 TOM
                        Nice.  
                                 (pointedly)
                        Real nice, Grandpa.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t--

                                 TOM
                        Don’t.  Don’t even bother.
                                 (then)
                        Jesus.

           He turns to go.  Danny calls out:

                                 DANNY
                        Yes, keep judging me, Tom, you’re 
                        great at that.  When you finish - 
                        you know, being so perfect and 
                        honorable - maybe you should talk 
                        to your wife about what you did on 
                        your “three week business trip.”

           As soon as he says it he regrets it.  Tom freezes.  
           Samantha (pushing Hope out the door) stops, confused.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Huh?

           Tom glares at Danny.  Samantha looks at Tom, it’s too 
           weird not to comment on.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        What’s he talking about?

           Tom turns to her.  She looks at him, expectant.  He knows 
           it’s over.

                                 TOM
                        We’ll talk at home, okay?  

           He leads his family out the door, but not before turning 
           back towards Danny.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        If you ever come near my family 
                        again...

           He trails off.  The message is clear.  Nothing left to 
           say.  And with that...

           He EXITS.  

           ON DANNY

           Completely undone.  He bends down, picks up the LENNON 
           LETTER off of the ground.  

           ON THE LETTER

           It’s cracked, smattered with cocaine. Symbolic.

           BACK TO DANNY

           Who turns towards Sophie and Judd.

                                 DANNY
                        Let’s get the fuck out of here.

           CUE SONG: Cold Turkey written by John Lennon.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - LATER

           Danny’s Maserati RACES away, through the streets of NYC.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. DANNY’S HOTEL ROOM - HOURS LATER.

           We hear a KEY go into a door.  The door opens.  

           UNSEEN ENTRANT’S POV:

           Walking through the small hotel room:

           The room is trashed.  Bottles and cans everywhere. The 
           LENNON LETTER lies on the floor, cracked.

           There’s an overturned ROOM SERVICE TABLE in the center of 
           the room.

           And on the bed, Danny is sprawled out, unconscious.  His 
           shirt half unbuttoned.  A BOTTLE OF BOOZE on his chest.  

           THE CAMERA TURNS AROUND

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Revealing Mary, the source of our POV.  Taking in the 
           train-wreck.  Just then...

           SOPHIE stumbles out of the bathroom.  As per usual, her 
           boobs are on display.

                                 SOPHIE
                                 (wasted)
                        Who are you?

                                 MARY
                        I... um... I work for the hotel.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Oh, good.  We need more towels, 
                        can you get us more towels?  And 
                        some beer.

                                 MARY
                        Yes.  More towels.  And some beer.

           The conversation causes Danny to STIR.  He opens his 
           eyes, sees...

                                 DANNY
                        Mary.

           Mary turns, walks out of the room.

           EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mary heads for the elevator.  Half stumbling, half 
           dressed, Danny runs after her.

                                 DANNY
                        Mary!  Mary, wait!

           Mary turns.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        She’s not... it’s not what it 
                        looks like.  Her boyfriend is 
                        probably passed out in the bathtub 
                        for Christ sake.

                                 MARY
                        Please, you think I care about 
                        that?  
                                 (beat, then)
                        What the hell happened tonight, 
                        Danny?

           Danny looks down.

                        I couldn’t.  I just couldn’t.

           She NODS.

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, well, I can’t either.

                                 DANNY
                        Mary--

                                 MARY
                        I’m just a regular old woman, 
                        Danny--

                                 DANNY
                        I keep telling you you’re not.  
                        Not to me.

                                 MARY
                        Oh, I am.  I assure you, I am.
                                 (then)
                        This can’t work, Danny. I was 
                        married to Ronny Tischler.  You 
                        were married to Mary Anne from 
                        Gilligan’s Island. I work at a 
                        Hilton in New Jersey.  You’re a 
                        famous, rock star musician who 
                        does cocaine and trashes hotel 
                        rooms.  And I thought maybe that 
                        was over.  I thought maybe that 
                        part of your life...
                                 (then)
                        You’re too much for me.

                                 DANNY
                        Mary.

           The elevator door opens.

                                 MARY
                        You should have played the song, 
                        Danny.  You should have at least 
                        played the one song.

           Mary GETS IN THE ELEVATOR, leaving Danny alone in the 
           hallway.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Danny RE-ENTERS his room, slowly begins cleaning up the 
           mess. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

           He picks up the LENNON LETTER from the floor, looks at 
           it.

                                 DANNY
                                 (to letter)
                        Fuck you John.

           INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NEXT MORNING

           Danny rolls his SUITCASE into the elevator.  He’s 
           leaving.  

           As the elevator descends, it plays (once again) THE MUSAK 
           of Danny’s most famous song.  Danny NODS, knowingly.  

           One last final body blow before he goes.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - MORNING

           Danny rolls his SUITCASE through the lobby. Jamie works 
           behind the front desk.  Danny sees her.

                                 DANNY
                        You take care of yourself, Jaime.

                                 JAIME
                        You too, Mr. Collins.

                                 DANNY
                        And be good to Nicky.  He’s a good 
                        boy.  Wonderful face.  You two 
                        will have wonderful-faced children 
                        one day.

                                 JAIME
                                 (smiling)
                        Okay, will do.

           Danny looks behind Jamie, toward the OFFICE that hides 
           beyond the front desk.  Jaime shakes her head “no.”   
           Mary doesn’t want to see him.

           Danny nods, steps up to the desk, and yells out:

                                 DANNY

                        BUT NOT GIRLY. GOODBYE!

           Danny turns and EXITS the hotel.

           EXT. WOODCLIFF LAKE HILTON - CONTINUOUS

           Nicky pulls up the Maserati, loads in the SUITCASE.  

                                 DANNY
                        Nicky, it’s been a pleasure.

                                 NICKY
                        The pleasure has definitely been 
                        mine, Danny.

           Danny reaches into his pocket to TIP Nicky.  But he’s got 
           no cash.

                                 DANNY
                        Shit.
                                 (then)
                        You know what?

           Danny goes to his trunk, removes the suitcase, and 
           WHISTLES for a cab (in line at the nearby stand).

           He hands NICKY the KEYS to the Maserati.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                                 (re: the tip)
                        I’m out of hundreds.

                                 NICKY
                        You’re kidding me.

           Danny smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        The second you stop finding it 
                        awesome, you give it to someone 
                        else.  Deal?

                                 NICKY
                        Deal.

                                 DANNY
                        Good.  Now get the hell out of 
                        here.

           CONTINUED:

           Nicky doesn’t know what to do with himself.  He BEAR HUGS 
           Danny, gets in the car, and ZOOMS off.  

           Danny watches him go, then heads for his cab, when:

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Wait!

           Mary runs out, catches up to him.  They stand there in 
           silence for a moment, looking out at the street.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Did you mean what you said?

                        Obviously.

           Danny smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        Best soap I’ve ever seen.  And

                        I’m gonna play my new songs.  On 
                        the tour. At least some of them. 
                        We’ll see what happens.

                                 MARY
                        I know what will happen.

           Danny loads his suitcase into the TAXI.

                        Tour comes back through New York

                        ticket if you’d like.

                                 MARY
                        I’d like that.

                                 DANNY
                        Maybe I could take you to dinner 
                        after the show?

                        You’re relentless.

           Danny gets in the taxi, lowers the window.

                                 DANNY
                        I left you something in the room.

                        You never know.

           Danny smiles, winks, and taps the window.  He came to the 
           Woodcliff Lake Hilton in a red Maserati.  He leaves in a 
           yellow taxi.

           INT. DANNY’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Mary ENTERS the room with TWO CLEANING LADIES. But the 
           room...

           Is immaculate.  Danny has cleaned it himself.

           On the bed, sits the LENNON LETTER.  Next to it, a SECOND 
           NOTE, from Danny:

           It reads: “What do you think about that, Mary Sinclair?”

           INT. ARENA - ONE WEEK LATER

           We check in with Danny, as he rehearses with his band in 
           the empty arena.

                                 DANNY
                        Okay, from there we go into one of 
                        my new ones.  I’ll just grab the 
                        stool, you guys hang tight for 
                        five, cool?

           INT. TOM AND SAMANTHA’S HOUSE - MORNING (DAYS LATER)

           Samantha lies in bed, now WILDLY pregnant, barely able to 
           move.

           Tom takes her hand, kisses it.  He goes to pull away but  
           she won’t let him go. She has tears in her eyes.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He nods at her: a solid, steadying look.  He kisses her 
           again, then EXITS.

           EXT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER

           Tom pulls up to the doctor’s office, alone.  Parks.  
           Takes a deep breath.  EXITS the car.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER

           Tom ENTERS the waiting room, turns a corner only to 
           see...

           Danny.  Sitting there.  Alone. Waiting.

           Tom shakes his head, SIGHS.  He checks in with a NURSE.

                                 TOM
                        Tom Donnelly.  Here for Dr. 
                        Silverman.

                                 NURSE
                        Just have a seat, Mr. Donnelly.

           Tom sits two seats away from Danny.  They sit in silence 
           for a long beat.  Finally:

                                 DANNY
                        Was she pissed?

                                 TOM
                        No, she was thrilled.  It’s been a 
                        great few weeks, thanks.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m truly sorry, Tom.  It’s no 
                        excuse but it was a horrible night 
                        for me.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, well, it was a worse night 
                        for me, so...

           Silence.  Long beat.

                                 DANNY
                        Why isn’t she...

                                 TOM
                        She’s any day now, can barely even 
                        move from bed.  
                                 (MORE)

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Plus, whatever the news is, I want 
                        her to hear it from me.  Not some 
                        doctor she doesn’t even know.

           A beat, then...

                                 DANNY
                        Tom, I--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Donnelly?

           The NURSE beckons.  They STAND, interrupted, and follow.

           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Tom and Danny wait, on an EXAM TABLE, side-by-side.  

           Danny looks at Tom’s foot.  It’s TAPPING, relentlessly.  
           They sit there for a while like this.  Finally:

                                 TOM
                        If the news is bad...

           Tom stops, gathering himself.

                                 DANNY
                        Tom, c’mon--

                                 TOM
                        No, listen to me.  If this goes 
                        bad, Samantha, and Hope, and the 
                        baby--

                                 DANNY
                        Will be taken care of.  You don’t 
                        need to worry about that.

           Tom nods.  He’s starting to cry but doing the best he can 
           to hold it back.

                                 TOM
                        Okay.  Good.  Thank you.  

           A beat.  Tom speaks, almost to himself:

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I am not ready to leave them.  I 
                        am not ready.

           Danny puts his hand on Tom’s knee, steadying his shaky 
           leg.  Danny takes a deep breath himself.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DANNY
                        You know... this doctor, whenever 
                        he comes in here, he either calls 
                        you Mr. Donnelly or Tom?  Ever 
                        notice that?  Always one or the 
                        other.  When he calls you Mr. 
                        Donnelly, it’s never good news.  
                        Next thing you know he’s shooting 
                        you with something that makes you 
                        throw up, or telling you he 
                        doesn’t like your levels.  I’m 
                        serious, I’ve taken notes, he 
                        literally does it every time.
                                 (then)
                        But when he calls you Tom, it’s 
                        always good news.  Like that time 
                        he liked your white cell count, 
                        remember that?  He called you Tom.  
                        So that’s what we want right now.  
                        We want him to open that door, 
                        come in here, and call you “Tom.”  
                        That’s all we want.  Let’s focus 
                        on that, okay?

           Tom nods, takes a deep breath.

                                 TOM
                        Okay.

                                 DANNY
                        It’s going to be alright, Son.  
                        Everything will be alright.

                                 TOM
                                 (choking up)
                        You promise?

           Danny looks at his son.

                                 DANNY
                        Have I ever let you down before?

           Tom CRACKS UP through his tears.  Crying now...

                                 TOM
                        You’re a ridiculous man, you know 
                        that?

                                 DANNY
                        I’ve been told, yes.

           Tom considers the man sitting next to him, then, giving 
           in to it... he puts his hand on top of his father’s.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The camera swings behind them, slowly, till it lands on 
           their backs (facing the door).  As it swings around, 
           Danny continues talking, soothing.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Yep, he’s just gonna open that 
                        door, call you Tom, and it will 
                        all be alright.  I promise you,  
                        it will all be alright.

           We’re behind them now, father and son, touching hands in 
           silence.  And just then...

           The door OPENS.  Their heads jolt up and we...

                                                            FADE TO BLACK.

                                  THE END.

           But not before we hear, over black:

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Okay, Tom, so here’s where we 
                        are...

           A NOTE TO THE READER:

           In 1971, John Lennon read an interview in a small music 
           magazine.  The subject of the interview was a twenty-one 
           year old musician named Steve Tilston.  In the interview, 
           Tilston admitted wondering if future wealth and fame 
           might one day hinder his ability to write powerful songs.

           And so... John Lennon wrote Steve Tilston a letter.

           In the letter, Lennon offered Tilston advice and 
           friendship, as well as his home phone number.

           Steve Tilston did not receive the letter until 2005.  He 
           was nearly sixty years old at the time.
