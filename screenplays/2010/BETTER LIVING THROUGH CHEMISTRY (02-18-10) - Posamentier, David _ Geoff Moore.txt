           OVER BLACK, WE HEAR A MAN’S HEAVY BREATHING. Raspy, 
           strained, urgent.  It’s then overlapped with...

                                 CHILDREN’S VOICES (O.S.)
                        I pledge allegiance to the flag of 
                        the United States of America...

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE MORNING 

           A quaint upper-middle class neighborhood filled with 
           perfectly manicured lawns. Each with one Prius and one 
           SUV in the driveway. Property taxes are high here.

                                 CHILDREN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        ...and to the Republic for which 
                        it stands...

           A MAN enters frame pedaling a HIGH PERFORMANCE 10-SPEED 
           BICYCLE. Dressed in nice gray pants, blue button down 
           shirt, black shoes, and a WHITE LAB COAT that flaps in 
           the breeze behind him. This is DOUGLAS VARNEY, and he is 
           sweaty...it’s HIS BREATHING we’ve been hearing. 

                                 CHILDREN’S VOICES (O.S.)
                        ...one nation, under God, 
                        indivisible...

           Checking his watch, he starts to pedal even harder but 
           LOSES HIS FOOTING. His SMOOTH BOTTOM LOAFERS slip off the 
           “clip-in” pedals causing the bike to wobble violently 
           which sends Doug tumbling to the ground. Hard.

           His knee badly skinned and his pants ripped, Doug shakes 
           it off, gathers his bike, and continues riding.

           EXT. WOODBURY MIDDLE SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER

           Leaning into the turn, Doug zips around the corner and 
           sails toward the BIKE RACK, skidding to a halt and 
           dropping his bicycle amidst the scooters and BMX’s before 
           jogging into the school with a slight limp in his gait.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Okay, class. I’d like us all to 
                        welcome Mr. Varney.

                                 CLASS OF KIDS (O.S.)
                        Good-morning-Mister-Varney.
           INT. WOODBURY MIDDLE SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A FULL CLASS of 7th graders sit at their desks, all eyes 
           forward on DOUG. Behind him the blackboard reads, “Bring 
           Your Dad To School Day.”

                                 DOUG
                        Good morning, everyone.

           Doug is DRENCHED IN SWEAT. Pit stains have penetrated 
           through his lab coat and an archipelago of dark dampness 
           rapidly spreads across his chest and belly. 

           The more-than-a-little-pathetic-looking teacher, MISS 
           D’FRANCESCO, smiles thinly...

                                 MISS D’FRANCESCO
                        Class, Mr. Varney is going to tell 
                        us all about being a Pharmacist.

           As special as she’s made “pharmacist” sound, the class 
           remains nonplussed.

                                 DOUG
                        Good morning, everyone.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        You said that already.

           A heavyset man, with badly thinning hair and a blue-tooth 
           headset in his ear (BRIAN) chimes in. He’s one of the few 
           other DADS IN SUITS there today.

                                 DOUG
                        Right. So, how many of you here 
                        know what a Pharmacist does?

           Silence, met only by more silence. It’s a tough room. 
           Doug is floundering until he makes eye contact with a 
           SHAGGY-HAIRED BOY in a ‘Linkin Park’ t-shirt. Doug 
           smiles, the Boy sends a smile back - “you can do it.”

           A Preppy-looking Blonde Boy speaks up...

                                 PREPPY BOY
                        You work at the Pharmacy.

                                 DOUG
                        I actually own the Pharmacy.

                                 PREPPY BOY
                        But it’s called ‘Bishop’s.’

                                 DOUG
                        (hissing) You wanna see the 
                        mortgage paperwork?

           The Preppy Boy recoils at Doug’s venom.
                                 YOUNG GIRL (O.S.)
                        So, you’re a doctor then?

           Doug sighs. He hates that question.

                                 DOUG
                        Sort of. I work with doctors to 
                        help people feel better.

                                 YOUNG GIRL #2
                        You make the medicine, right?

                                 DOUG
                        Yes. It’s why a pharmacist is also 
                        called a “chemist.” When you get 
                        sick, the doctor prescribes 
                        medicine. I make sure you get the 
                        right kind and amount, and--

                                 BRIAN (O.S.)
                        --That’s when the insurance 
                        companies swoop in and screw you.

           This elicits chuckles from the gallery of Other Dads.

                                 DOUG
                        Insurance companies certainly do 
                        complicate things. But these days 
                        they cover most prescription 
                        medications, unless it’s something 
                        personal or cosmetic. Like 
                        Propecia. For example.

           Doug gives a QUICK SIDE GLANCE towards Brian who goes 
           silent, gently touching his THIN HAIR.

                                 YOUNG BOY #2
                        I bought a water gun at the 
                        pharmacy.

                                 YOUNG GIRL #1
                        And candy.

                                 YOUNG GIRL #2
                        And a hair dryer.

                                 DOUG
                        Well, yes, nowadays pharmacies 
                        offer a variety of products and 
                        services.

                                 ANOTHER BOY
                        Condoms!

           This sends the class into hysterics...
                                 MISS D’FRANCESCO
                        Come on, people. Let’s show Mr. 
                        Varney a little respect. 

           The class quiets down, when we hear...

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        You’re bleeding.

           Looking down, we see Doug is in fact bleeding. A steady 
           trickle of blood oozes from a MAKESHIFT BANDAGE and 
           stains his torn pant leg. He moves to touch it 
           when...BOOM! 

           The CLASSROOM DOOR is flung open, startling Doug and the 
           kids. A POLICE OFFICER STANDS THERE, looking pissed. He 
           strides into the room, heading straight for Doug.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Douglas Varney, you’re under 
                        arrest.

                                 DOUG
                        Wait, hold on a second...

           He grimaces as the Officer grabs his arm and twists it 
           behind his back, controlling him.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Jesus--

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        --Hands on your head, now!

           Unnerved as he’s violently shoved onto the desk knocking 
           over a cup of coffee, Doug’s head is pinned down by a 
           nightstick...

                                 DOUG
                        Hey! Take it easy, man--

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        --You have the right to remain 
                        silent. Anything you say can and 
                        will be used against you in a 
                        court of law.

           The cop KICKS HIS FEET OUT FROM UNDER HIM, dropping him 
           to the floor, slapping on cuffs with lightning quick 
           efficiency. The kids are awestruck.

                                 POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand these rights as 
                        I’ve just read them to you?

           Now hog-tied, Doug can only lay there and submit, face 
           inches from a piece of FLATTENED OLD GUM, as the officer 
           finishes reading him his Miranda Rights. 
           All sounds BLEED OUT SILENT, Doug’s eyes close and he 
           looks peaceful, as though accepting his fate.

                                                            FADE TO WHITE.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        You can’t help everyone. But 
                        everybody can help someone.

           The CLIPPED, MEASURED BRITISH VOICE sounds an awful lot 
           like DAME JUDI DENCH. In fact, for our purposes, IT IS.

           FADE UP ON...

           DOUG’S FACE, still smushed sideways...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But, when it comes right down to 
                        it, how does a man truly help 
                        himself? 

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           FROM ABOVE, we see his head wedged between the bed and 
           night stand. Relegated to a mere sliver of mattress. 

           That’s because his wife, KARA BISHOP-VARNEY has spread 
           out during the night. EYE MASK ON, matching silk pajamas, 
           she breathes loudly through her mouth.

           Doug looks at her...then looks at his THROBBING MORNING 
           HARD-ON under the covers...then decides to make a move. 
           He readjusts himself, spooning up next to his wife, 
           stabbing her with his erection. She stirs...

                                 KARA
                        Come on, Doug. It’s a weekday.

           In one quick movement she pulls back the covers and leaps 
           out of bed, leaving Doug alone with his wilting boner.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        For Douglas Varney of Woodbury, 
                        Connecticut, that was a question 
                        he’d never really considered.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stifling a yawn, Doug knocks on a door and pushes it 
           open. 

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, Ethan. Time to get up.

           The bedroom is PITCH BLACK. Doug moves to the window and 
           raises the shades...yet NO LIGHT comes in. 
                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        What the hell...?

           After flipping on a lamp he finds the bed empty. And, 
           after making a closer inspection, he flakes a chip of 
           paint off the WINDOW with his fingernail, finding the 
           GLASS HAS BEEN PAINTED BLACK. 

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - LATER

           Doug heads down the stairs, when he hears a clatter...

                                 DOUG
                        Ethan!?

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           ETHAN, their PUDGY, SHAGGY-HAIRED 12 YEAR OLD SON - who 
           we recognize as the ‘Linkin Park’ kid from the classroom - 
           is dragging a CHAIR over to reach the highest cupboard.

           He swings open the cupboard and lunges behind the 
           granola, dried fruit, and other health foods to retrieve 
           a LARGE BOX OF OREOS. Removing a single sleeve of 
           cookies, he puts the box back and climbs down.

           DOUG, hidden from view, continues to watch...

           Now sitting at the table, wooden spoon in hand, Ethan 
           proceeds to WHACK the shit out of the sleeve of Oreos, 
           reducing them to small chunks.  

           He shakes out ALL THE PIECES into a large bowl, then 
           tilts a bottle of STRAWBERRY QUIK into the bowl of Oreo
           pieces.

                                 DOUG
                        (hushed) Jesus.

           Clicking the remote control, Ethan turns on the TV and 
           watches “Good Morning America” while devouring his 
           homemade cereal.

                                 DOUG (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        I appreciate his ingenuity, but 
                        maybe we shouldn’t keep Oreos in 
                        the house anymore?

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - BASEMENT EXERCISE ROOM - LATER

           Kara is dripping in sweat, finishing up an impossible 
           Yoga pose, quite literally standing on her head. Doug, 
           now dressed for work, stands talking TO HER FEET.
                                 KARA
                        It’s important for him to know 
                        when he behaves that the treats we 
                        promise him are real. If we take 
                        the cookies out of the house, 
                        those promises become empty.

                                 DOUG
                        He’s not a dog, Kara.

           Her focus still on her yoga and breathing, she shifts 
           into another pose. Doug is getting restless...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Do you know he covered his windows 
                        in black paint?

           She bows forward into downward dog, then into plank pose, 
           sealing in her practice, before looking Doug in the 
           face...as if joining the conversation for real now. 

                                 KARA
                        Yes. He asked me before he did it.

                                 DOUG
                        And you think it’s okay for him to 
                        live in a black box?

                                 KARA
                        We need to remain supportive, even 
                        if his interests are different
                        than ours. Sooner or later he’ll 
                        realize it’s nice to have sunlight 
                        and he’ll remove the paint.

           Walking to a small BAR AREA, she shakes out a SERIES OF 
           VITAMINS from the countless bottles. 

                                 DOUG
                        Taking so many vitamins at once 
                        cancels out the impact. 

                                 KARA
                        Dad disagrees.

                                 DOUG
                        He’s not a doctor.

           She throws the pills in her mouth and swallows them with 
           a giant chug of protein drink.

                                 KARA
                        Neither are you. Excuse me...

           Kara nudges past him towards a HEAVY BAG hanging from the 
           ceiling on a chain mount, and begins to pummel it.
                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        What happened to all that talk 
                        about getting up early and working 
                        out together? It would be really 
                        good...for both of you.

                                 DOUG
                        I’ve been so busy lately.

                                 KARA
                        Busy sneaking candy bars.

           She reaches out and tweaks Doug’s NASCENT MAN-BOOB. He 
           angrily knocks Kara’s hand away and walks out in a huff.

           For the briefest moment, Kara looks sorry for what she 
           said...then she just shrugs and returns to KICKBOXING the 
           heavy bag, and WE CUT TO...

           INT. DOUG’S PRIUS - MORNING

           Doug drives through the picturesque, affluent VILLAGE OF 
           WOODBURY. Home to New York City commuters, it’s the kind 
           of place that still has well-kept cobblestone streets, a 
           gazebo, and a LARGE RESTORED CLOCK in its town square.

           Rounding the bend we see a LARGE CRANE removing a sign 
           from atop one of the quaint “shoppes.” Parking his car 
           across the street, Doug watches as a worn wooden sign 
           that reads “BISHOP’S Rx” is lowered down. 

           He kills the engine and grabs the TWO CUPS OF COFFEE from 
           the cup holders. Sighing, he stares out the window.

           EXT. WOODBURY TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           An OLDER MAN, with a full, thick head of white hair and a 
           bushy moustache to match, turns to spot Doug - eyeballs 
           him up and down, unimpressed - then turns right back to 
           supervising the sign change. This is WALTER BISHOP. He 
           wears golf apparel in social settings.

                                 DOUG
                        Morning, Walt. Brought you a nice 
                        hot cup-a-joe.

           Walter lifts his hand to reveal he already has Coffee.

                                 WALTER
                        Wasn’t sure if you were going to 
                        make it this morning.

                                 DOUG
                        You kidding me? This is a big day. 
                        The changing of the guard. The 
                        apprentice replacing the master--
                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        --Almost done here, Walt.

           A BURLY MAN in Carhart overalls saunters over and gives 
           Walter a firm handshake. 

                                 WALTER
                        Rick Scruggs, this is my son-in-
                        law Douglas Varney.

           Rick extends his hand. Still holding the two cups of 
           coffee, Doug can’t shake so offers him a coffee instead.

                                 RICK SCRUGGS
                        (holding up his coffee) No thanks, 
                        Doug. (then) So, Walt, what you 
                        want to do with the old sign?

                                 WALTER
                        Probably just take ‘er with me. 40 
                        years that sign’s been up. Lotta 
                        memories.

                                 RICK SCRUGGS
                        It’ll make a nice addition to your 
                        rec room.

                                 WALTER
                        That’s a good idea, Rick!

                                 DOUG
                        Memories. 

           They look at Doug waiting for more, but it never comes. 
           The awkward silence is broken by the BEEP, BEEP, BEEP of 
           the crane moving into place, drawing Rick’s attention. He 
           heads back towards the work site...

                                 RICK SCRUGGS
                        It’s show time. Excuse me...

                                 DOUG
                        He seems like a nice guy--

                                 WALTER
                        --You transfer the insurance like 
                        I told you to?

                                 DOUG
                        All taken care of.

                                 WALTER
                        Sign the mortgage paperwork with 
                        Al Dupuis over at First National?

                                 DOUG
                        Aye-aye, cap’n.
                                 WALTER
                        Restock the douches?

                                 DOUG
                        The moment they come in. You’ve 
                        got nothing to worry about Walter. 
                        You’ve taught me a lot these past 
                        few years, the business is in good 
                        hands.

                                 WALTER
                        (re: the sign) Here we go...

           Doug looks up, smiling with pride as the NEW SIGN is 
           hoisted into place...but that smile quickly fades as he 
           sees the new sign. Sleek, contemporary, bold, it 
           reads...“BISHOP’S Rx.”

                                 DOUG
                        So I guess you decided to go with 
                        the ‘Bishop’s’ sign after all

                                 WALTER
                        It is the name of the store.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, right, of course. But, I 
                        just thought, when we agreed to 
                        buy the business from you--

                                 WALTER
                        --Let’s just put this to rest 
                        right now. I had offers from a 
                        number of heavy hitters, Doug. 
                        CVS, Walgreens...all the big 
                        chains. This is a very profitable 
                        little outpost here. It was a gift 
                        that I agreed to let you and Kara 
                        buy the business.  

                                 DOUG
                        And we appreciate it. Really. It’s 
                        just that--

                                 WALTER
                        --What? You planning on calling it 
                        “Varney’s” or something?

           Walter lets out a guffaw as Doug balks, clearly his plan.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Doug, listen. People know
                        “Bishop’s.” It’s a name that 
                        Woodbury has trusted for a long, 
                        long time. For as long as that 
                        clock has been around. 
                        And, like that clock, they can 
                        count on our service to always be 
                        right. Accurate. Trustworthy.

           Walter starts towards his car... 

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Besides, ‘Bishop’ is a robust, 
                        healthy sounding name. And 
                        Varney...well, I don’t recall any 
                        chess pieces named a “Varney.”  
                        Know what I mean?

           They reach Walter’s ostentatious GOLD CADILLAC where he 
           gets in and starts the car. A beat, then he rolls down 
           the window...

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Almost forgot.

           He holds out a SET OF KEYS. Hands still full, Doug 
           extends a finger for Walter to hang them on.

                                 DOUG
                        Thanks again, Walter. For 
                        everything.

                                 WALTER
                        Don’t forget about the douches.

           And he pulls away leaving Doug out on the sidewalk to 
           watch as the new BISHOP’S SIGN is bolted into place. Doug 
           POURS OUT the coffee nobody wanted.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Doug had high hopes. He knew today 
                        was the day he became the man in 
                        charge. He knew today was the day 
                        he would reap the benefits of 
                        running his own business. But, 
                        despite all this...

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - MOMENTS LATER

           Doug steps inside and flips on the lights, illuminating 
           the rows filled with all manner of items. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        ...Doug knew that today was going 
                        to be just like every other day.

           STATIC SHOTS OF ALL THE STUFF WE SEE IN PHARMACIES BUT 
           NEVER THINK ABOUT...

           - Candies, greeting cards, plastic toys.
           - The glass case full of collectible ceramic and crystal 
           woodland creature figurines.

           - Feminine hygiene products, diapers, and an EMPTY SHELF 
           SPACE where THE DOUCHES should be.

           - An ANTIQUE marble mortar & pestle - and other relics of 
           a bygone era - on display in the big bay window.

           - Finally, we end up at the PHARMACIST STATION. That big 
           WHITE COUNTER HIGH UP in the back, behind which sit 
           endless rows of filled prescription bags, mixing agents, 
           a potent variety of chemicals used to create drugs. 

           THE FAX MACHINE whirs to life, printing out a new 
           prescription that lies on top of a small stack in the 
           tray. Off Doug GRABBING THEM...

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - AFTERNOON - LATER

           Donning his short-sleeved white PHARMACIST’S JACKET, Doug 
           works diligently behind the counter preparing an order. 
           He grabs a LARGE JAR, but finds the top screwed on 
           impossibly tight. 

           Giving it all he’s got, he finally frees it but SENDS 
           PILLS FLYING everywhere in the process.

                                 DOUG
                        (sotto) Fuck.

           Doug quickly clean things up, clumsily CRUSHING A FEW 
           PILLS that hit the floor with his shoe when, over a 
           scratchy P.A. we hear...

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (P.A.)
                        Consult!

                                 DOUG
                        Okay, one second.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (P.A.)
                        Connnn-sult!

           Doug leaves the mess for later, adjourning to...

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - COUNTER AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Awaiting Doug is JANET, the 20-something local who 
           couldn’t handle the high pressure academic environment at 
           Woodbury Community College. To say that she doesn’t give 
           a shit about this job would be an overstatement.

           At the counter waits a MAN (ARNOLD MORELLO) about Doug’s 
           age, dressed in a POSTAL WORKERS UNIFORM.
                                 JANET
                        He needs a consult.

                                 DOUG
                        I heard you the first 2 times, 
                        thank you Janet.

           She hands him the WHITE PRESCRIPTION BAG while she smacks 
           her gum loudly.

                                 POSTAL WORKER
                        Where’s Walter?

                                 JANET
                        Playing golf.

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, Janet. I think the Dr. 
                        Scholls display may have tipped 
                        over again, would you mind...

           Popping her gum, she hops up on the counter, spins her 
           legs around top, and drops down the other side...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about that. She’s just...I’m 
                        taking over the business for him.

                                 POSTAL WORKER
                        Oh. I’m Arnold Morello. Nice to 
                        meet you.

                                 DOUG
                        And I’m Douglas Varney. You’ve 
                        delivered my mail for over ten 
                        years.

           Arnold just nods vacantly.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Okay, then. Let’s see what we’ve 
                        got here.

           Doug opens the bag while leading him down to the 
           “private” side of the counter.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        There were many, many aspects of 
                        Doug’s occupation that he 
                        disliked. However, he took great 
                        pride in his consults. 

           CLOSE ON a pill bottle as Doug pulls it out, reading the 
           LABEL intently.

                        It’s not that Doug found joy in 
                        explaining proper dosage and side 
                        effects of his customers’ 
                        medications. Rather, he found 
                        solace in the fact that he would 
                        always know more about his 
                        customers than they would ever 
                        know about him.

           ON DOUG, the faintest grin in the corner of his mouth. 
           You wouldn’t notice it unless you knew to look.

                        As the one pharmacist in a small 
                        town, filling prescriptions let 
                        Doug into the private, dark 
                        corners of his neighbors’ lives. 
                        People like Daphne Zucker.

           medication from Doug.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Daphne struggled with her weight 
                        ever since she was a little girl. 
                        Doug provided her with Lipitor to 
                        manage cholesterol, always 
                        reminding her to avoid grapefruit.

           Daphne slaps down a BABY RUTH and 2 SNICKERS as well...

                        However, avoiding fruit was never 
                        the problem.

           Next up, a series of NERVOUS-LOOKING HOUSEWIVES come up

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Because some days are dark even 
                        when the sun is shining over 
                        soccer games, Doug was there with 
                        Lexapro, Zoloft, and in the case 
                        of Kaye Tashman--a large quantity 
                        of Xanax.

           Holding on KAYE TASHMAN, who balances one baby while her 
           other toddler runs around like crazy.
                                 KAYE TASHMAN
                        Just one of those days. Ya know?

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        All too well, Kaye. All too well.

           IN QUICK SUCCESSION WE SEE...

           Ethan’s teacher, Mrs. D’Francesco approach the counter.

                        And for Ethan’s teacher, Susan 
                        D’Francesco, Tegretol. Because she 
                        was bipolar.

           A MAN IN HIS THIRTIES who looks FIFTY, with aged skin and 
           discolored teeth.

                        Kathleen Bergman. Sadly, Lysodren. 
                        Because her cancer knew no 
                        remission. 

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - COUNTER - REAL TIME

           CLOSE on the bottle Doug is holding. He rolls it over and 
           we see “Morello, Arnold--VALTREX.”

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        And in the case of Arnold Morello, 
                        Valtrex. To help control outbreaks 
                        of his freshly acquired case of 
                        genital herpes. 

           Doug looks back up at Arnold, noticing the dread on his 
           face and the WEDDING RING on his finger. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Dirty old sod.

                                 DOUG
                        Well, okay then Mr. Morello--

                                 ARNOLD 
                        --Call me, Arnold. Please.
                                 DOUG
                        Arnold. (then) It’s pretty simple 
                        really. Just take one of these a 
                        day - with or without food - and 
                        be sure to finish all the pills.

                                 ARNOLD 
                        Then...then it will go away.

                                 DOUG
                        It will never really go away. This 
                        just helps suppress outbreaks.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Outbreaks? Jesus Christ.

           Arnold is still coming to grips with this. Looking even 
           more pathetic in his stupid Postal Carrier shorts.

                                 DOUG
                        Your physician did cover this, 
                        right?

                                 ARNOLD   
                        Yes, it’s just...it’s all very 
                        complicated. I’d never been to 
                        Atlantic City before.

                                 DOUG
                        I understand. It’s a lot to 
                        digest. Just be diligent about the 
                        medication and you’ll feel better 
                        before you know it.

           Doug places the pill bottle back in the bag and hands it 
           to Arnold Morello, who leaves only slightly less upset 
           than when he arrived.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Jesus. What’s that guy on?

           Leaning on the counter is a DUMPY 30-something with a 
           wispy chin beard, an assortment of shitty mall jewelry, 
           and a “Dream Theater” t-shirt underneath his Bishop’s 
           windbreaker. This is NOAH, and it’s no surprise he’s 
           ended up a delivery man for a pharmacy.

                                 DOUG
                        That’s confidential.

                                 NOAH
                        Anti-depressants, I bet. Postal 
                        Worker, at the end of his rope 
                        just trying not to, you know...

           Mimes like he’s blowing people away with A MACHINE GUN.
                                 DOUG
                        Noah!

                                 NOAH
                        Just sayin’, he looked pretty 
                        fucked up, that’s all.

           Noah holds up his fake machine gun and blows fake smoke 
           off it, laughing just a bit too hard...

                                 DOUG
                        Noah, have you been drinking?

                                 NOAH
                        (defensive) What? No. I mean, give 
                        me some credit, Doug. It’s like, 
                        not even 11 o’clock yet. Geez.

                                 DOUG
                        Okay, sorry. Don’t wander off, 
                        I’ll have a new batch of 
                        deliveries ready for you soon.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, about that. I know I said 
                        I’d be on ‘til closing tonight but 
                        my buddy Rio just landed tickets 
                        to see ‘Widespread’ in Hartford 
                        tonight. Think it’d be all right 
                        if I knocked off a bit early?

                                 DOUG
                        You promise to get all the 
                        deliveries done before you go?

                                 NOAH
                        You have my word.

                                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           A PLASTIC BOX, marked “DELIVERIES.” And it’s full, 
           brimming over with bags.

                                 DOUG (V.O.)
                        Hi honey...yeah, I’m gonna be 
                        late...yes, Noah. I know...I know.  
                        It’s fine, just eat without me.

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - LATER

           Doug grabs a Snickers, a Baby Ruth, and a bag of Skittles 
           from the candy rack. 

                                 DOUG (V.O.)
                        I’ll eat something...yes, healthy. 
                        Be home later...me too, bye.
           And a Kit-Kat for dessert...

           EXT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - MOMENTS LATER

           Doug, annoyed, opens his car door and throws the box of 
           deliveries, along with a clipboard, onto the passenger 
           seat and gets in...taking a bite of Snickers Bar.

           EXT. STREETS OF WOODBURY - NIGHT

           We watch as Doug makes a series of deliveries, still 
           maintaining a relatively pleasant air about him when he 
           GREETS PEOPLE AT THEIR DOORS, despite being exhausted and 
           annoyed at having to carry out this task himself. He 
           checks his clipboard and sees one last stop.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

           Doug’s car peels off onto DONNYBROOK COURT, a NARROW dirt 
           road with a thick canopy of trees making it almost pitch 
           black. The headlights provide the only light. Doug is 
           starting to lose his patience when he comes upon...

           EXT. ENORMOUS TUDOR STYLE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           With a sprawling lawn that slopes down toward the road, 
           it is an impressive structure. Doug’s car winds up the 
           lengthy driveway, finally coming to a stop behind a big, 
           silver Mercedes S500.

           INT. DOUG’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Killing the engine, Doug leans over and sifts through the 
           plastic bin pulling out the meds that correlate to his 
           clipboard...

           INSERT: A few bags labelled for, “Roberts, Jack” while 
           the other 6 are labelled “Roberts, Elizabeth”...

                                 DOUG
                        Junkies.

           EXT. ENORMOUS TUDOR STYLE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Doug ascends the long stone path to the front door and 
           rings the doorbell, instantly startled by the sound of 
           barking dogs - BIG DOGS - bracing himself for what is 
           sure to leap up on his chest when the door is opened.

           The muffled sound of a woman shouting at the animals, 
           quiets them instantly, followed by the lock unhinging and 
           the door swinging open.
           Standing there in the dim light, is the aforementioned 
           “ROBERTS, ELIZABETH.” 30ish and STUNNING. Doug’s eyes 
           move to the floor, as she stands there wearing a slip, 
           open silk robe draped over it, little left to the 
           imagination...

                                 DOUG
                        You must be Mrs. Roberts?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        At present, yes.

                                 DOUG
                        I believe these belong to you.

           Doug sticks out his hands, each holding the white 
           prescription bags. Elizabeth doesn’t look ready to put 
           down her OLIVE FILLED tumbler of vodka...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Would you mind? It’s a bit 
                        chilly...

           She takes a few steps back and nods, indicating for him 
           to enter the foyer. 

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Elizabeth closes the door behind Doug. He catches a 
           glimpse of her now-erect NIPPLES piercing her slip...and 
           she catches Doug catching a glimpse. Closing her robe...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Like I said, a bit chilly.

                                 DOUG
                        Of course. I won’t be long. Let’s 
                        just get you sorted out.

           Doug methodically checks the clipboard with each bag he 
           puts down, being sure to tick each box as he goes. As the 
           bags stack up...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        (re: the huge order of meds) 
                        Probably think I’m some kind of 
                        junkie, huh?

                                 DOUG
                        It’s not my business to know how 
                        people got sick, just how to get 
                        them feeling better.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Catchy.
           She smiles at his polite discretion. Then finishes her 
           drink. From the looks of it, SHE’S HAD A COUPLE.

                                 DOUG
                        Okay, it looks like there was some 
                        confusion with the insurance 
                        company and the Valium isn’t--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --Not an issue. How much do I owe?

                                 DOUG
                        Two-hundred and fifteen dollars, 
                        plus the eight dollar delivery 
                        fee...but I’ll waive that.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s very nice of you. But won’t 
                        your boss be mad?

                                 DOUG
                        I am my boss. I mean I won’t be 
                        mad. I mean, I’m the pharmacist.

           He opens his parka to reveal his WHITE LAB COAT on 
           underneath. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So, you’re Bishop?

                                 DOUG
                        Varney. Douglas Varney.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        But the bags say Bishop’s--

                                 DOUG
                        --That going to be cash or check?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Right. Of course. Just give me one 
                        minute.

           Elizabeth shuffles O.S. while Doug waits...

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You ever think of calling it 
                        Varney’s?!

           Doug grits his teeth, casually walking around peeking 
           into the ADJOINING ROOMS; each tastefully decorated with 
           all the trappings of extraordinary wealth. Wandering...

           TO THE LIVING ROOM, he spots a large PAINTING of 
           Elizabeth with a HANDSOME, OLDER, “SILVER FOX” kind of 
           guy over the fireplace. Doug moves in to inspect it. 
           The Handsome Older Guy towers over two German Shepherds, 
           while Elizabeth sits on a chair in the middle, diminished 
           in impact if not beauty. As Doug stares at the painting, 
           we hear a LOW GROWL.

           Doug slowly turns to find THOSE SAME TWO ENORMOUS GERMAN 
           SHEPHERDS, in the flesh and perched in the doorway, 
           BARRICADING him into the room. Tongues wagging, back on 
           their haunches, impeccably trained they stare at Doug 
           growling, but do not budge. 

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        We had it done right before the 
                        wedding.

           The dogs SUDDENLY FLEE at the sound of Elizabeth 
           returning, fresh drink in hand.

                                 DOUG
                        Sorry. I didn’t mean to...

           She waves her hand, stop being silly.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So, what do you think?

                                 DOUG
                        Of the portrait? It’s nice.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Jack insisted on it. They even 
                        gave him bigger pecs. Ridiculous. 

           On a second look, Older Handsome Guy is pretty chiseled.

                                 DOUG
                        Looks like a comic book character.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re right. “The Adventures of 
                        Rich Man and Trophy Wife.”

                                 DOUG
                        I’m sure he’s a great guy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He certainly thinks so.

           Doug shifts gears by reviewing his clipboard again...

                                 DOUG
                        So, I double checked the bill here 
                        and...
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Right. Of course. This is 
                        embarrassing, but turns out I only 
                        have about 20 dollars on me and my 
                        husband is the only one with a 
                        checkbook around here. And, of 
                        course, he’s still in the city.

                                 DOUG
                        Oh. Um, okay--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --I know, I know. I’m in this
                        house with a seventy-thousand 
                        dollar Benz out in the driveway, a 
                        ten thousand dollar plasma on the 
                        wall, and I barely have enough 
                        cash to order a pizza.

                                 DOUG
                        I was going to say, not a problem. 
                        You can just come by the store and 
                        pay the rest when you have it. But 
                        I’ll have to take the Mercedes as 
                        collateral, of course.

           Elizabeth laughs and grabs Doug’s forearm, partly for 
           balance - she is buzzed - but also because she’s 
           genuinely touched.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re just one of those 
                        authentically nice guys, aren’t 
                        you? Honest and sweet.

                                 DOUG
                        Well...yeah. I guess so. Maybe why 
                        girls always saw me as a best 
                        friend and not a boyfriend--

           She then WRAPS DOUG UP IN A HUG before he can react...he 
           stiffens, but slowly hugs her back. Her eyes are moist.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Girls don’t appreciate simple 
                        kindness, but women do. I do.

           Without warning, she turns her head slightly and KISSES 
           DOUG right on the mouth. Lingering for a few seconds, 
           before separating. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Doug.
                                 DOUG
                        (flustered) OK. Good, then. I’m 
                        just going to get going and you 
                        can drop by the store. You know 
                        where it is?

           She taps one of the White Paper Bags, noting the address.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Yes. Okay. And...good night.

           EXT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Doug exits the house and walks briskly towards his car. 
           Looking back at the house he sees Elizabeth smiling at 
           him from the large bay window, causing him to TRIP A 
           LITTLE, before getting in his car and driving away.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Kara sits at the center island reading some sort of 
           fitness magazine and drinking a glass of red wine. 

                                 DOUG
                        Sorry I’m so late. But the 
                        deliveries were all out of order 
                        and I didn’t know all the 
                        addresses - Noah didn’t even put 
                        them in the ledger--

                                 KARA
                        --I got a call today from Ethan’s 
                        school.

           It’s clear that Kara isn’t interested in anything Doug is 
           saying, which is fine by him this evening...

                                 DOUG
                        Oh. Okay. What’s the problem?

           Doug has moved to the freezer and pulled out the VODKA, 
           making himself a drink...

                                 KARA
                        Principal “hyphenated-name” 
                        wouldn’t say over the phone. Wants 
                        to have us in ASAP for a 
                        parent/teacher conference.

                                 DOUG
                        He painted his windows black. Why 
                        are you acting so surprised?

                                 KARA
                        Since when do you drink vodka?
                                 DOUG
                        Oh...I just felt like having--

                                 KARA
                        --Please, just go talk to him.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

           Ascending the stairs, he hears BLARING HEAVY METAL MUSIC. 
           Pushing the door open, he discovers...

           Ethan standing in front of his TV playing GUITAR HERO 
           with his SHIRT OFF.

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, Pal. How was school today?

           Ethan does not answer, focused only on the game. Doug 
           CONSIDERS his son’s awkward age. Puberty coming hard and 
           fast with the first few zits and whiskers of facial hair 
           sprouting...along with an unattractive PAUNCH around his 
           waist. It’s a dangerous time for Ethan, like it is for 
           most 12 year old boys.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Think maybe you’d want to come out 
                        with us for a Varney family ride 
                        this weekend?

                                 ETHAN
                        Are you serious right now?

                                 DOUG
                        You know, that bike we bought you 
                        was pretty expensive and--

                                 ETHAN
                        --I don’t think so.

                                 DOUG
                        Aw, c’mon. The open road, sunshine 
                        on your face, wind in your hair. 
                        Give it a chance, it could be fun.

           Not taking his eyes from the Television, Ethan strides 
           over and KICKS THE DOOR SHUT right in Doug’s face. 

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        So, you’ll think about it? 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Doug yearned to connect with 
                        Ethan. To spend more time with 
                        him. But he knew that his son 
                        could see right through his lies. 

                                                                   CUT TO:
           EXT. COUNTRY ROADSIDE - AFTERNOON

           The orange, yellow, and brown foliage dot either side of 
           this otherwise desolate stretch of road. A DIM HUM is 
           heard growing closer, and closer and closer, until...

           A PACK OF CYCLISTS BUZZ past us down the road. Mostly 
           men, with a few women peppered into the group, all decked 
           head-to-toe in spandex and helmets. It is clear they are 
           NOT PROFESSIONALS but WEEKEND WARRIORS, as many of them 
           labor to keep pace; snug spandex only highlights their 
           imperfections.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Because there was absolutely 
                        nothing fun about the Varney 
                        weekend bike rides at all.

           Somewhere towards the middle is DOUG, decked out in 
           ridiculously bright NEON SPANDEX. He is sweating 
           profusely, doing his best to keep up.

                                 KARA (O.S.)
                        On your left!

           Startled by the shout, Doug glances in THE SHAKY LITTLE 
           REARVIEW MIRROR attached to his helmet...

           MIRROR POV SHOWS: KARA, bearing down on Doug like a 
           cheetah closing on a wounded gazelle...and WHIZZING PAST 
           HIM, super close, nearly knocking him off balance. 

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        See ya around.

           And she effortlessly GAINS ON THE PACK, swiftly reaching 
           the lead rider (ED) and giving him a high five.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        After reading an article in 
                        Redbook on the merits of Road 
                        Cycling as a means to shed excess 
                        baby weight, Kara gave it a 
                        try...and took to it immediately.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROADSIDE - YEARS EARLIER

           Nearly identical fall setting. Kara and Doug, each a 
           little younger, ride along together. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        It was just the kind of carefree 
                        activity Kara sought for them when 
                        they first met in college. And 
                        Doug was onboard. He saw bicycling 
                        as a chance for them to do 
                        something as a couple. 
                        To recapture the feelings that 
                        made him first fall in love with 
                        his wife. And for a moment, it was 
                        fun.

           Doug finding enjoyment in the simple pleasures while 
           Kara, decked out in FULL PRO SPANDEX, pedals with 
           controlled intensity.

           PULL BACK WIDE to reveal that BABY ETHAN - also in 
           matching spandex and helmet - rides on the back in a 
           BABYSEAT. Kara bears down and swiftly pulls away from her 
           husband.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        One brief moment. It quickly 
                        became a chore. A frustration. One 
                        more thing Doug did because 
                        someone told him to.

           Doug gives a half-hearted attempt to keep up but quickly 
           stops and coasts...Kara doesn’t even look back.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        For Kara, though, cycling quickly 
                        turned from hobby into obsession.

           INT. “WHEELS ON FIRE” SPINNING STUDIO - DAY

           A crowded class of SWEATY SUBURBAN WOMEN chug away on 
           stationary bikes as Kara leads them in the front.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Then occupation. Inspiring her 
                        business at the nearby Glen Rock 
                        Shopping Center.

           MUSIC THUMPING, Kara “motivates them” by yelling through 
           her headset.

                                 KARA
                        C’mon! Grind it out! Cottage 
                        cheese is for breakfast, not 
                        thighs!

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        And led her to victory at the Tour 
                        de Woodbury 30 miler.

           EXT. WOODBURY TOWN SQUARE - FLASHBACK

           A crowd of people cheer as Kara is awarded a LARGE 
           TROPHY, atop the podium...
                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        She’s taken first place 5 of the 
                        last 6 years. 8 times total. The 
                        race has now become the 
                        cornerstone of Kara’s year. 

           In a series of JUMP CUTS, we see her accept one GIANT 
           TROPHY after another, only her spandex outfit changing. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And the bane of Doug’s existence.

           Doug looks on from the crowd with a series of GENERIC 
           RIBBONS pinned to his spandex shirt that read “Good Job!” 
           or “Sportsmanship!”

                                 VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        On your left!

           EXT. COUNTRY ROADSIDE - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS

           The last of the group pulls away from Doug. He instantly 
           shifts gears and begins to ENJOY HIS RIDE AGAIN. Sun on 
           his face, wind in his hair, he even stops to admire a 
           FLOCK OF NEWBORN DUCKS being lead by their mother.

           EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - LATER

           Quaint, upmarket restaurant set on the DOCK OF A MARINA, 
           a FLEET OF BICYCLES leaning against the side.

           After a beat, Doug coasts into frame, stopping out front. 
           Parking his bike, taking off his helmet, he dismounts, 
           SLIPPING A LITTLE. His legs weak, riding shoes without 
           traction on the cobblestone sidewalk, he approaches... 

           A GROUP OF RIDERS SITTING AT THE JUICE BAR, with Kara 
           holding court... 

                                 KARA
                        So I said, ‘Armstrong? More like 
                        Headstrong!’

           THEY BUST UP LAUGHING as Doug click-clacks his way over 
           to them. He starts laughing to try and join in the 
           revelry...just as everyone else stops.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        Doug! You made it.

           Doug nods, sitting down on a barstool. He gulps down a 
           glass of WATER, letting out a satisfied “Ahhh” before 
           slapping his hands together and looking at the SMOOTHIE 
           MENU.
                                 DOUG
                        So, what’s good today?

           ON CUE, The Bartender delivers the check and everyone 
           else STANDS TO LEAVE. For the first time, we notice the 
           row of EMPTY SMOOTHIE CUPS.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        But...I haven’t gotten anything 
                        yet.

                                 KARA
                        Doug, we waited twenty minutes for 
                        you. I’d stay, but I gotta 
                        maximize my energy booster.

                                 DOUG
                        I just figured--

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        --Here ya go, Dougie.

           Ed, the douchebag lead rider, pokes Doug in the gut with 
           the CHECK as Kara fiddles with her bike.

                                 ED
                        You know the drill, last one pays. 
                        Sorry, bud.

                                 KARA
                        Now, I know it’ll be dark soon, so 
                        I want you to be careful, ok?

           She sets a BLINKING RED CLIP-ON LIGHT in front of Doug on 
           the table and gives him a quick peck.

           THE GROUP PEDALS AWAY, as Doug sits there, stupid red 
           light blinking....

                                 WAITER (O.S.)
                        Can I take that from you, sir?

                                 DOUG
                        No!! (catches himself) Sorry. I’m 
                        actually going to order something.

           He hands it back to The Waiter.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Doug?

           Doug turns to see ELIZABETH, much more put together now 
           in a stylish fall outfit, designer sunglasses, siting at 
           an adjacent table sipping a glass of white wine.

                                 DOUG
                        Oh, hey there. Mrs...Roberts?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Elizabeth, please. You look 
                        different.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m not wearing my lab coat.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’d look pretty bizarre riding a 
                        bicycle in that outfit.

                                 DOUG
                        Don’t think it can get much more 
                        bizarre than it already is.

           She smiles at his quip while grabbing a prescription pill 
           bottle from her purse, shaking out a few, and downing 
           them with her wine. Doug’s eyes disapprove...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Eating alone?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        My husband’s meeting me.

                                 DOUG
                        Oh. I’ll just leave you-- 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --But that was supposed to happen 
                        45 minutes ago. Care to join me?

           Doug looks off, Kara and the rest of the group are all 
           but SPECKS ON THE HORIZON at this point.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - LATER

           The sun is now much lower in the sky, the short fall day 
           almost at an end. Many of the patrons have left, the 
           staff starting to break down the tables, ONLY DOUG and 
           ELIZABETH remain. EMPTY WINE BOTTLES litter the table.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        ...And you never wanted to go to 
                        medical school?

                                 DOUG
                        I did - I was - but when Kara got 
                        pregnant things changed. We got 
                        married and this just seemed like 
                        the logical choice; especially 
                        with Kara’s father owning the 
                        Pharmacy and all.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        He’s “Bishop?”

                                 DOUG
                        He is definitely Bishop.

           Doug loosens one of his riding shoes and rubs his foot..

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So you do this cycling to stay 
                        fit, or just for the cool clothes?

                                 DOUG
                        (laughing) I mostly do it because 
                        my wife tells me to, although I 
                        don’t share her passion. Still a 
                        good cardio workout--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --Can I ask you another question, 
                        Doug? Something personal.

                                 DOUG
                        Go ahead.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You always do everything your wife 
                        tells you to do?

           Doug’s smile fades. The question wouldn’t be so poignant 
           if he didn’t ask himself the same one almost everyday.

           JUST THEN, Elizabeth’s cellphone starts to RING. She 
           pulls it out, checks the caller ID, then raises an 
           eyebrow...

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.

           She gets up and walks towards the docked boats to take 
           her call. Doug moves to refill his wine glass when he is 
           startled by YELLING coming from...

           THE MARINA, where the sounds of Elizabeth ARGUING 
           FURIOUSLY on her phone have others looking as well. She 
           slams it shut and starts to stomp back towards their 
           table. Doug shifts in his seat...

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about that. 

           Hastily sifting through her bag she pulls out another 
           PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE of pills, and shakes a few out...
                                 DOUG
                        You know, I really shouldn’t be 
                        saying anything - because you seem 
                        like you’re going to be very good 
                        for business - but the pills in 
                        those orange bottles aren’t always 
                        the solution to people’s problems.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, you let me know when you 
                        find out what the solution is. 

           She pops a series of pills. Doug looks away, as if he’s 
           averting his eyes from a train wreck. THE WAITER 
           approaches...

                                 WAITER (O.S.) 
                        Here you are sir. With your lunch 
                        and drinks added on, like you 
                        requested.

           He opens up the BILLFOLD to see that the check for lunch, 
           plus what he’s consumed, totals an eye popping $257. 

           Unzipping the small pocket on his spandex shirt, he finds 
           only a crumpled 5 dollar bill and a chapstick. Then 
           slowly closes the billfold, realizing he is fucked.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Something wrong?

                                 DOUG
                        I’m a little short. 

           Elizabeth digs into her purse and pulls out her credit 
           card. She stacks the billfolds and puts her card on top 
           of them. The Waiter returns to take them...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Just put them both on my card.

                                 DOUG
                        I can’t let you do that.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Figure I owe you some money anyway 
                        for the delivery the other night. 
                        Should we call it even?

                                 DOUG
                        Almost.

           ON: DOUG’S BICYCLE STICKING OUT THE TRUNK OF A MERCEDES, 
           the little red light blinking on the back of it now.

                                 DOUG (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        I can’t tell you how much I 
                        appreciate this.
           INT. ELIZABETH’S MERCEDES - CONTINUOUS

           Doug rides shotgun, while Elizabeth drives them through 
           the picturesque town.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes you can.

                                 DOUG
                        I appreciate it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        See, I knew you could. 

           Sharing another chuckle and look, it’s easy to see they 
           like each other. The car glides to a stop at a red light.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        This has been really fun. Hanging 
                        out with you, talking...

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, it has been. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I mean, honestly, Doug. This was 
                        the first real conversation I’ve 
                        had in months. 

                                 DOUG
                        Well, I am one of those 
                        ‘authentically nice guys,’ right?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And I’m a nice girl.

                                 DOUG
                        Kindred spirits.

           There’s a LONG BEAT as they stare at one another. The 
           light has turned from RED TO GREEN, but they do not move.

                                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. REMOTE PARKING LOT - LATER

           Spandex shorts around his ankles, legs hanging out the 
           backseat of the car, Doug THRUSTS AWAY ON TOP OF 
           ELIZABETH as she moans in ecstacy...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Doug never would have wanted this 
                        for himself. The very word, 
                        adulterer, made him sweat. But, 
                        let’s face it, a guy like Doug is 
                        not about to turn down a hot piece 
                        of ass like Elizabeth.
           EXT. DOUG’S HOUSE - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

           He retrieves his bike and slams the trunk shut. He 
           glances at the house - nobody in sight, Ethan’s WINDOWS 
           PAINTED BLACK - then sticks his head in the window and 
           gives Elizabeth a quick kiss.

                                 DOUG
                        So...what happens now?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m not really sure. This isn’t 
                        something I normally engage in. 

                                 DOUG
                        Right, sorry. I wasn’t suggesting 
                        that you--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --But, I think, maybe you go 
                        inside to your wife and I go home 
                        to my husband.

                                 DOUG
                        Right. Of course. So, I’ll just, 
                        uh, see you around?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Okay, then. Good night.

           She smiles and pulls away, tail lights disappearing into 
           the night.

                                 DOUG
                        “I’ll just see you around?” Idiot.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Still in his day-glo Spandex and clip-in shoes, Doug 
           walks in to see Kara. Freshly showered and dressed in a 
           nice looking cocktail dress, she’s finishing her makeup.

                                 KARA
                        Jesus Christ, Doug. Where the hell 
                        have you been?!

                                 DOUG
                        At the Marina. Where you left me.

                                 KARA
                        That was hours ago. What the hell 
                        have you been doing?

           Doug stammers for a second...
                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        Never mind, I don’t care. Please, 
                        just go shower. We’re supposed to 
                        meet Dad and Bree in 20 minutes. 

           Desperately wanting to wash the sex off of himself, Doug 
           doesn’t stop, and keeps moving off screen.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        And see if your son is going to 
                        join us!

           He click-clacks off in his riding shoes.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Trudging up the stairs, Doug makes his way to Ethan’s 
           door. MUSIC BLARES from inside, he knocks...

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, Ethan. You going to join us 
                        for dinner?

           Remarkably, the music is turned up even louder. Doug 
           shrugs and walks away...

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           SITTING IN THE TUB, Doug lets the hot water from the 
           shower head rain down on him. Still a bit buzzed from the 
           wine and sex, it’s relaxing. His mind bounces between 
           images of:

           - Elizabeth in her nightgown at the door, her erect 
           nipples...

           - Elizabeth laughing and caressing his arm playfully at 
           the Marina Cafe...

           - Elizabeth’s touch. Her nails scraping in his back. Her 
           moaning with ecstacy as they have sex...

           BANG, BANG, BANG...he is snapped out of it by KNOCKING ON 
           THE DOOR.

                                 KARA (O.S.)
                        Doug! Seriously!

                                                                   CUT TO:

           ECU on an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (BREE), with blonde hair and a 
           face that may have been tweaked by plastic surgery...
                                 BREE
                        Dr. Friedman - Mitchell - for 
                        being the head cardiologist here 
                        at County I’m surprised you can’t 
                        diagnose a real heart ache. I’ve 
                        worked too long and hard to become 
                        a nurse here at County General 
                        just to throw it all away now.  
                        But, but I love you...and I’ll do 
                        whatever it takes to keep you.

           She holds for a beat, then popping out of character...

                                 BREE (CONT’D)
                        Then we kiss.

                                 WALTER (O.S.)
                        Super, babe. Just super.

           Walter CLAPS WILDLY, cheering on his second wife, an 
           aspiring actress who’s biggest role thus far has been in 
           a commercial for Fabric Softener. Reveal we’re...

           INT. LUM CHINS RESTAURANT - EVENING

           An UPSCALE suburban Chinese Food Restaurant that does 
           good business. They eat dim-sum style...

                                 BREE
                        Oh, knock it off Wally.

           Bree lets out a HORRIBLE LAUGH. From the way Kara 
           polishes off her glass of wine, we get the feeling she’s 
           not too fond of Bree. She wiggles the empty bottle at the 
           waiter as a signal they need another one pronto...

                                 KARA
                        That was great. Wasn’t that great, 
                        Doug? Doug!?

           Daydreaming, about you-know-who, he snaps to...

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, just great. So what happens 
                        now, Bree? They “call you back,” 
                        right?

                                 BREE
                        Only if you get the part.

                                 DOUG
                        Did they call?

                                 BREE
                        Not yet.
                                 WALTER
                        So, Doug. Everything okay down at 
                        the store?

                                 DOUG
                        Tip top.

                                 WALTER
                        Great. That means we can talk 
                        about Ethan.

                                 DOUG
                        (you told him) Kara.

                                 KARA
                        He’s just concerned, Doug.

                                 WALTER
                        I am. He’s at a pivotal age, this 
                        is where things get all fucked if 
                        you don’t keep ‘em in check.

                                 DOUG
                        “Keep ‘em in check?” What is that 
                        even supposed to mean, Walter?

                                 KARA
                        I think what dad is trying to say, 
                        is that we all need to look out 
                        for Ethan right now.

                                 WALTER
                        That’s why I was going to suggest 
                        he come stay with us a few nights 
                        a week.

                                 DOUG
                        That’s ridiculous!

                                 WALTER
                        A change of scenery, along with 
                        another male influence, might do 
                        the boy some good.

                                 DOUG
                        Are you suggesting that I’m an 
                        inadequate role model?

                                 WALTER
                        Not really suggesting anything.

                                 KARA
                        Dad, Why!? Everytime! We can’t 
                        just sit down and enjoy a meal...
           Walter and Kara argue in the background. Bree 
           accidentally drops a dumpling from her chopsticks into 
           her glass of wine...then plucks it out and eats it. Doug 
           stares out the window...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Walter Bishop was an arrogant 
                        prick, no doubt. But perhaps Doug 
                        had let Ethan down? If you don’t 
                        respect yourself, you can’t expect 
                        anyone else to respect you either.

           EXT. WOODBURY MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

           We recognize the building from earlier in the film. 
           American Flag whips against the pole out front, as 
           parents drop off their kids...

           INT. WOODBURY MIDDLE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Doug and Kara sit in chairs waiting inside the school’s 
           MAIN OFFICE.

                        Mr. and Mrs. Varney...

           INT. WOODBURY MIDDLE SCHOOL - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Standing in front of a large oak desk is a masculine 
           looking woman of about 40. Crew cut, pants suit, little 
           make up, FRAMED PHOTO on her desk of her embracing a 
           SUPER BUTCH DYKE at “Lilith Fair ‘06.” Her name plate 
           reads PRINCIPAL SUSAN SAMMS-CARMICHAEL.

           Flanking her is a thin man in his 30’s, DR. ADAM ROTH. An 
           underpaid, overqualified school psychologist. 

                                 PRINCIPAL SAMMS-CARMICHAEL
                        Thank you both for coming in.

                                 KARA
                        Well, your message--

                                 PRINCIPAL SAMMS-CARMICHAEL
                        --was alarming, I’m sure. But 
                        we’re all here to help work 
                        through this the best way 
                        possible.

                                 KARA
                        So maybe you could tell us why 
                        we’re here then.
                                 DR. ROTH
                        Has Ethan been acting out at all, 
                        at home? Tantrums, bouts of sudden 
                        anger or rage.

                                 DOUG
                        He keeps to himself, mostly. A 
                        pretty quiet kid. I was like that--

                                 KARA
                        --They don’t care what you were 
                        like, Doug. This is about Ethan.

                                 DR. ROTH
                        No, this is good. Any family 
                        history of behavior or mental 
                        illness--

                        --Mental illness? Can you please 
                        just tell me what this is all 
                        about already!?

           The principal looks at Dr. Roth - okay, I’ll tell them.

                                 PRINCIPAL SAMMS-CARMICHAEL
                        It was brought to my attention 
                        that last week, while he should’ve 
                        been in Life Science, Ethan was 
                        discovered by one of our faculty 
                        members in the boys locker room 
                        vandalizing one of the lockers 
                        with, um--

                                 DR. ROTH
                        --Excrement.

           Kara goes white. Doug does his best not to seem slightly 
           amused by this, hiding a little smile.

                                 PRINCIPAL SAMMS-CARMICHAEL
                        And this wasn’t the first time. 
                        Substantial pieces of, uh--

                        school for the past 2 months. 
                        There’s no way of connecting Ethan 
                        to the other leavings, but--

                        --Then maybe you need to look 
                        elsewhere. Like that David Chen

                        those fireworks on the class trip 
                        to the Six Flags. Hmm? Seems

                        toting explosives on a field trip 
                        would also take a dump in a

                        We’ve been keeping a close eye on 
                        Ethan. Like your husband said, he 
                        does keep to himself and appears 
                        to get on just fine with the other 
                        students. At the surface 
                        everything seems tranquil, which 
                        is often misleading.

                        I’m going to be sick.

                                 DR. ROTH
                        Mrs. Varney. While extreme and 
                        unsanitary, this is nothing more 
                        than a young boy crying out for 
                        attention. A person committing an 
                        act such as this wants to get 
                        caught.

                                 KARA
                        I’m sorry, who are you again?

           Dr. Roth looks hurt, he’s clearly been through this...

                                 DR. ROTH
                        Doctor Roth. The school’s 
                        psychologist.

                                 KARA
                        And your degree comes from which 
                        of our fine online universities?

                                 DOUG
                        Honey, please.
                                 KARA
                        I’m sorry. But these are serious 
                        accusations being made by 
                        strangers with very little in the 
                        way of evidence.

                                 DR. ROTH
                        If it’s all right with you, I’d 
                        like to start seeing Ethan twice a 
                        week. Just to check in, nothing 
                        too formal. Mostly just to get a 
                        better idea of who he is and 
                        what’s going on, and head off any 
                        trouble at the pass.

                                 KARA
                        We’ll think about it.

           Kara gets up and storms out. Doug sits there, still 
           soaking it all in...

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - LATER

           Doug is going through the motions, putting together a 
           prescription...then stops. He leans on the counter, the 
           weight of everything he’s heard from the morning hitting 
           him like a ton of bricks.

           THE DOOR CHIME JINGLES, causing him to look up INTO THE 
           BUBBLED SECURITY MIRROR and spot WALTER walking in.

                                 DOUG
                        (to himself) Fuck.

           After giving Noah a zesty, firm handshake...

                                 WALTER
                        Doug. Can I get a moment?

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - COUNTER AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           They find a bit of privacy between two of the GIANT 
           SHELVES, each filled with prescription bags. Walter takes 
           it upon himself to inspect an order...

                                 WALTER
                        Betty Cavendish. Been on birth 
                        control for 25 years, yet has 
                        lived alone with her cats for the 
                        same period of time. Crazy world.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m a little busy, Walter. What 
                        did you need?
                                 WALTER
                        Yes. Right. Anyhow, it’s, um, 
                        about the other night, at dinner. 
                        I said some things...and, well, I 
                        wanted to say--

                                 DOUG
                        --Water under the bridge.

           Walter looks relieved that he didn’t actually have to use 
           the word “sorry.” Letting out a big sigh...

                                 WALTER
                        Great! Glad we settled that. 
                        (then) So, how’s it been so far.

           Walter leads him back out to...

           THE FRONT COUNTER AREA, inspecting things as he goes.

                                 DOUG
                        You know, still ironing out a few 
                        kinks but settling in. Just not 
                        enough hours in the day sometimes.

                                 WALTER
                        So, close early.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m sorry?

                                 WALTER
                        You own the store. Not CVS or Rite 
                        Aid. Thus, you make the hours. If 
                        you need to close early now and 
                        then, it’s no big deal. Call it 
                        one of the perks.

                                 DOUG
                        Seriously?

                                 WALTER
                        Sure. Used to do it all the time 
                        if we had a big snow on the way, 
                        wanted to squeeze in a quick 9 
                        holes, or had too many black kids 
                        on the floor. Know what I mean.

           He pats him on the shoulder as he makes his way out.

           THE DOOR CHIME JINGLES AGAIN and in steps ETHAN, along 
           with a few other disaffected pre-teens...

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        There he is!
           Walter rushes up to Ethan, tussling his hair and 
           pretending to wrestle with him. Or, the exact opposite of 
           what Ethan wants to have done to him.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Handsome guy like you running 
                        around after school. Where’s your 
                        girlfriend at?

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t have a girlfriend.

                                 WALTER
                        Well, if ya take after your 
                        Grandpa, won’t be long ‘til they 
                        catch wind of that Pepsi bottle 
                        dangling between your legs! Heyo!

           This sends Walter into hysterics. Ethan is mortified, as 
           is Doug.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        I gotta get going. You take care, 
                        champ. And Doug, don’t forget what 
                        we talked about...

           He nods at A NICE BLACK COUPLE buying diapers on his way 
           out.

           Ethan grabs a MAXIM magazine off the shelf. Doug cranes 
           his neck, nodding at the BUSTY BLONDE on the cover.

                                 DOUG
                        Not bad. Her tits.

           Ethan puts the magazine back on the shelf, and grabs GUNS 
           & AMMO. Alarmed, Doug takes it away and puts it right 
           back on the shelf.

                                 ETHAN
                        I saw you and Mom at school today.

                                 DOUG
                        We had a little meeting with some 
                        of your teachers. 

                                 ETHAN
                        About what?

                                 DOUG
                        Nothing major. Just some 
                        Parent/Teacher stuff. Bor-ing.

           Ethan plucks another magazine off the rack, but Doug puts 
           his hand on his shoulder, prepping for a heart-to-heart.
                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        You know, if there’s ever anything 
                        you want to tell me...or just want 
                        to talk. I’m all ears.

                                 ETHAN
                        This a sex thing?

                                 DOUG
                        It’s not a sex thing.

           After an awkward beat, Doug smooths out his own lab coat.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        I gotta get back to work, but I’ll 
                        catch you later pal.

           Spinning on his heel, Doug heads back up towards the 
           Counter Area feeling a little better...but inadvertently 
           knocks over that pesky DR. SCHOLLS DISPLAY.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Shit. Hey, Noah. Noah! 

           But Noah does not respond. He’s too busy pretending a 
           tube of WRAPPING PAPER is his penis, going between 
           jerking it off and fucking a shelf as a cluster of 
           TEENAGE BURNOUTS crack up.

           Doug kneels down to pick up the bottles of athletes foot 
           powder. Looking up, he catches a GLIMPSE OF ETHAN in the 
           SECURITY MIRROR, shoving the Magazine in his jacket.

           Craning his neck around the corner, still hidden from 
           view, Doug watches as ETHAN PROCEEDS TO SHOPLIFT a 
           variety of items. Nail clippers, water balloons and, 
           finally, a LARGE BOX OF LAXATIVES. Then, looking both 
           ways, he slips out the front door.

           Doug turns to see JANET WATCHING HIM catch his son 
           shoplifting and do nothing. 

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        What!?

           Janet snaps out of her astonishment, and says...

                                 JANET 
                        There’s a phone call for you.

                                 DOUG
                        Take a message.

                                 JANET
                        Sounds important. 

                                 DOUG
                        Take. A. Message.
           The clock reads 5:45. Doug can’t bear another hour plus 
           of work. Heeding his father-in-law’s advice...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Then lock up. We’re closing early.

                                 JANET
                        Why?

                                 DOUG
                        You want to go home or not!?

           She perks up instantly and hops into action.

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - LATER

           Doug is cleaning up his area, putting things away when 
           the DOOR CHIME JINGLES.  He hears Janet up front...

                                 JANET
                        I’m sorry Miss, but we’re closed.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Says here you don’t close ‘til 7.

           Doug recognizes the voice and cranes his neck to spot 
           ELIZABETH...his eyes go wide.

                                 DOUG
                        Janet! Hold on, wait! Wait!

           LEAPING OVER THE COUNTER AND RUNNING TO THE DOOR...

                                 JANET
                        But, you said to lock up--

                                 DOUG
                        --I know what I said. But I think 
                        we can help one more customer.

                                 JANET
                        You also said I could go. Bye.

           Janet pushes out between them, the door shuts behind her.

                                 DOUG
                        Nice to see you again.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes, you too. But, if you’re 
                        closing early then--

                                 DOUG
                        --No, no. What can I do for you?

           She reaches into her purse and pulls out TWO 
           PRESCRIPTIONS, rubbing them together and smiling.
           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - LATER

           Doug works at his station putting together the order, 
           when Liz approaches carrying a basket full of other items 
           she gathered from around the store.

                                 DOUG
                        Find everything okay?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes. But, actually, I’m struggling 
                        with something, Doug.

                                 DOUG
                        I know. Me too.

           He stops what he’s doing to lean over the counter towards 
           her, expecting her to address THE PINK ELEPHANT in the 
           room, when Elizabeth reveals that she’s holding a SMALL 
           CERAMIC FIGURINE in each hand.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m struggling between the ‘fawn 
                        eating shrubs,’ and the ‘drunk 
                        chimney sweep.’ Big decision.

                                 DOUG
                        Oh. Right. That is a tough one. 
                        But, if pressed, I’d go with the 
                        fawn. That way you could 
                        ultimately complete the set 
                        with...

           Doug reaches into the nearby DISPLAY CASE, pulling...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        The triumphant buck. And the 
                        farmer gnome.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Then it’s settled.

           Putting the ceramic fawn in her basket they share a 
           laugh, and A MOMENT...but it is interrupted when they 
           feel eyes on them. NOAH’S.

                                 NOAH
                        The douches came in.

           He stands there holding a BIG BOX OF DOUCHES.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, that certainly sounds like 
                        good news to me.

                                 DOUG
                        Thank you, Noah.
                                 NOAH
                        Where’s Janet?

                                 DOUG
                        Told her she could leave early. 
                        Why don’t you do the same.

                                 NOAH
                        No shit?

                                 DOUG
                        Good night, Noah.

           Thrilled to pieces, Noah turns on a dime, sheds his 
           “Bishop’s” windbreaker, and is out the door. 

           The BELL JINGLES, signaling his exit. A beat passes as 
           Elizabeth and Doug stand there, alone now in the store.

                                 ELIZABETH (PRE-LAP)
                        C’mon. You can’t tell me you 
                        aren’t fascinated by all 
                        these...“controlled substances.” 

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - COUNTER AREA - LATER

           Doug is now hard at work in his lab area to fulfil 
           Elizabeth’s new prescriptions, while she leans on the 
           counter watching him work.

                                 DOUG
                        Chemistry has always fascinated 
                        me, but I guess it’s the same 
                        feeling Bank Tellers have about 
                        hundred dollar bills. You’re 
                        around them long enough, after a 
                        while it’s just green paper.

           He is good at his job. Moving confidently between the 
           various mixing agents, rapidly counting off pills, 
           printing the labels and slapping them on the bottles. She 
           is impressed...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Think about it. By ingesting 
                        something the size of a bread 
                        crumb you can immediately help 
                        yourself overcome anxiety, 
                        depression, distraction. Be swept 
                        away into an artificially 
                        maintained sense of bliss. Or made 
                        more assertive, docile, erect. 

                                 DOUG
                        I am interested. It’s my business 
                        to be. But, I never--
                                 ELIZABETH
                        --Get high on your own supply?

                                 DOUG
                        That’s illegal.

           Elizabeth has opened a small bag of peanut M&M’s, rolling 
           one around in her mouth...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Of course it is, but it must be 
                        hard working in the candy shop all 
                        day. Knowing that most any problem 
                        that arises could be solved by any 
                        one of your apothecaries.

                                 DOUG
                        I’ve been fortunate enough not to 
                        have to take any medication for--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --Being crazy. Like me.

                                 DOUG
                        That’s not what I was going to 
                        say. And you’re not crazy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        My husband might disagree with 
                        you.

                                 DOUG
                        Come on. You’re beautiful, smart, 
                        worldly--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --I dropped out of UConn after 3 
                        semesters. And I’m ‘worldly’ if 
                        you consider the world to be three 
                        investment banking conventions in 
                        St. Lucia. We ate Ruth’s Chris 
                        every night--

                                 DOUG
                        --Great onion rings-- 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --All I have going for me is a 
                        rich husband, Doug. Other than 
                        that it’s just a list of things I 
                        want to do and places I want to 
                        see, a mile long.

                                 DOUG
                        Well, you can argue me on smart 
                        and worldly, but I think you’re 
                        beautiful and there’s nothing you 
                        can say that will change my mind.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Are you saying all this because 
                        you mean it, or because you want 
                        to sleep with me again?

           Startled by this, Doug knocks over a jar of swabs...

                                 DOUG
                        That was a mistake.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Complimenting me or--

                                 DOUG
                        --We both got swept up in the 
                        moment, it was very nice, but I 
                        have a family and you have a 
                        husband. Both would be very upset 
                        to lose us.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Fine. You’re right. It was a big 
                        mistake. Let’s just put it behind 
                        us and move on. Like adults.

                                 DOUG
                        As friends. I’m good at friends.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Okay, then. Adult friends.

           There’s a dash of disappointment in Doug’s face, but he’s 
           not about to argue. Doug hands her the bag...her 
           manicured fingers draping over his, as she takes it from 
           him. Their eyes meet...

                                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           DOUG AND LIZ kissing and peeling each other’s clothing 
           off with great urgency.

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - MOMENTS LATER

           They move from the counter area towards the aisles, 
           ultimately falling to the ground, and slink OUT OF VIEW. 
           However, the breathing and kissing sounds are vivid.

           ON THE GROUND, she fumbles with her prescription bags, 
           grabbing a pill bottle and shoving it in Doug’s mouth.

                                 DOUG
                        What is that?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Jack’s Viagra.
                                 DOUG
                        But, I don’t need...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        (mischievous) I know.

           They slink out of frame...DOUG’S HAND reaches back into 
           frame grabbing a BOX OF MAGNUM CONDOMS off the rack next 
           to them. AN EXTENDED BEAT LATER, Liz’s hand reaches into 
           frame and grabs the REGULAR SIZE CONDOMS.

           THE PORCELAIN FIGURINES - gnomes, milk maids, etc - all 
           look on. Their little faces registering shock and joy.

                                                            FADE TO BLACK:

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Doug did not feel guilty about 
                        engaging in an extra-marital 
                        affair. Nor the sneaking around or 
                        the depraved sexual acts. He felt 
                        guilty because he was getting away 
                        with it so easily...

                                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           DOUG AND ELIZABETH ARE SWEPT INTO THEIR AFFAIR...

           - In the back of Doug’s Prius. She puts pills in both 
           their mouths. What exactly, we’re not sure...

           - They have sex on a rug in front of the HUGE FIREPLACE 
           in Elizabeth’s mansion. The German Shepherds watch.

           - In a RAMADA INN, tangled in the sheets having a 
           “picnic” comprised of pills and whatever can be purchased 
           from a hallway vending machine, laughing as they watch 
           THE JERK on television.

           - Elizabeth hands him a NORDSTROMS BAG, from which Doug 
           pulls a shirt, ties, clothing much more fashionable than 
           he’s used to...he’s touched.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And as the sex became more 
                        frequent and experimental...

           - Doug is blindfolded, small droplets of hot wax being 
           sprinkled over his bare chest...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        So did the drug use.
           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - LATE NIGHT

           IN A QUICK SUCCESSION OF SHOTS, we watch Doug grab the 
           ANTIQUE PHARMACY TOOLS and go to work at his mixing 
           station. He CRUSHES tablets in the mortar & pestle.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Doug’s extensive knowledge of 
                        pharmaceuticals and the chemistry 
                        within were being stretched in 
                        ways he never imagined...

           Using a liquid mixing agent, he re-forms the powders into 
           a thick syrupy liquid, then delicately pours it into what 
           looks like a TINY MUFFIN TRAY that’s used to shape pills.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        20 milligrams of Viagra, blended 
                        with 40 milligrams of Ritalin 
                        allowed for intensely focused and 
                        elongated rounds of sex.

           IN THE HOTEL ROOM BED - they go at it with the methodical 
           stamina of Kenyan Marathoners. Doug squirts water into 
           his mouth from his biking water bottle, without stopping.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        15 milligrams of Percocet, 4 
                        milligrams of Xanax, with a dash 
                        of amobarbital made for an almost 
                        euphoric state of openness.

           ON A BLANKET, laid out on the far side of the lake, they 
           lay face-to-face...in awe of one another. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And, of course, Doug’s favorite. 
                        The kitchen sink wild card.

           Doug sweeps together the various CHIPS AND FLAKES of 
           whatever was left lying around on the counter, merging 
           them together into one LARGE RAINBOW-FLECKED PILL.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (CONT’D)
                        A blend that inspired Doug to 
                        spend his lunch breaks elsewhere.

           EXT. WOODBURY STREETS - AFTERNOON

           High as a fucking kite, Doug rides along on his bike - 
           still in slacks and lab coat - marveling at the sun 
           splintering through trees, the birds, etc. He’s just out 
           for enjoyment rather than being forced by his wife.
                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        He created a smorgasbord of new 
                        psychotropic, psychotherapeutic, 
                        and narcotic drugs. Doug was 
                        nervous at first, but Elizabeth 
                        filled him with confidence and 
                        love, and he trusted her 
                        completely. 

           She even crushes up a few and encourages him to SNIFF THE 
           POWDER which, of course, he does.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This new relationship made him 
                        feel special again...

           They then collapse back onto the couch in a loving 
           embrace, staring into each others dilated pupils...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The pills made him feel everything 
                        else. Euphoric, aggressive, care-
                        free...whatever the moment 
                        required...that anything was 
                        possible. And that the solution to 
                        his problems and the gateway to 
                        instant bliss had in fact been 
                        around him all this time.

           BACK IN THE PHARMACY, Doug turns from his station to find 
           that, instead of jars, the pills are now brimming out of 
           PLEXIGLASS BINS. Using a scooper, Doug skips between bins 
           like a SCHOOL GIRL, filling up a white bag...it’s a CANDY 
           SHOP. 

           IN REALITY, Doug is sorting out a prescription and 
           “accidentally” swipes an extra two pills to the 
           ground...placing his loafer on top of them and sweeping 
           them aside.

           Doug even plucks the staples out to open a WHITE BAG 
           holding a completed prescription, and shakes out two 
           pills, before closing it back up.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Doug had found better living 
                        through chemistry, and once again 
                        believed that anything was 
                        possible. He was no longer 
                        restricted in the distance with 
                        which he could move. He was more 
                        than a Bishop, he was a King.

           EXT. GLEN ROCK SHOPPING CENTER - DAY

           Doug’s Prius pulls into the PARKING LOT and cruises the 
           aisles until he locates a space.
                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        But, while their feelings for one 
                        another continued to grow, the 
                        effects of the apothecaries were 
                        only temporary. And reality 
                        beckoned.

           The score that fueled this segment bleeds into TERRIBLE 
           HOUSE MUSIC as Doug comes to a stop RIGHT OUTSIDE OF...

           INT. WHEELS ON FIRE - CONTINUOUS

           Kara’s SPINNING STUDIO, where she leads a class in 
           session. Dripping in sweat, wild eyed, she ‘motivates’ 
           her class by shouting commands over the PA SPEAKERS on 
           her headset.

           Doug enters and works his way up the side of the room, 
           until he’s next to Kara at the front. The entire wall 
           next to her is FILLED with her Tour de Woodbury trophies. 

                                 KARA
                        Doug, I’m in a class.

           HER VOICE BOOMS OVER THE SPEAKERS, her students look a 
           bit confused, craning their necks to see...

                                 DOUG
                        I need to talk to you.

                                 KARA
                        Can it wait? We’ve got one more 
                        big hill then the cool down. Let’s 
                        go you lazy hausfraus! Pick it up!

           Judging by their exhausted looks, we get the feeling that 
           even her spinning students are getting tired of Kara too. 
           ED, the dickhead from their riding group, is the only one 
           who finds her entertaining.

                                 DOUG
                        No, it can’t...

           He reaches out and CLICKS OFF HER MIC, prompting a DEATH 
           STARE FROM KARA...

                                 KARA
                        What are you doing!?

                                 DOUG
                        Dr. Roth called me. Apparently 
                        Ethan didn’t show up for his 
                        appointment today with him.

                                 KARA
                        Not surprising.
                                 DOUG
                        What are we gonna do about him?

                                 KARA
                        We? No. What are you going to do 
                        about him?

                                 DOUG
                        The hell is that supposed to mean--

                                 KARA
                        --It means I’ve tried, and he’s 
                        your son too. So, be his father, 
                        and do something. 

           Kara FLIPS BACK ON HER HEADSET...

                                 DOUG
                        What do you expect me to do?

                                 KARA
                        (over the PA) It’s called being a 
                        man, Doug. Give it a try. Who 
                        knows, you might actually like it.

           That stung. Ed tries to stifle his laugh, as the entire 
           class of women on stationary bikes now stare at Doug...

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM

           Doug and Elizabeth are tangled in the sheets in a brief 
           intermission from their sexcapades. Elizabeth comes 
           closer, ready for more...but Doug pulls away. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What is it? 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m sorry, I’m just not...I don’t 
                        know.

           She instinctively sifts through the cache of pill bottles 
           until she hits THE VIAGRA, shaking out one, but Doug 
           stops her.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        No. It’s not that...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Okay. I’ve got that desoxyn-
                        thingie you made, which was great. 
                        Ooh, or maybe even some Ambien. We 
                        keep each other up and trip out--

                                 DOUG
                        --It’s my wife.
           As Elizabeth stops fumbling through her bottles...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Does she know?

                                 DOUG
                        No. Not at all...but I almost want 
                        her to. So she can see how happy I 
                        am. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m happy, too.

                                 DOUG
                        And also so she can see all the 
                        sex stuff we’re doing. Like that 
                        thing you did on top...?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You mean reverse cowgirl.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, that. That was something. 
                        I’d never seen that before.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Don’t watch a lot of porn, do you?

                                 DOUG
                        Kara busted me one time, ya know 
                        (mimes jerking off). So she put a 
                        parental lock on my laptop.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?

                                 DOUG
                        She has this code on the computer 
                        now...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Jesus-fucking-Christ, Doug!

                                 DOUG
                        What? Why are you yelling at me?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Because I don’t understand why a 
                        guy like you puts up with shit 
                        like that. You deserve more.

                                 DOUG
                        Sure, maybe. But what am I going 
                        to do about it--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --Leave.
           Doug doesn’t respond...he’s obviously thought about this 
           too.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Both of us. Just leave. It would 
                        be great, wouldn’t it? Pick up on 
                        a whim and just go somewhere 
                        together, maybe the tropics--

                                 DOUG
                        --I burn easily.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        OK, then Europe. Australia. 
                        Kathmandu. Wherever! Get out of 
                        here and see the world. Just 
                        imagine, hitting the reset button, 
                        getting a do-over, making a new 
                        life with someone great...

           Doug takes a deep breath. Treading into serious waters.

                                 DOUG
                        I can’t. Kara would bleed me dry, 
                        and I’m sure you signed a pre-nup.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I did. And it doesn’t give me much 
                        of anything in a divorce. The pre-
                        nup is just a small reminder of 
                        what I am: a trophy wife. We don’t 
                        age gracefully and die holding our 
                        husband’s hand in the rest home. 
                        We get replaced.

                                 DOUG
                        Well, what if we made you a widow?

           A beat. It just hangs there...then Elizabeth BURSTS OUT 
           INTO CACKLING LAUGHTER. Doug keeps a serious look just a 
           beat longer and then ERUPTS IN GIGGLES, too. They are on 
           a variety of mood-altering drugs, after all...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you could get the dogs to 
                        eat him!?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        If I really wanted to kill him, 
                        I’d just gain a hundred pounds.

                                 DOUG
                        (laughing) No. If you really
                        wanted to kill him, you’d mess 
                        with his heart arrhythmia...

           And he tails off, as though some invisible line has been 
           crossed.
                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        I was joking--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know you were, honey. I was, 
                        too. But...you’re right. His heart 
                        is a problem. Has been forever. 
                        But you know that already, Mr. 
                        Pharmacist. Half his pills are 
                        just to keep the damn thing 
                        ticking. And those meds could keep 
                        him going for another twenty 
                        years. Twenty years of cocktail 
                        parties, fund raising dinners, 
                        golf tournaments. I hate golf.

           She sits up and takes his face in her hands...

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Which is why sometimes I like to 
                        imagine you, me, and more thousand 
                        dollar bills than we know what to 
                        do with.

           She cradles and caresses his face, lovingly. Doug is deep 
           in thought, but bewitched by her touch...

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        It adds a little excitement to my 
                        life...like when I think about how 
                        I’m falling for you.

                                 DOUG
                        I love you, too.

           She grins and softly touches his face... 

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        But I should tell you, there 
                        actually aren’t any more thousand 
                        dollar bills. Too easy to 
                        counterfeit. In fact, the hundred 
                        dollar bill is the largest one 
                        still in circulation--

           He’s cut off by Elizabeth’s hand COVERING HIS MOUTH.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Honey, sometimes you gotta know 
                        when to shut up and just give it 
                        to a girl. Now being one of those 
                        times.

           Doug wraps his arms around her, rolling over on top as...

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           A GRUMPY OLD MAN’S FACE (MR. AANENSON)...
                                 MR. AANENSON
                        It’s not like nothing is coming 
                        out. I’m not constipated, 
                        understand. My stool, it’s just 
                        not...substantial.  

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - EVENING

           AT THE COUNTER, Doug is helping him select the right 
           product. He is distant, still mulling Elizabeth’s 
           proposition, and clearly not paying much attention.

                                 MR. AANENSON (O.S.)
                        Varney?!

                                 DOUG
                        Yes. What?

           Mr. Aanenson slaps TWO BOXES of LAXATIVES down on the 
           counter. One of them registers with Doug as ETHAN’S BRAND 
           OF CHOICE, and he fixates on it...

                                 MR. AANENSON
                        You gonna help me out or what?

                                 DOUG
                        Sorry? With what?

                                 MR. AANENSON
                        My shit.

                                 DOUG
                        Right. Sorry. These are both 
                        fairly aggressive stool softeners. 
                        Either one will do the job.

                                 MR. AANENSON
                        I went through two Readers Digests 
                        the other day and all I got were 
                        these small pellets. Like the kind 
                        I put in the bottom of my fish 
                        tank.

                                 DOUG
                        One serving in the morning and 
                        another at night, and I’m sure 
                        your next movement will be 
                        markedly more satisfying.

           Doug puts the laxatives in a brown bag and Mr. Aanenson 
           swipes it off the counter...upon which Doug rests his 
           head after he walks away. Still with his head down.

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        Doug?
                                 DOUG
                        Just a minute, Janet.

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        But, there’s this guy here--

                                 DOUG
                        --Dammit, Janet, in a minute! 

                                 JANET 
                        Jesus, what’s gotten into you?

           Unused to such outbursts, Janet spins and takes off in a 
           huff. A MEEK LOOKING man in his 30’s, dressed in an off-
           the-rack suit from JC Penney stands there...

                                 MAN 
                        Are you (reading off pad) Douglas 
                        Varney?

                                 DOUG
                        Yes.

                                 MAN
                        And you’re the owner of this 
                        establishment?

                                 DOUG
                        Yes.

                                 MAN
                        Then how come it’s called 
                        “Bishop’s?”

                                 DOUG
                        Did you need a consultation or...?

                                 MAN
                        Oh, right, of course. Here I am 
                        running my big mouth, asking all 
                        these questions, and I haven’t 
                        even introduced myself...

           He hands Doug a business card from his wallet. ANDREW 
           CARP, Field Agent, Drug Enforcement Agency.

                                 CARP
                        I’m Special Agent Andrew Carp, 
                        from the DEA field office down in 
                        New Haven.

           Doug looks at Janet, like “What the fuck?”

                                 JANET
                        (snotty) Doug, there’s a gentleman 
                        here to see you from the DEA.

           She shoots Doug a told-ya-so look before storming off.
           As Carp replaces his wallet, Doug sees that he also 
           CARRIES A GUN...and immediately snaps from his fog.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        I’ve tried calling - a few times 
                        actually - you’re a tough man to 
                        get on the phone, Mr. Varney.

                                 DOUG
                        Oh, yeah, well...we’ve been busy. 
                        Cold and flu season, ya know.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        According to our records Bishop’s 
                        Pharmacy recently changed owners 
                        but no paperwork has been filed. 

                                 DOUG
                        How does that concern the Drug 
                        Enforcement Agency. I report to--

                                 AGENT CARP
                        --the Board of Pharmacies, I know. 
                        But when there’s a change of 
                        ownership, they call us. Protocol. 

                                 DOUG
                        Shouldn’t you be wearing a 
                        windbreaker and cool sunglasses, 
                        smashing down doors looking for 
                        bricks of uncut heroin?

                                 AGENT CARP
                        What most people don’t realize, 
                        Mr. Varney, is that the 
                        misallocation of prescription 
                        medication kills just as many 
                        people, if not more, as any of the 
                        glamour drugs.

                                 DOUG
                        Glamour drugs?

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Coke, crack, smack, E, p-dog...

                                 DOUG
                        P-dog?

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Yeah, it’s kinda like “Sherm.” In 
                        any event, the change of 
                        ownership... 

                                 DOUG
                        Damn. That’s right. I’m sorry. 
                        See, I just took over for my 
                        father-in-law not too long ago--
                                 AGENT CARP
                        --October 3rd. 

                                 DOUG
                        Right. And, well, I’m a little 
                        overwhelmed. He was - is - a bit 
                        of a control freak and didn’t let 
                        me handle much around here so I’m 
                        still trying to get a handle on 
                        things. 

                                 AGENT CARP
                        I understand. My father-in-law’s 
                        the same way. Nevertheless, I’m 
                        still going to need a look at your 
                        inventory.

                                 DOUG
                        My inventory? Why? We’re fully 
                        stocked.

                                 CARP
                        I’m sure you are. I just have to 
                        ensure that your actual 
                        dispensation of meds matches up 
                        with the prescription records. 

                                 DOUG
                        To make sure I’m on the up and up?

                                 AGENT CARP
                        That’s right. Unless, of course, 
                        you’re some sort of no-good, 
                        thieving pill popper.

           A BEAT, as Doug’s face tightens...until Carp BURSTS OUT 
           LAUGHING.

                                 AGENT CARP (CONT’D)
                        I’m playing with ya. Again, it’s 
                        just protocol with new ownership, 
                        so if we could...

           The tiniest bead of sweat develops on Doug’s forehead. 
           He’s unsure how to play this...and he catches NOAH 
           staring at him accusatorily before slipping away.

                                 DOUG
                        Now might not be the best time. 
                        It’s just...like I said, things 
                        are just a bit busy around here, 
                        that’s all. 

           Carp looks around. The place is virtually empty.
                                 AGENT CARP
                        Little trade secret, Mr. Varney: I 
                        don’t want to be here any more 
                        than you want me to be. And, 
                        between us, you’re not exactly 
                        what we call a ‘high risk’ 
                        establishment. The old owner, your 
                        father-in-law--

                                 DOUG
                        --Walter Bishop.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Yeah, Bishop. Record’s tight as a 
                        drum. Had almost 100% match rate. 
                        Never lost track of a single pill. 
                        Must really keep things in check.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, he’s wonderful. So, that 
                        happens with other pharmacies, 
                        though? Losing pills?

                                 AGENT CARP
                        On the record, no comment. But 
                        c’mon, Mr. Varney, if our 
                        government has misplaced nuclear 
                        weapons a few pills are bound to 
                        go MIA, right? 

           He chuckles, getting a laugh out of Doug, who thinks he’s 
           in the clear. And then...

                                 AGENT CARP (CONT’D)
                        (snapping back to attention) Now 
                        really, if we could just get to 
                        it, I’ll be out of your hair in 
                        half-an-hour.

           Doug stares Carp down, then nods and lets the agent back 
           into the stock room. As Carp gets out a notepad and 
           begins to jot things down, Doug surreptitiously pops a 
           pill. 

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - GARAGE - EVENING

           Doug pulls the Prius in and kills the already silent 
           engine. Getting out he spies that KARA’S CAR IS THERE, 
           and sinks...but then notices that her BICYCLE is missing 
           off of the rack, and SMILES. Relieved.
           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Still rattled from his run-in with the law, Doug goes to 
           the freezer and pulls a frosty bottle of vodka and fixes 
           himself a drink...but is distracted by the thumping music 
           coming from upstairs. Ethan’s room.

           Doug sifts through the mail, noticing an ENVELOPE FROM 
           ETHAN’S SCHOOL. He opens and reads, keying on the terms 
           “recommendation” “psychiatric analysis” “professional 
           opinion” “potential round of medication.”

                                 DOUG
                        Fuck, Ethan. 

           He fishes around in his pocket and pulls a VARIETY OF 
           MIXED PILLS, sifting trough them until finding something 
           that will ease his tension. Then pops one, washing it 
           down with his vodka. 

           With pills still in hand he looks to the counter and 
           notices something...RACK FOCUS, to a SMALL BOTTLE OF 
           STRAWBERRY QUIK that Ethan loves so much.

           Considering the pills in his hand, then Ethan’s drink. 
           The music from upstairs growing more intense...Doug lets 
           the pills in his hand clatter to the counter, then 
           reaches for a ROLLING PIN.

           INT. ETHAN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           THE MUSIC BLARES, as Doug knocks/pushes the door open, 
           and turns down the stereo. 

                                 DOUG
                        A little loud, don’t you think?

                                 ETHAN
                        You’re supposed to listen to 
                        Mastodon loud.

                                 DOUG
                        Of course. Mastodon.

           Doug tries his best to be casual, handing the bottle of 
           Quik to his son, then checks out the crap on his shelves.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Here. Brought you a snack.

                                 ETHAN
                        Thanks.

                                 DOUG
                        (over his shoulder) So how are 
                        things at school?
                                 ETHAN
                        Okay, I guess.

                                 DOUG
                        Right. Any idea why they might’ve 
                        suspended you then?

           Ethan shakes the Quik, getting ready to open it.

                                 ETHAN
                        I...they just don’t...I mean that 
                        Dr. Roth guy. He’s such a dick.

           At the end of the shelf, Doug sees a FRAMED PHOTO of 
           YOUNGER ETHAN and Doug each wearing custom t-shirts that 
           read “son” and “dad”, respectively. This makes Doug 
           smile, a beat rolls by...

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s like I’m his science project 
                        or something.

           Ethan unscrews the cap, and lifts the bottle to his 
           mouth...BUT IT’S SWIPED AWAY before it touches his lips 
           by Doug...who DOWNS IT IN ONE GULP. Then gags a little.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        What the hell, Dad?

                                 DOUG
                        I was thirsty. There’s plenty more 
                        downsta--the fuck are these?

           Doug notices a SET OF NEW GOLF CLUBS sitting in the 
           corner. 

                                 ETHAN
                        (duh) Golf clubs.

                                 DOUG
                        I know that, but what are they 
                        doing here?

                                 ETHAN
                        Grandpa bought them for me. Said I 
                        needed a hobby. Something like 
                        golf to teach me the “value of 
                        hard work and discipline.”

                                 DOUG
                        (to himself) Asshole.

                                 ETHAN
                        I told him I already have a hobby, 
                        but he didn’t seem to care. 
                        Grandpa really loves golf.
                                 DOUG
                        Golf is fucking stupid and 
                        elitist. And so is your fucking 
                        Grandfather. Fuck!

           Hearing the “F” word fly out of his father’s mouth with 
           such reckless abandon seems to jar, and entertain, 
           Ethan...the slightest smile curling.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Your mother might not agree with 
                        me on this one, but Grandpa 
                        doesn’t always know what’s best. 
                        Learning to play golf, or bike 
                        riding, or any other stupid 
                        activity isn’t going to make you 
                        perform better at school.

                                 ETHAN
                        Am I sick, Dad? Dr. Roth said 
                        something about putting me on 
                        medication.

                                 DOUG
                        No. You’re not sick. You’re just 
                        12. And being twelve sucks, for 
                        everyone. And everyone gets into 
                        some weird shit around this age. I 
                        mean, I used to fuck the couch 
                        when I was 12.

                                 ETHAN
                        (starting to laugh) What?

                                 DOUG
                        You heard me. Rather than use my 
                        hand to, you know (motions jerking 
                        off) I’d stuff a towel in the 
                        couch and, well, fuck it.

           Ethan is laughing hysterically now, which makes Doug feel 
           like a million bucks.

                                 ETHAN
                        That’s crazy.

                                 DOUG
                        Like I said, it ain’t easy at your 
                        age. But then, one day, you look 
                        up and you’re okay again...without 
                        doctors, or drugs, or anything 
                        else.

                                 ETHAN 
                        You and mom aren’t okay.
                                 DOUG
                        You’re right. But we’re working on 
                        it.

                                 ETHAN
                        If you say so...couch fucker.

           They laugh again.

                                 DOUG
                        (fearing the worse) Now, uh, 
                        what’s this hobby you’ve got?

                                 ETHAN
                        Ninja Juhakkei.

                                 DOUG
                        Cool. (beat) What is that?

           Ethan hands him a BLACK METAL THROWING STAR...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        And what is this?

                                 ETHAN
                        It’s a ninja throwing star. It’s a 
                        weapon.

                                 DOUG
                        So, you collect these?

                                 ETHAN
                        Among other things.

           Ethan pulls a LARGE BOX from underneath his bed. Popping 
           the top IT’S FILLED WITH ALL SORTS OF NINJA WEAPONS.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        There’s 18 different weapon 
                        disciplines to master. I’ve only 
                        got 11 so far.

                                 DOUG
                        Cool.

                                 ETHAN
                        Really? You’re not mad?

                                 DOUG
                        Well, should I be? I don’t know 
                        much about Ninjas.

                                 ETHAN
                        No. I just collect the stuff. It’s 
                        not like I’m out there killing 
                        squirrels or destroying public 
                        property.
           Doug lifts up a BLOW GUN with its DARTS, and smiles.

                                 DOUG
                        Would you like to?

           EXT. GRASSY KNOLL - NIGHT

           A rustle in the bushes...then Doug and Ethan appear. 
           FACES COATED IN WAR PAINT and wearing all black - ninja 
           style - they creep into position while eyeballing a 
           target in the distance.

                                 ETHAN
                        Are you sure about this, Dad? We 
                        could get in trouble.

                                 DOUG
                        Gimme that thing.

           Doug yanks the BLOW GUN from him, loads it with a LARGE 
           DART and gives it a heave of air...WOOSH-SNAP-CRASH, the 
           sound of GLASS breaking in the distance.

                            ETHAN
                                                          DOUG
           Holy shit!
                                               Oh my god.

           With one shot, Doug has SHATTERED THE TOWN SQUARE CLOCK. 
           After the initial shock wears off, they laugh.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Here, you try.

           Doug hands the blow gun to Ethan who loads it with 
           another large dart, and lets fly...CRASH. He’s BUSTED A 
           VINTAGE LAMP POST. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Awesome! What should we hit next?

           Doug’s EYES ARE LOCKED on something. He smiles...

           EXT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           It sits in the heart of the square, silent, save for the 
           dull hum from the illuminated NEW “BISHOP’S” sign.

           Ethan and Doug stand before it, fully armed...

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t know if this is such a 
                        good idea, Dad.

                                 DOUG
                        Isn’t not...it’s a great idea.
           And, with that, he hauls off an WHIPS one of the Chinese 
           Stars into the new sign. Light bulbs EXPLODE!

           Following his father’s lead, Ethan does the same. And 
           together they unleash an ONSLAUGHT on the pharmacy. IN 
           GLORIOUS FASHION, we watch as they lay waste to the sign. 

           The catharsis of this act, along with the drugs, has Doug 
           grinning from ear-to-ear. Out of ammo, he grabs a METAL-
           MESH GARBAGE CAN and throws it THROUGH THE GIANT GLASS 
           BAY WINDOW. The CRASH AND FLYING GLASS are 
           spectacular...but the reality of the damage is jarring.

                                 ETHAN
                        Holy fuck, Dad.

                                 DOUG
                        Run!

           They sprint off into the night laughing, awkwardly 
           slapping five, sounds of DOGS BARKING in the distance.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - GARAGE - LATER

           The car pulls in and the door closes behind them. They 
           sit there for a minute, faces still painted and eyes 
           aglow with mischief.

                                 ETHAN
                        Thanks, dad.

                                 DOUG
                        For what?

                                 ETHAN
                        Tonight. It was fun.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah. It was, wasn’t it. (then) I 
                        know you don’t want to ‘talk’ and, 
                        quite frankly, neither do I. So 
                        just tell me what this shit-stuff 
                        at school is all about.

                                 ETHAN
                        (sigh) In the warrior code, it is 
                        written, that the highest insult 
                        is to smear one’s excrement on the 
                        home of their adversary.

           Doug nods, soaking in his son’s rationale.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Andy Berg, Kevin Redmond, David 
                        Chen...they’re all dicks. All they 
                        do is make fun of me, so...
                                 DOUG
                        So you insult their honor with 
                        your poop?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.

                                 DOUG
                        Well, I think you’ve achieved the 
                        desired affect so do your old man 
                        a favor and give it a rest, okay?

                                 ETHAN
                        Alright.

                                 DOUG
                        Thank you. Now go clean that war 
                        paint off your face before your 
                        mother starts asking questions.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           They enter and Doug is about to fix himself a Vodka...

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        Dad...

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah?

                                 ETHAN
                        There’s this thing next week - 
                        bring your dad to school or some 
                        shit - it’ll probably be gay, but 
                        if you showed up it would look 
                        pretty good for the both of us...

                                 DOUG
                        (beaming) I’ll be there.

                                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - EARLY MORNING 

           Where the once-pristine NEW “BISHOP’S RX” sign has been 
           reduced to a collection of busted glass, metal, and 
           plastic. A YOUNG UNIFORM COP on a ladder looks baffled, 
           as he pulls a CHINESE THROWING STAR from the rubble.

                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Everyone, just stay back. Thank 
                        you.

           THE WOODBURY POLICE look baffled as to protocol. Not much 
           crime ever happens here...evident by the fact that an 
           OFFICER can’t even unfurl the “Crime Scene” tape. 
           WALTER’S GOLD CADILLAC screeches up to the curb. He hops 
           out, still in his robe, thick white hair mussed, and 
           mouth agape from what he’s seeing...

                                 WALTER
                        What in the fuck happened here?

           THE YOUNG OFFICER (WILLITS) approaches...

                                 OFFICER WILLITS
                        Mr. Bishop, I’m Officer Willits. 
                        We spoke on the phone--

                                 WALTER
                        --You said ‘incident.’ That there 
                        had been an incident. This is a 
                        Goddamn warzone!

           He pushes past Officer Willits and stomps over to DOUG, 
           who stands there wearing SUNGLASSES and one of the new 
           shirt/tie combos Elizabeth bought for him. Calmly sipping 
           his coffee watching with subdued pride and air of cool.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Who could’ve done all this?!

                                 DOUG
                        Not sure, Walter. But I think 
                        Officer Willits here had a 
                        promising lead on, what was it--

                                 OFFICER WILLITS
                        --Ninjas.

           Officer Willits hands him an EVIDENCE BAG containing the 
           throwing stars...

                                 WALTER
                        The fuck is a Ninja?

                                 OFFICER WILLITS
                        It’s an ancient Japanese warrior, 
                        cloaked in black, often with 
                        mystical powers.

                                 DOUG
                        Sounds pretty serious, Walter.

                                 WALTER
                        Why in the fuck would an ancient 
                        Japanese Warrior destroy a 
                        pharmacy sign in Connecticut!?

                                 OFFICER WILLITS
                        Our investigation is ongoing and, 
                        as soon as we have more 
                        information, we’ll let you know.
                                 WALTER
                        Doug, what are we going to do 
                        about this?

                                 DOUG
                        I think it best if we leave this 
                        in the capable hands of the 
                        Woodbury PD. They seem to have 
                        things under control. Now, if 
                        you’ll excuse me, I need to go 
                        take inventory after this heinous 
                        crime. Excuse me, gentlemen.

           Doug turns and walks back into the Pharmacy, HUGE GRIN 
           SPREADING ON HIS FACE...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Doug did have more important 
                        things to take care of...

           INT. BISHOP’S RX - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Up in his lab-station area, Doug works feverishly, but 
           focused. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        He had no time to dwell on his 
                        latest victory. It was time to 
                        prepare for the next...

           Grabbing his “tools” and the stray pills that were “lost” 
           Doug is a whirl-wind at work on something...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Even with months of regimented 
                        training and proper diet, Doug 
                        would still fall short in the Tour 
                        de Woodbury. 

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        Consult!

                                 DOUG
                        You do it!

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        However, Doug had no intentions of 
                        going quietly this year. In fact, 
                        he planned to compete at a very, 
                        very high level. 

           One by one, he throws ingredients together grinding them 
           down to a fine powder with his mortar & pestle...
                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Using a base of hypertropin growth 
                        hormone for quicker recovery, 30 
                        milligrams of glycolysis to stave 
                        off cramping caused by lactic 
                        acidosis, along with highly 
                        concentrated doses of adderall for 
                        focus, Oxycontin to numb his legs, 
                        a good old fashion 10 cc’s of 
                        methamphetamine for that extra 
                        burst when all other systems 
                        failed. It was, most definitively, 
                        a recipe for success.

           With expert precision, he adds the liquid bonding agent 
           to the powder, turning it to that DOUGHY SUBSTANCE he 
           then pours into the MINI-MUFFIN TRAY to mold GIANT HORSE 
           PILLS. They are scary and awesome looking.

           EXT. WOODBURY PARK - AFTERNOON

           Buzzing with activity, spectators and competitors alike 
           flood the STARTING LINE AREA of the Tour de Woodbury.

           Doug, SWEATING PROFUSELY and GRINDING HIS TEETH, walks 
           his bike to the starting line with the same intense gaze 
           of THE INCREDIBLE HULK. Accidentally, he BANGS into a 
           little girl, causing her to lose grip on a bundle of 
           balloons which floats away into the sky. Her Dad turns...

                                 LOCAL DAD
                        Hey! Watch where you’re going--

                                 DOUG
                        --Fuck off.

           The Dad recoils a bit, Doug doesn’t even look at him...

           AT THE STARTING LINE...

           Doug pushes his way right TO THE FRONT, where we 
           recognize some of the people from his weekend warrior 
           biking troupe...and KARA, who looks askance at Doug. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Whoa, look who it is!

           We recognize this guy as one of the JACKASSES (ED) from 
           their weekend warrior biking group.

                                 ED
                        Sure you want to get tangled up 
                        front with the big dogs, Dougie? 
                                 DOUG
                        Hey, Ed. Maybe you should worry 
                        more about the clotrimazol cream 
                        clearing up that fungus growing 
                        inside your asshole, and less 
                        about where I start the race.

           This quiets Ed right down. Doug readies himself into 
           position a few riders over from KARA...

                                 KARA
                        What are you doing, Doug?

                                 DOUG
                        Baking a red velvet cake. What 
                        does it look like I’m doing?

                                 KARA
                        You don’t honestly think you can 
                        compete in this thing?

                                 DOUG
                        I’m not here to compete. I’m here 
                        to win.

                                 KARA
                        Sure you are.

           A race official steps up holding the starting gun...

                                 RACE OFFICIAL
                        Racers, take your marks...ready...

           AN EXTENDED BEAT that seems to last forever, as Kara and 
           Doug stare one another down...BANG! The gun goes off and 
           the bikers shoot out of the blocks.

           EXT. WOODBURY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           With traffic blocked off, the Bikers have the roads to 
           themselves...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        It was tight for the first few 
                        miles, but soon the contenders 
                        separated from the pretenders and 
                        Doug was right there with them. It 
                        was unchartered territory for him, 
                        but he was adjusting nicely.

           Whipping around turns, pedaling with purpose, Doug is 
           focused and right in the mix of things...but he starts to 
           fade and fall towards the back.
                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Doug had never been able to keep 
                        up like this before and he was 
                        losing steam. Victory was slipping 
                        away. 

           Doug pops a pill and splashes it down with water.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (CONT’D)
                        However, if one of something is 
                        good, two is certainly better...

           A beat, and he pops another pill.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And, this time, Doug was playing 
                        for keeps.

           After a minute, Doug regains his mojo and steams back 
           into the mix. He flies past a WATER STATION, when he 
           hears...

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        Go, Dad, go!

           He spies Ethan on the shoulder cheering wildly for him. 
           This makes him pedal even harder. He quickly gains on...

           ED. Neck-and-neck and as Doug’s about to pass him, Ed 
           panics, SWERVING INTO DOUG’s path. Doug dodges. Ed tries 
           again, but misses. 

                                 DOUG
                        Jesus Christ, Ed.

                                 ED
                        Not today, Varney. Not ever! I 
                        told you not to get tangled up 
                        with the big dogs. WOOF-WOOF--

           WHAM! Caught up in his ranting, ED CRASHES INTO A PARKED 
           CAR, sending him FLYING OVER HIS HANDLE BARS and down to 
           the ground violently. Doug GIVES HIM THE FINGER as he 
           pedals away...

           EXT. WOODBURY PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Kara, measured and focused, has the lead all to herself. 
           And, with the finish line breaking in the distance, she 
           starts to ease up slightly when we hear...

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        On your left!

           WHIZ...DOUG FLIES BY HER, kicking up leaves and twigs in 
           his wake. Kara’s ‘oh shit’ face firmly in place, begins 
           to shift gears and pedal hard again, but it’s no use...
           EXT. WOODBURY PARK - FINISH LINE - CONTINUOUS

           The crowd waits anxiously for the racers...

                                 RACE OFFICIAL
                        Wait, I think I see something. 
                        Yup, here they come!

           They start to cheer wildly...FOR DOUG. All by himself, 
           buzzing down the straight away. The cheers taper off 
           slightly, Doug not being who they had anticipated.

           Hands raised above his head, Doug PUNCHES THE SKY with 
           joy, as he zips across the finish line. In the crowd we 
           see Ethan clap and whistle, proud of his dad...Walter, 
           next to him does not share his enthusiasm, looking on as 
           Kara finishes amongst the rest, not even placing.

           Even ELIZABETH WATCHES from afar through her designer 
           sunglasses. Despite her effortless cool, she SMILES WIDE 
           and claps, happy for Doug.

                                                              JUMP CUT TO:

           THE RACERS PODIUM...

           Where Doug stands atop the rest, being handed his first 
           place GOLD MEDAL and TROPHY, hoisting it above his head.

           Kara settles for the shitty “Sportsmanship” ribbon, 
           throwing it in the trash bin.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Doug Varney was not used to 
                        winning...

           INT. LIZ’S MERCEDES - WOODS - LATER

           The familiar position of Doug’s legs hanging out the 
           Mercedes backseat door, riding pants around his ankles, 
           as he plows away on top of ELIZABETH. His GOLD MEDAL 
           still around his neck, it dangles in Elizabeth’s face.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        ...but he was beginning to enjoy 
                        how it felt.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Doug CRANKS OUT PUSH-UPS on the carpet, still WIRED FROM 
           HIS RACE-TIME CONCOCTION. He pops up and checks himself 
           out in the mirror. His body doesn’t look particularly 
           different, but his confidence somehow makes him look more 
           handsome. 
           Emerging from the bathroom wrapped in a towel, Kara is a 
           little taken aback at the sight of her husband.

                                 KARA
                        Oh. Doug. Hi.

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, honey. All finished in there?

                                 KARA
                        Yep.

           The same rote conversation they’ve had for years. Until 
           Doug drops his pants. Kara finds herself looking at 
           Doug’s junk. Staring, actually. Doug notices her noticing 
           but plays it off. Whistling, he heads towards the 
           bathroom. Before he gets there, though...

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        Doug?

                                 DOUG
                        Yes?

                                 KARA
                        I just...well, I was impressed 
                        today. I never thought you had it 
                        in you.

           Doug walks back over, STANDING NAKED in front of her, not 
           giving a fuck. 

                                 DOUG
                        You’d be surprised what I’m 
                        capable of.

           She nods, intrigued by the machismo, then starts to 
           giggle, and we can tell from her sight line that she’s 
           worried about getting stabbed.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        What is it? What’s so funny?

           Suddenly shy and giddy, she nods at his midsection.

                                 KARA
                        I just haven’t seen your - you 
                        know - in a while. Not in the 
                        daylight, or on a weekend, anyway. 

           As MASTODON blares from Ethan’s next door room, a frisky 
           Doug PUSHES HER DOWN onto the bed...

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        Ooh, Mr. Tough Guy now that he 
                        wins a race.
           She mounts him, seizing control. But this time, Doug’s 
           not having it and wrestles with her for position...

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing...?

           A cornucopia of hormones and performance enhancing drugs 
           still coursing through his body, he’s wild eyed.

                                 DOUG
                        Sometimes you gotta know when to 
                        shut up and just give it to a 
                        girl.

           He then flips her over, mounting up from behind.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        It’s called being a man.

           On his first thrust Kara is instantly in euphoria. We 
           close up on her face to see that she is blown away by her 
           husband’s “newfound” prowess. 

                                 KARA
                        Doug! Ohshitohshitohshit!!

           She moans loudly as Doug bangs away IN TIME with the 
           HEAVY BEAT of the music with a look of ecstacy and 
           twisted pleasure. Not dissimilar to the look he had when 
           he trashed the pharmacy. He’s really going at it now.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OH MY--

           Kara COMES LIKE A TON OF BRICKS. Staccato panting, trying 
           to catch her breath, she is delirious. Doug grins...

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        Doug. That was...that was--

                                 DOUG
                        --I know. (then) I’m gonna make 
                        some pizza bagels, let me know if 
                        you want some.

           And Doug walks out, leaving an orgasmic Kara tangled in 
           the sheets.

           INT. BISHOP’S - MORNING

           EXTREME CLOSE UP on A LEFTOVER CIVIC AWARD from the 
           Woodbury Council to Walter that’s still on a shelf in the 
           back area. A beat, and then Doug YANKS IT OFF AND THROWS 
           IT IN THE TRASH, replacing it with the GLEAMING TROPHY 
           from the race and taking a few steps back to gaze with 
           pride.
                                 AGENT CARP (O.S.)
                        That’s some trophy.

           Doug turns to find AGENT CARP admiring the trophy.

                                 AGENT CARP (CONT’D)
                        I won one like that back at a high 
                        school track meet. Steeplechase. 

                                 DOUG
                        Difficult event.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Yeah. But there’s something about 
                        people chasing you that brings out 
                        your best, ya know? Too bad we 
                        can’t have people chase us for the 
                        rest of our lives, right!?

           Carp laughs at his own quip...Doug feigning along with 
           him, if he only knew. An awkward beat.

                                 AGENT CARP (CONT’D)
                        Looks like you had yourself a bit 
                        of a break-in the other day. 

           A GLAZER is putting the finishing touches on the NEW 
           WINDOW.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah. Crazy. Busted the sign, the 
                        window there. They really tore the 
                        place up.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Terrible. (then) Anyhoo, it’s the 
                        damnedest thing. I ran the data 
                        from the inventory against our 
                        prescription database again today, 
                        and it didn’t add up. I mean, not 
                        at all. 

                                 DOUG
                        Could be because of those vandals. 
                        Maybe they snagged some of the 
                        missing medicat--

                                 AGENT CARP
                        --No. No. Not according to...

           Carp flips through his pad, before landing on a page...

                                 AGENT CARP (CONT’D)
                        ...the police report here. Says 
                        that nothing had been stolen from 
                        the premises. Not a thing.
                                 DOUG
                        Shit. That’s strange.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Didn’t realize you were a 
                        compounding pharmacy, Doug.

           Carp nods at THE MORTAR AND PESTLE coated in a fine 
           powder, sitting smack in Doug’s work area...

                                 DOUG
                        Oh, this? I’m...we’re not, really. 
                        But I have this one customer, an 
                        older gentleman. He’s all screwed 
                        up. Parkinson’s. Needs a delicate 
                        and precise balance of Rotigotine, 
                        Levodopa, and Pramipexole. And he 
                        has trouble swallowing so I have 
                        to make up a paste for transdermal 
                        application. 

                                 AGENT CARP
                        And which customer is this...?

                                 DOUG
                        (poker face) You know I can’t tell 
                        you that, Agent Carp.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Right. Of course. I’m sorry, it’s 
                        just that I hadn’t noticed it 
                        before, that’s all. Anyway, like I 
                        was saying, I’m sure this is all 
                        just a glitch, but if you’ll just 
                        show me your ledgers for the last 
                        12 months I can get this over with 
                        as quickly as possible.

                                 DOUG
                        Sure thing. The only problem is, 
                        I’ve got them at my home office.

                                 CARP
                        Mr. Varney, I’m sure you know that 
                        Federal Code 101.b-12 of the 
                        Narcotics Distribtion Act requires 
                        that all ledgers be kept at the 
                        licensed facility.

                                 DOUG
                        And 99.9% of the time they are. 
                        It’s just...it’s just that after 
                        your last visit I was so concerned 
                        with getting things right that I 
                        took my ledgers home to double 
                        check against my own records, 
                        which I keep on my personal 
                        computer. At home. 
           Doug slaps the side of his head, as if to say ‘duh.’ Carp 
           silently makes notes in his pad. Growing more concerned, 
           Doug fills the void...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        I mean, look, I spilled a bottle 
                        of Amoxicillin the other day. I 
                        got most of ‘em, but might’ve
                        missed a few, may have even 
                        stepped on one. I didn’t say 
                        anything because, well, like you 
                        said, everyone does that now and 
                        then.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Everyone but Walter Bishop.

                                 DOUG
                        I’ve had my hands full and, I 
                        mean, just look at my staff.

           He nods at Janet and Noah, who surreptitiously drops out 
           of view when he sees Doug pointing at him.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        OK, tell ya what. If you want to 
                        hang out for a bit, I can run home 
                        and get them right now.

           Agent Carp looks him in the eyes. Doug doesn’t flinch. 
           The tension thickens, until Carp POPS it by clicking his 
           pen closed. 

                                 CARP
                        That won’t be necessary, Doug. 
                        I’ll be back up this way in a 
                        couple days. Howabout you just 
                        have them here for me then?

           They shake hands. Agent Carp heads for the exit... 

                                 DOUG
                        You got it. And, hey, thanks again 
                        Agent Carp, for letting me off the 
                        hook!

                                 AGENT CARP
                        This investigation is still 
                        pending, Mr. Varney. I haven’t let 
                        anybody off the hook yet.

           Doug’s smile falls as he meets Agent Carp’s all-business 
           stare. The bell jingles, Carp is gone, and Doug takes an 
           EXCEEDINGLY DEEP BREATH. 

           PANNING DOWN, we see a series of large LEDGERS for EVERY 
           MONTH OF 2010 lined up neatly on the SHELF right next to 
           Doug’s legs.
           OFF THE RING OF A DOORBELL...

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - EVENING

           The HUGE OAK DOORS are swung open to REVEAL: Doug, still 
           in his lab coat and work clothing, looking just this side 
           of crazy..

                                 DOUG
                        Okay. I’m in.

           And he pushes her inside, closing the door behind them. 
           He shoves her up against the wall, kissing her forcibly 
           and caressing her breasts. She pushes him away.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m sorry? In for what...?

                                 DOUG
                        For, you know, the plan 
                        (pantomimes slicing his neck). 
                        Let’s do it. Let’s start over.

           And again he begins to kiss her. She kisses back for a 
           beat before breaking off again.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Plan? Doug, we were just joking 
                        around-- 

                                 DOUG
                        --(hurried, antsy) I know. I know 
                        we were. But I’ve been thinking. A 
                        lot. I’ve been thinking a lot 
                        about everything. I mean, shit, my 
                        wife fucking hates me, and this 
                        Carp guy is all over me - I won’t 
                        do well in jail - I just...

           Elizabeth leads him to the leather couch, pouring him a 
           glass of wine and pushing a PILL into his mouth...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Here. This will take the edge off.

           He swallows.

                                 DOUG
                        Thank you. (then) What I’m saying 
                        is...you’re right. You’re always 
                        right. And I’m the pharmacist. 
                        And, well, he’s the guy with the 
                        bad heart...

           Doug nods to the PORTRAIT WITH HER HUSBAND over the 
           fireplace...
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Okay. Let’s do it. Tomorrow.

                                 DOUG
                        Jesus. So soon...?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t want to waste anymore time 
                        being unhappy.

                                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY - DAY

           Top down on the Mercedes, Scarf over her hair, sunglasses 
           on, Elizabeth cruises along. Expressionless look on her 
           face...

                                 ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                        Tomorrow, will work best. I 
                        sometimes head out to our Hamptons
                        house first thing Friday morning 
                        to beat the weekend rush. So, it 
                        won’t be a surprise that I’m 
                        gone...

           INT. BISHOP’S - EVENING

           Just another day at work. Janet helps an old lady with 
           cosmetics, as Doug counts out a set of pills, preparing 
           to funnel them into a bottle.

                                 ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                        As we’ve discussed, Jack takes 
                        medication for his heart. ACE 
                        inhibitors, beta blockers, ARBs.

           We look down at the pills. UP CLOSE, they read: 
           “Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) ‘Teveten’ 400mg.”

                                 DOUG (V.O.)
                        Yes, that’s a powerful mix. 
                        Actually, I usually recommend 
                        Diavan, but that’s--

                                 ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                        --Not really important right now, 
                        is it? What’s important is the 
                        dosage. Because of the various 
                        drugs, Jack gets a 300 mg dose of 
                        Teveten. But if he were to get, 
                        say, 400 mgs... 

           Doug places pill bottles in an envelope, then places the 
           envelope in the BIN FOR DELIVERY where Noah picks it up.
                                 ELIZABETH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That slight bump, in combination 
                        with his usual after-dinner trough 
                        of scotch...

           INT. ELIZABETH’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           We see her husband, from behind only, as he comes in the 
           back door, dropping off some paperwork and flipping 
           through the mail. 

           On the counter is his pill dispenser with a note: “Left 
           early to beat traffic. See you tomorrow! All my love, E.”
           He pours himself a large glass of Scotch, sits down in a 
           wing chair and pops the pills, snapping his head back to 
           swallow them.

                                 ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                        Well, then, when they call me in 
                        the Hamptons the next day, it’s 
                        “Oh my God, officer, I’ll be there 
                        as soon as I can.”

           Her husband slowly slides off the chair, collapsing in a 
           heap, Scotch spilling everywhere.

                                 ELIZABETH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m his sole beneficiary. So, I 
                        sign some papers, collect it all, 
                        and tell them wire the funds to 
                        wherever we end up...

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Liz and Doug, dressed glamorously, ride along in a 
           convertible laughing with not a care in the world...

           BACK TO REALITY

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Doug swirls his Chardonnay around the glass.

                                 DOUG
                        That’s it? Just like that, huh?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Just like that. You get to tell 
                        that Bitch on Wheels where to 
                        stick it, and then we spend the 
                        rest of our lives buying whatever 
                        looks good and giving each other 
                        mind-blowing orgasms. God, this is 
                        exciting.
           Doug smiles and leans in to kiss her, but she stops him.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Wait, this is important; no calls, 
                        no contact whatsoever. Nothing 
                        that can tie us together or leave 
                        a trail. So, this will be the last 
                        time we talk for a while. 

                                 DOUG
                        How...how long? I thought--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --C’mon, Doug. Do I have to spell 
                        everything out for you? We have to 
                        be careful. At least until this 
                        all blows over, if not longer.

           He looks forlorn, maybe even doubting things...

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, baby. This is about us and 
                        we’re so close.

                                 DOUG
                        I know, I know.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, just so you don’t forget.

           She kisses him real quick then slinks out of frame...a 
           ZIP is heard, and a smile spreads on Doug’s face.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BISHOP’S RX - DAY

           Doug works away at his station, filling orders, when 
           JANET steps into frame holding prescriptions.

                                 JANET
                        Fax orders just came in...

           Taking a deep breath, Doug looks at them, knowing full 
           well what awaits. He leafs through until he spots it: 
           “Roberts, Jack”...then goes to work.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Doug filled the order like he 
                        always did...but with one slight 
                        change. When Jack Roberts took his 
                        medication tonight, he would not 
                        wake up the next morning.

           We watch as Doug manipulates things...
                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (CONT’D)
                        Teveten was a very potent medicine 
                        to begin with, coming with 
                        detailed specific instructions to 
                        monitor dosage. There was a long 
                        history of people misreading this 
                        information, causing their heart 
                        to race like a jackrabbit, and 
                        ending up in the emergency room. 
                        Making a slight change to its 
                        potency would render these pills 
                        deadly and close to undetectable 
                        in any toxicology report.

           Doug finishes counting out the pills, swipes them into 
           the plastic orange bottle, then puts the label on and 
           seals it shut.

           SUPER CLOSE UP ON the prescription bag: “ROBERTS, JACK” 
           being carried like a baby...

           Doug, looking a little pale, sets the bag in the bin, 
           flipping through to make sure he places it in proper 
           alphabetical order. 

                                 DOUG
                        Noah?

                                 NOAH (O.S.)
                        Yeah, boss?

           Noah spins around, wearing ELVIS STYLE SUNGLASSES that 
           he’s pulled off the SALE RACK. He adopts an Elvis pose, 
           arms extended, and accidentally KNOCKS OVER THE DELIVERY 
           BIN, sending prescription bags scattering everywhere.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Shit, I’m sorry.

                                 DOUG
                        Honestly! What the hell’s the 
                        matter with you?

           Doug kneels down hastily jamming the spilled bags of 
           prescriptions into their section best he can, while Noah 
           helps in vain...trying his best not to laugh.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        For Christ’s--the fuck are you on?

                                 NOAH
                        I’m fine. I’m fine. Big night last 
                        night, just a little hungover.

                                 DOUG
                        Are you okay to drive?
                                 NOAH
                        I drove here, didn’t I.

                                 DOUG
                        Not the answer I was looking for, 
                        but I’ll take it. Now, listen 
                        carefully...

           He plucks the sunglasses off Noah’s head and, kneeling 
           face-to-face with him on the floor, looks into his 
           bloodshot, DILATED SAUCER-LIKE EYES.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        It’s imperative that all these 
                        deliveries make it out today. ALL 
                        OF THEM. People have been 
                        complaining and we need to show 
                        our customers we can still be 
                        counted on...like that big clock 
                        in the square. To always be right. 
                        Accurate. Trustworthy.

                                 NOAH
                        But...that clock’s broken, Doug.

                                 DOUG
                        (sigh) Just make the deliveries.

                                 NOAH
                        You can count on me, Doug.

                                 DOUG
                        No, I can’t. Which is why we’re 
                        having this conversation. Just get 
                        these done, okay.

           Noah picks up the bin and gives Doug a SALUTE before 
           spinning around and walking outside.

           Doug moves to the window, watching his delivery boy 
           placing Doug’s new life in the passenger seat of his BEAT 
           UP Kia Sportage and driving off. 

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Janet!

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        Let me guess? We’re closing.

           INT. LUM CHIN’S CHINESE RESTAURANT - BAR - EVENING

           Dimly lit BAR AREA of the popular restaurant, populated 
           by “regulars,” being tended to by a THIN CHINESE 
           BARTENDER (HU). 
           Judging by the small army of empty tumblers in front of 
           Doug, he’s had a few. Each time someone enters the 
           restaurant, Doug points and mutters...

                                 DOUG
                        That’s Jerry Heller. He’s been on 
                        Prozac for about a year now...but 
                        his wife’s on Ritalin. You think 
                        they’d balance each other out.

           Another guy walks in...we recognize him as ARNOLD 
           MORELLO, out with HIS WIFE.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Oh. And, lookie-loo, it’s Mailman 
                        Morello. (calling out) Hey, Arnie! 
                        You ever get back to Atlantic 
                        City?! Yes?! No?! 

           Mailman’s wife looks at him confused, he quickly brushes 
           it off as they walk inside...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        They don’t even realize, Hu. I’m 
                        the man behind the curtain. The 
                        Wizard. I pull the strings.

                                 HU
                        Yes, sir.

           ANOTHER PERSON walks inside. An OLDER GUY with gray hair, 
           but this time heads for the bar...next to Doug.

                                 GRAY HAIR MAN
                        Anyone sitting here?

                                 DOUG
                        Be my guest.

                                 HU
                        Evening, sir. Something from the 
                        bar?

                                 GRAY HAIR MAN
                        Black label, neat. Thanks.

                                 DOUG
                        And, another Grey Goose martini on 
                        the rocks for me. Extra olives.

                                 GRAY HAIR MAN
                        Amazing. That’s the same exact 
                        drink my wife orders.

                                 DOUG
                        It is? 
                                 GRAY HAIR MAN
                        Yeah. Then again, martini’s are 
                        pretty popular, I guess...

                                 DOUG
                        Do I know you?

                                 GRAY HAIR MAN
                        Jack Roberts, moved in a few 
                        months back. Over on Donneybrook.

           HOLY SHIT...they shake hands. Doug immediately cools and 
           tenses towards this man that he’s been taught to despise.

                                 DOUG
                        Right, right. Doug Varney, good to 
                        meet you. It’s the big place on 
                        the cul-de-sac, right?

                                 JACK
                        Yeah. Too big, if you ask me. You 
                        live in town, Doug?

                                 DOUG
                        Over 10 years now. I actually own 
                        the pharmacy on the square.

                                 JACK
                        Oh, then you definitely know my 
                        wife. 

                                 DOUG
                        Why would you say that?

                                 JACK
                        The woman takes enough pills to 
                        keep Pfizer in business.

                                 DOUG
                        (I don’t know her) We get a lot of 
                        customers, so...

           Hu drops off their drinks and Jack takes a LONG SLUG, 
           almost finishing his in one shot. We also notice that 
           Doug and Jack’s shirts are of a similar cut and style.

                                 JACK
                        You married, Doug?

                                 DOUG
                        Why? You trying to pick me up?

           Jack laughs. Doug smiles, then brandishes his WEDDING 
           RING, clinking it against his tumbler...

                                 JACK
                        It’s hard goddamn work being 
                        married.
                                 DOUG
                        They don’t tell you that part when 
                        you’re registering at Crate & 
                        Barrel.

                                 JACK
                        No, they certainly don’t. This is 
                        my third, and I still have no clue 
                        what I’m doing.

                                 DOUG
                        It’s not you, pal. It’s them. 

                                 JACK
                        You said it, Doug. I’ve always 
                        been the type of that keeps a 
                        steady stream of gifts rolling in, 
                        to avoid conflict. I mean, I’m 
                        lucky I make a nice living, no 
                        reason not to spread it around. 
                        Women are tough, but there’s 
                        nothing like seeing their face 
                        when you come home with flowers or 
                        something sparkling, ya know.

           Doug stares at Jack, trying to provoke him. It’s then 
           that JACK’S FOOD ORDER ARRIVES in a brown bag.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        (re: the food) Wifey’s away, so 
                        I’m cooking.

                                 DOUG
                        I know...what that’s like.

           Jack’s definitely a little confused by Doug. Hu lays down 
           the checks, but Jack grabs BOTH HIS AND DOUG’S.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        (aside) Mr. and Mrs. Roberts 
                        always pick up the tab, huh?

                                 JACK
                        What’s that?

                                 DOUG
                        Oh...you shouldn’t--

                                 JACK
                        --My treat. Least I can do for a 
                        new neighbor, right? Besides, 
                        heard what those vandals did to 
                        your store. Disgusting.

           Jack peels off a few twenty’s from his WAD OF MONEY and 
           lays them on the bar.
                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        See you around, Doug.

           And out walks the “Monster” Liz has poisoned Doug’s ear 
           about now for weeks...and he’s about as likeable as they 
           get. Doug SLAMS the rest of his drink.

                                 DOUG
                        Barkeep!

           The bartender comes back over, not looking so friendly.

                                 HU
                        Mistah Dougras, you cut off.

                                 DOUG
                        No more drinky. I need some paper. 
                        And a pen.

           The bartender shrugs, looks around, and hands Doug a 
           piece of OFFICIAL LUM CHIN’S STATIONERY. 

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Hu.

           As he begins to write...

                                 DOUG (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Dear Kara, by the time you read 
                        this letter I’ll be gone. 

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           Doug, tipsy from his drinks at Lum Chin’s, staggers into 
           the house, dropping his keys loudly on the floor. 

                                 DOUG
                        SHHHH!

           Shushing himself, he giggles and bends over to pick them 
           up, nearly falling over.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Wasted and hungry, he climbs up and grabs the OREOS.
           Returning to the table to CRUSH THEM UP and make the same 
           gross/delicious meal Ethan enjoys for breakfast.

                                 DOUG (V.O.)
                        I know I haven’t been what your 
                        father thought you deserved. But 
                        you know what...I don’t fucking 
                        care.

           He slurps from the bowl...
                                 DOUG (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Believe it or not, there was a 
                        time I did care about what you 
                        thought...and I cared about you. 
                        But that all ended when the sweet, 
                        funny, adventurous girl I met next 
                        door to me in Penland Hall junior 
                        year, transformed into a self-
                        centered cunt lurching towards 
                        menopause. Don’t believe me, just 
                        ask the few friends you have left.

           Doug quietly slips into his closet, putting a few things 
           in a bag.

                                 DOUG (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I know this will be hard on Ethan, 
                        and that breaks my heart. But, in 
                        the long run, this will be better 
                        for him too. Better to be raised 
                        by two happy parents apart then 
                        miserable ones together. But, if 
                        he starts in with the shitting
                        stuff again, let me know.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - ETHAN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Doug looks down at his sleeping son.

                                 DOUG (V.O.)
                        I’ve tried, Kara. I’ve tried hard. 
                        But you can’t help someone unless 
                        they’re ready to help themselves 
                        first. So, with this letter, I 
                        leave you to wallow in your own 
                        miserable little existence. Where 
                        you’ll most likely die alone, if 
                        you don’t get clipped in a bike 
                        accident first.

           He kisses Ethan, props up one of his NINJA FIGURINES that 
           has fallen, and walks out of his room.

                                 DOUG (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I wish I could’ve been a stronger 
                        man. But fuck, do I wish you had 
                        been a better woman. Doug.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Doug turns on the shower and rifles through his pockets 
           pulling out a bottle with NO LABELS on it, just a smiley 
           face written on the cap in Sharpie. Shaking a couple 
           pills out, he swallows them dry, snapping his head back 
           to get them down.
           He turns on the shower radio on the counter, whirring 
           through stations until he lands on “She’s Always A Woman” 
           by Billy Joel.

                                 DOUG (PRE-LAP)
                        (singing) “But she’ll bring out 
                        the best and the worst you can be, 
                        blame it all on yourself cause 
                        she’s always a woman to me.”

           Again, like he likes to do, he SITS DOWN IN THE TUB and 
           lets the shower head blast him with hot water, the drugs 
           taking effect. He looks complacent, happy, and relaxed as 
           he SINGS ALONG WITH THE EASY LISTENING HIT. 

           So fucked up on meds and relaxed that his eyelids grow 
           heavy, he dozes off. The shower continuing to pelt him 
           with water, he does not even wake when a WASH CLOTH 
           slides off the rim of the tub and CLOGS THE DRAIN.

           It isn’t long before the water in the tub begins to fill 
           up, reaching Doug’s chest...Yet he does not wake. The 
           water continues to rise, rise, rise, until DOUG’S FACE is 
           completely submerged...HE IS GOING TO DROWN.

           As we pan overhead, we look down into the tub and see, 
           looking up at us, the WIDE-EYED, BLOATED CORPSE OF JACK 
           ROBERTS.

                                 DOUG (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        Ahhh!

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN

           Wrapped in a blanket, face covered in Oreo crumbs, Doug 
           sits up THE COUCH...where he dozed off IN A DRUNKEN 
           STUPOR. It was all a BAD DREAM.

           He takes big gulps of air in disbelief. ON THE TV is a 
           Discovery Channel Program about Hummingbirds. He 
           considers it a second before flipping the TV off and 
           taking a glance at the CLOCK it reads: 5:17 AM.

                                 DOUG
                        What the fuck am I doing?

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER - EARLY MORNING

           Dressed now, ready for work, Doug flies in only to grab a 
           soda out of the fridge...

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        Dad?
                                 DOUG
                        (startled) Hey. Just heading in to 
                        work. Early bird and all that.

                                 ETHAN
                        Store doesn’t open for another 
                        hour. 

                                 DOUG
                        Oh. Yeah. Well we’ve got a big 
                        shipment of Summer’s Eve coming in 
                        and--

                                 ETHAN
                        --But you’re still coming to 
                        school today, right?

                                 DOUG
                        (Clearly forgot) Of course. Right. 
                        Wouldn’t miss it for the world.

           As Doug leaves WE RACK FOCUS ON THE FRIDGE, where we see 
           the SMILING BUDDHA of the Lum Chin’s stationery stuck on 
           the refrigerator with a magnet.

           EXT. DOUG’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Racing outside, fumbling with his keys, Doug stops short 
           as he sees that HIS CAR IS PULLED UP INTO THE YARD where 
           he left it a few hours earlier, drunk. 

           He gets in, revs it, and CHEWS UP MORE OF THE YARD...

           INT. DOUG’S PRIUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Doug “floors” his Prius, it lets out a whispering buzz as 
           he tears through the streets of Woodbury. Looks like it 
           RAINED LAST NIGHT. He dials his cell phone...after a few 
           rings we hear, “You’ve reached the voicemail for 
           Elizabeth Roberts. Please leave a message.” 

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, it’s me. Abort. Abort the 
                        mission. We shouldn’t do this. We 
                        can’t...I can’t. Call me back.

           EXT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Winding up the curvy driveway, Doug screeches to a halt 
           right out front, hops from the car and barrels up the 
           steps to the front door. RINGING the bell...then again a 
           few seconds later....then just starts knocking.

           The only response is the faint, muffled barking of the 
           GERMAN SHEPHERDS.
                                 DOUG
                        Shit.

           Breaking into a light jog, Doug heads AROUND BACK...

           Craning his neck, looking in the windows, he finally 
           makes it to the HUGE FRENCH DOORS that let into the 
           living room. Placing his face up against the glass with 
           his hands to block the glare he sees The GIANT PORTRAIT 
           of Liz & Jack...open bottle of scotch...JACK’S ARM 
           dangling off the side of the couch, being pulled down by 
           the weight of his giant ROLEX. Motionless.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Oh, fuck....fuck!

           Doug’s lip quivers, he BANGS ON THE GLASS trying to stir 
           Jack, but he’s not moving. Doug starts crying. Through 
           his tears, he mumbles...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        I killed him. I fucking killed 
                        him.

           But is soon interrupted by a LOW GROWL. TWO low growls 
           actually...coming from The German Shepherds, doggie door 
           swinging behind them in the background. They look furious 
           with Doug...

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Easy, fellas. Easy...

           BARK...BARK, BARK, BARK, BARK...alternating, their 
           vicious, snapping barks make us jump.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Easy...easy...easy...

           After a beat...DOUG RUNS, sprinting for all he’s worth 
           through the rain as the dogs give chase.

           EXT. DOUG’S PRIUS - MOMENTS LATER

           WE HOLD ON a static shot of the car as we hear motion off 
           screen...then the BEEP BEEP of the car unlocking...then 
           Doug RACES into view, opens the door, hops into the car, 
           and SLAMS the door.

           He has just a millisecond to breathe heavily before the 
           two huge dogs SLAM INTO HIS DOOR, barking loudly, their 
           drooling snouts and slimy paws smearing up the window...
           INT. DOUG’S PRIUS - CONTINUOUS

           Gasping for breath, Doug floors the car through 
           Elizabeth’s high end neighborhood leaving the dogs 
           behind. He tries to hold onto his cell phone with one 
           hand while driving. We hear a ringing...ringing. Then a 
           message, again. “You’ve reached Elizabeth Roberts. Please 
           leave a message.”

                                 DOUG
                        (whispering for no reason) Hey. 
                        It’s me. Where are you?! Call me 
                        when you get this. Seriously. 
                        I...I killed him. I really killed 
                        him--SHIT!

           The phone clatters to the floorboard as a FAMILY OF DUCKS 
           crosses in front of the Prius. Doug takes evasive action 
           to avoid them, and loses control as the car begins to 
           hydroplane. 

           He over-corrects and we see the car begin to spin, 
           avoiding the scattering deer, and BOOM. The horrible 
           sound of crunching metal as Doug crashes into a STURDY 
           TELEPHONE POLE. EVERYTHING GOES BLACK...

           INT. PRIUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Doug opens his eyes to see the ENTIRE FRONT END crumpled, 
           SMOKE pouring from the hood. The engine refuses to turn 
           over, and Doug ANGRILY POUNDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL. 
           Finally, he looks in the rearview mirror...we RACK FOCUS 
           allowing us to see the HIGH PERFORMANCE BIKE still 
           clipped to the back, the RED CLIP-ON LIGHT BLINKING.

           EXT. WOODBURY STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           NOW ON BIKE, lab coat flapping in the wind, Doug rides 
           like a bat out of hell...and we begin to hear kids’ 
           voices reciting the PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, catching us up 
           to THE MOMENT WE MET HIM IN THE OPENING FRAMES...

           As he gets closer to the school, carpool minivans start 
           to WHIZZ PAST HIM. Checking his watch, he starts to pedal 
           even harder but LOSES HIS FOOTING. His SMOOTH BOTTOM 
           LOAFERS slip off the “clip-in” pedals causing the bike to 
           wobble violently which sends Doug tumbling to the ground 
           and eating shit. Hard.

           Surveying the damage, his pants are ripped and his knee 
           is badly skinned. He looks up to find that he’s right 
           outside Bishop’s, the damaged sign still hanging 
           overhead.
           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

           Doug limps inside, pops whatever pills he had on him, and 
           heads down an aisle and arriving at the Bacteen. He grabs 
           a package and tears it open, readies himself, and SPRAYS 
           THE BACTEEN on his knee.

                                 DOUG
                        AAAH! Motherfuck that stings.

           He throws the bottle aside and heads back for the door, 
           dialing his phone. A ring, and then a different message.

                                 PHONE MESSAGE (V.O.)
                        We’re sorry, this phone number has 
                        been disconnected. If you think 
                        you’ve reached this number in 
                        error, hang up and dial again.

           We can almost hear Doug’s stomach turn as he starts to 
           feel very, very nervous. He clicks off the phone just as 
           the Dr. Scholl’s display falls over, AGAIN, causing him 
           to trip and fall, RE-INJURING his freshly bandaged knee. 
           Doug considers the display, then proceeds to JUMP UP AND 
           DOWN ON IT. Kicking, shredding, tearing it to pieces.

           EXT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

           Doug emerges from the BACK DOOR and mounts his bike, 
           gingerly pedaling off down the street. Behind him, 
           amongst all the parked cars, we barely notice Noah’s Kia
           Sportage, CLUMSILY PARKED UP ON THE CURB, door ajar.

           EXT. WOODBURY MIDDLE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Doug skids to a stop at the bike rack, tossing his Trek 
           to the ground next to all the Kids’ bikes...

                                 MISS D’FRANCESCO (PRE-LAP)
                        Come on, people. Let’s show Mr. 
                        Varney a little respect.

           INT. WOODBURY MIDDLE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Doug stands at the front of the room, sweaty and 
           disheveled. We’ve caught up to our opening scene.

           The class quiets down, when we hear...

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        You’re bleeding.
           Looking down, we see Doug is in fact bleeding. A steady 
           trickle of blood oozes from his MAKESHIFT BANDAGE and 
           stains his torn pant leg. He moves to touch it 
           when...BOOM! 

           The CLASSROOM DOOR is flung open, startling Doug and the 
           kids. An angry OFFICER WILLITS storms into the room.

                                 OFFICER WILLITS
                        Douglas Varney, you’re under 
                        arrest.

                                 DOUG
                        Wait, hold on a second...

           He grimaces as the Officer grabs his arm and twists it 
           behind his back, controlling him.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Jesus--

                                 OFFICER WILLITS
                        --Hands on your head, now!

           Unnerved as he’s violently shoved onto the desk knocking 
           over a cup of coffee, Doug’s head is pinned down by a 
           nightstick...

                                 DOUG
                        Hey! Take it easy, man--

                                 OFFICER WILLITS
                        --You have the right to remain 
                        silent. Anything you say can and 
                        will be used against you in a 
                        court of law.

           Officer Willits KICKS HIS FEET OUT FROM UNDER HIM, 
           dropping him to the floor, slapping on cuffs with 
           lightning quick efficiency. The kids are awestruck.

                                 OFFICER WILLITS (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand these rights as 
                        I’ve just read them to you?

           Now hog-tied, Doug can only lay there and submit, face 
           inches from a piece of FLATTENED OLD GUM, as Officer 
           Willits finishes reading him his Miranda Rights. All 
           sounds BLEED OUT SILENT, Doug’s eyes close and he looks 
           peaceful, as though accepting his fate behind bars.

           A beat, and then...APPLAUSE. He opens his eyes to find 
           the cop SMILING and the teacher clapping.

                                 MISS D’FRANCESCO
                        Let’s everyone give a big hand for 
                        Kristopher’s father, Officer 
                        Willits!
                                 OFFICER WILLITS
                        (to Doug) Great stuff, man.

           THE KIDS GO CRAZY, clapping. He may lack a college 
           education, but Officer Willits is very popular with the 
           pre-pubescent set. Especially standing next to Doug, 
           who’s quite a sight to see with his wet hair sticking up 
           everywhere and bloody knee.

                                 OFFICER WILLITS (CONT’D)
                        Alright, alright. But being a 
                        police officer is more than just 
                        kicking ass, car chases, and 
                        guns...

           He quickly brandishes his .9mm GLOCK drawing “oohs” from 
           the kids, before holstering it again.

                                 OFFICER WILLITS (CONT’D)
                        It’s protecting and serving the 
                        community. It’s making sure that 
                        Woodbury remains a safe community 
                        for all of you to work and play--

           He’s interrupted as his WALKIE-TALKIE SQUAWKS to life. He 
           suddenly gets very serious.

                                 OFFICER WILLITS (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me for a second.

           Officer Willits STEPS OUTSIDE the room for a second, 
           talking on his radio. After a beat, Willits LOOKS UP AT 
           DOUG, and meets his gaze with his asshole cop eyes. We 
           hear the radio beep off, and Willits re-enters, looking 
           serious.

                                 OFFICER WILLITS (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to need you to come with 
                        me, Doug.

           EXT. BISHOP’S RX - DAY - LATER

           There are an additional three Police Cruisers parked out 
           front, lights flashing, the officers sealing off the area 
           with yellow crime scene tape. It’s quite a scene, which 
           would explain the crowd...or audience, depending on how 
           you look at it.

                                 OFFICER WILLITS (O.S.)
                        Check it out, Varney. You’re 
                        famous.

           Officer Willits parks his cruiser, lets Doug out of the 
           back, and escorts him through the melee - he can feel 
           every set of eyes on him.
           INT. BISHOP’S RX - CONTINUOUS

           Doug steps inside to find even more law enforcement 
           picking through the store, bagging evidence, etc...

                                 DOUG
                        Janet?

           She’s seated in the corner, GENTLY CRYING by herself...

                                 AGENT CARP (O.S.)
                        Mr. Varney.

                                 DOUG
                        Yes.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        For Christ’s--can we get these 
                        cuffs off him, please?

           Willits obliges...

                                 AGENT CARP (CONT’D)
                        Little unnecessary, if you ask me.

                                 DOUG
                        Really?

                                 AGENT CARP
                        None of this should come as a 
                        surprise to you, given the 
                        inconsistent state of affairs 
                        around here. 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m aware.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        With a paper trail as thick as 
                        this one, it was only a matter of 
                        time, Mr. Varney. It’s usually how 
                        these things work out.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Don’t apologize. It’s over now.

           It’s then that the CORONERS make their way in pushing a 
           gurney, deflated BODY BAG soon to be filled, on top.

                                 DOUG
                        What are they doing here?

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Mr. Varney...to remove the body.
                                 DOUG
                        How the fuck did he get here from 
                        his house!?!

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Well, he probably panicked. And, 
                        being as how there weren’t any 
                        doctor’s offices nearby, he did 
                        the next best thing and came here. 
                        So, this is where he expired. 

           Doug’s head is spinning. He looks like he might throw up, 
           or cry, or both...

                                 AGENT CARP (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay, Mr. Varney?

           Doug is cracking up...it’s then he pushes his way past 
           Carp and into the storage area after the Corners...

                                 AGENT CARP (CONT’D)
                        Hold on, wait!

           INT. BISHOP’S RX - STORAGE AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Doug bursts in to find a Crime Scene Unit tagging and 
           dusting the area. He pushes through the throng before 
           they can stop him, until he sees it...

                                 DOUG
                        (beat) What the fuck?

           Lying on the floor, contorted and pale as a sheet, with 
           dried vomit on his face and chest...IS NOAH. Dead as a 
           doornail. Doug’s world just got even more turned around.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        He was no angel, a few 
                        misdemeanors here and there, even 
                        brought up on a B&E charge that 
                        didn’t stick, but he got in over 
                        his head with this one.

                                 DOUG
                        With...with what?

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Pilfering. Pill skimming. One 
                        here, two there, the kind of thing 
                        that adds up in a hurry. Too quick 
                        sometimes. There’s a real cottage 
                        industry for this stuff out here 
                        in the ‘burbs. Guess he got high 
                        on his own supply. (then) Noah 
                        Rayburn pulled a fast one on you, 
                        Mr. Varney. But you shouldn’t feel 
                        bad. 
                        This was the third pharmacy he’d 
                        worked at in the last two years. 

           Noah was a shithead, but he looks very scared and 
           innocent lying there. He’s soon ZIPPED UP in the BODY BAG 
           and rolled away...Doug is numb. 

                                 DOUG
                        But...but he was a moron.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        On the contrary, junkies like him 
                        are often remarkably clever. He 
                        was probably ripping them off, 
                        too. Anyway, we’ll have this area 
                        cleared out shortly.

                                 DOUG
                        So, that’s it then?

                                 AGENT CARP
                        As far as the DEA is concerned, 
                        between the stiff, the pill cache 
                        in his apartment and a toxicology 
                        report that will no doubt read 
                        like the periodic table - it’ll be 
                        hard to isolate which of these 
                        meds killed him - this case is 
                        closed. Just some minor paper work 
                        for you to sign and we’re done 
                        here.

           Doug is in shock and Carp knows it, which is why he 
           breaks character for a minute and puts his hand on Doug’s 
           shoulder.

                                 AGENT CARP (CONT’D)
                        Listen, Doug, I know it’s tough. 
                        But this kid was a royal fuck-up 
                        and something like this was bound 
                        to happen sooner or later. There’s 
                        nothing you could’ve done to stop 
                        it.

           Officer Willits comes by and gives Doug a friendly chuck 
           on the shoulder.

                                 OFFICER WILLITS
                        Heh, from the looks of things you 
                        oughta prescribe yourself a little 
                        something to take the edge off. 

           Carp rolls his eyes behind Willits’s back.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        Local cops. (then) But he’s 
                        probably right. Go ahead. 
                        It’ll be our little secret. You 
                        take care, Doug.

           And he heads for the door, whistling. Doug takes a deep 
           breath. 

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        Agent Carp, wait!

           Agent Carp and Officer Willets both turn back towards 
           Doug. In the background, we hear the JINGLE announcing an 
           entering customer.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        I...uh. I need to tell you 
                        something. I need to conf--

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        --Pardon me, but where can I find 
                        the advil?

           Doug turns to find JACK ROBERTS, live and in the flesh, 
           staring at him. Hair mussed, worse for wear, but alive.

                                 JACK
                        Hey! Drinking buddy!

                                 DOUG
                        You’re not supposed to be here.

                                 JACK
                        I know, I know. Called in sick. 
                        First time since...well, it’s been 
                        a while since I’ve taken a 
                        personal day. After the drinks we 
                        had at the bar I went home and 
                        kept the party going by myself. 3 
                        egg rolls, some lo mein, and a 
                        bottle of Blue Label later I 
                        passed out cold right there on the 
                        couch. Probably why it feels like 
                        my head is in a vice right now.

           Jack laughs, but stops, his head aching badly. Doug 
           reaches over to a shelf and plucks off a box of Advil, 
           handing it to him...still in disbelief.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Thanks. (then) Oh, I should 
                        probably also pick up my 
                        prescription while I’m here. 
                        Delivery guy never made it up to 
                        the house last night.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah. We had an incident here, a 
                        lot of orders got screwed up. 
                        I’ll get it filled and have 
                        someone run it over to you later.

                                 JACK
                        How much do I owe you?

                                 DOUG
                        Call it even...for the drinks.

                                 JACK
                        Thanks.

           Jack shakes his hand then turns to leave, when...

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        Everything else okay?

                                 JACK
                        I’m sorry?

                                 DOUG
                        You know, with your wife. What you 
                        were telling me at the bar...

                                 JACK
                        Hard to tell, she left me.

                                 DOUG
                        And...she’s not coming back?

                                 JACK
                        We’ll see. We’ve played this game 
                        before; I get drunk and say some 
                        things, she cries and says even 
                        worse things, then leaves. Then I 
                        start talking fast and can usually 
                        catch her, but this time I wasn’t 
                        fast enough. Even shut off her 
                        cell phone, so maybe she’s for 
                        real this time. Who knows, maybe 
                        it’s for the best.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah. Maybe. 

                                 JACK
                        Anyhow, we can get into it over a 
                        couple of drinks at Lum Chin’s 
                        sometime.

                                 DOUG
                        Sure thing.

           Jack leaves. Doug breathes a sigh of relief, when...

                                 AGENT CARP (O.S.)
                        Doug, you wanted to tell us 
                        something?
                                 DOUG
                        I was saying...oh, yeah. Thanks. I 
                        wanted to say thanks for all your 
                        help.

                                 AGENT CARP
                        We all do our part to keep the 
                        world turning, Doug. You take care 
                        now. 

           As they exit, Doug walks back into the storage room. Sits 
           down in a folding chair and stares at the floor where 
           Noah’s body lay. 

           For the first time, we notice how haggard Doug looks. A 
           couple weeks of popping pills, an affair, and plotting to 
           kill someone will sure take it out of you. 

           Instinctively, he pulls out a PILL BOTTLE and is about to 
           open it, but doesn’t. He throws it in the trash. 

           TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY shows the crowd of Police 
           Officials and city workers thinning out, until it’s JUST 
           DOUG LEFT ALONE. Exhausted, he shuts his eyes.

                                                            FADE TO BLACK.

           THE BUZZING/RINGING OF A CELLPHONE FADES US BACK INTO...

           INT. BISHOP’S PHARMACY - STORE ROOM - DAWN

           DOUG IS STILL ASLEEP, hair now mussed and a line of drool 
           dripping from the corner of his mouth. Everyone is gone, 
           as he’s been sleeping FOR HOURS.

           Taking a moment to collect his bearings, he looks down at 
           his watch. It’s almost 6 am.

                                 DOUG
                        The fuck?

           Then looks at the phone, expecting it to be Kara, but it 
           says UNKNOWN CALLER.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                        Hey, baby.

                                 DOUG
                        Elizabeth? Where the fuck...you 
                        haven’t answered calls--

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                        --That was the plan, darling. We 
                        said no calls, remember?
           EXT. QUAINT SMALL TOWN SHOPPING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSEUP on Elizabeth, attractive as ever in a designer 
           suit and $500 sunglasses. She stands inside an old-timey
           PHONE BOOTH with a finger in her other ear.

                                 ELIZABETH 
                        You have no idea what kind of a 
                        bitch it is to find a pay phone 
                        these days.

                                 DOUG
                        You in the Hamptons?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes. It’s freezing. Is it always 
                        so cold this time of year?

                                 DOUG
                        I’m not a meterologist, Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Of course you aren’t. You’re the 
                        pharmacist. The man with the plan.

                                 DOUG
                        Well, the plan has changed. Jack 
                        isn’t dead.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What? Why? Doug--

                                 DOUG
                        --There was a screw up with his 
                        delivery. Noah...it’s complicated.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Jesus. It was so simple. How could 
                        you fuck this up, Doug?!

                                 DOUG
                        Me? Me!?! It takes two to make a 
                        conspiracy, sweetheart. Maybe I 
                        should call the cops and let them 
                        sort it all out?

           She holds up her iPhone to the receiver and presses a 
           button. We hear snippets of Doug from earlier. “Abort 
           this mission,” and “I killed him! I really killed him!”

                                 ELIZABETH
                        As long as I have Doug Varney’s
                        greatest hits on tape, you’re not 
                        going to do anything.

                                 DOUG
                        You wouldn’t dare!?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Really? Go ahead and try me!

           There’s a beat...

                                 DOUG
                        Why are we fighting?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t know. (then) I don’t know. 

           A BEAT, as a shaky Elizabeth lights up a cigarette.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I’m not cut out for this...

                                 DOUG
                        Bonnie and Clyde we are not.

           Elizabeth chuckles, but it turns into a choked sob. She 
           collects herself.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s not too late, you know. We 
                        could still just go away--

                                 DOUG
                        --I have a kid, Elizabeth. I can’t 
                        leave.

           There’s AN EXTENDED BEAT. Disappointment and reality 
           washing over both of them. Elizabeth looks down, gently 
           spinning the MAMMOTH DIAMOND RING her husband gave her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So...so, what do we do?

           EXT. DOUG’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           The rain has finally stopped. Everything is glistening 
           with moisture, but the SUN SHINES BRIGHTLY.

           Doug walks down his street, still limping slightly from 
           the bike accident. 

                                 KID’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        On your left!

           A HIPSTER TEENAGER on a FIXED GEAR touring bike zips past 
           him, tossing a newspaper that lands on Doug’s porch.

           INT. DOUG’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Doug shuffles inside and goes to the fridge and drinks 
           some OJ straight from the carton. When he closes the 
           fridge door, we reveal KARA to be standing right there.
           She waits a beat...before wrapping Doug up in a HUGE HUG.

                                 KARA
                        God, I was worried sick. 

                                 DOUG
                        (cold, clipped) I’m fine.

                                 KARA
                        And then, this...

           She HOLDS UP HIS LETTER. Doug just stares.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        You were right. About all of it. 
                        And I’m sorry. I had no idea 
                        that’s how you felt. I’ve been so 
                        caught up in...in well, the new 
                        studio, Ethan’s BS. But listen, I 
                        promise to do my best to make some 
                        changes. But for now, you’re home, 
                        and that’s what’s important.

           Doug calmly removes himself from her clutches.

                                 DOUG
                        I forgot to pack a bag.

                                 KARA
                        What?

                                 DOUG
                        Kara, that letter wasn’t me asking 
                        you to change. It was me telling 
                        you that I’m leaving.

           Kara throws her hands on her hips, reverting back to her 
           callous side in a heartbeat.

                                 KARA
                        Your theatrics are not lost on me, 
                        Doug. Bravo. But, really...I’m 
                        supposed to stand here and believe 
                        that you’re leaving me? 

           Doug takes another sip of the OJ, then puts it back in 
           the fridge.

                                 DOUG
                        Yes. Yes I am.

           He pats her on the top of the head like she’s five, and 
           walks out. We hear THE DOOR OPEN then slam shut, while 
           Kara remains standing there, motionless.

                                 MAN’S VOICES (PRE-LAP)
                        Bow to your sensei. Bow to your 
                        opponent...
           INT. KARATE DOJO - A FEW WEEKS LATER

           CLOSE ON AN EMBROIDERED GI that reads “David Chen.” 
           Pulling back, we see that he’s about to square off 
           against ETHAN. He appears to have lost some weight, 
           indicating that time has passed. More importantly, he 
           looks focused and, from his knowing smile, HAPPY.

           Their sensei holds up his hand and indicates for them to 
           “Fight!” After a brief exchange, Ethan executes a perfect 
           combination, dropping David Chen to the mat. 

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        Hell yeah!!

           Doug explodes out of his seat pumping his fist, startling 
           the other parents...including Kara, who sits several rows 
           below and down from Doug.

           EXT. LUM CHINS RESTAURANT - EVENING

           His repaired Prius, with Ethan riding shotgun and holding 
           his YELLOW BELT, pulls into the lot...

           INT. LUM CHINS RESTAURANT - MAITRE’D STAND - CONTINUOUS

           As Doug waits, the cashier sifts through the MANY TO-GO 
           ORDERS. Doug grabs a fortune cookie out of a jar. He 
           cracks it open, and eats it while he reads...

           ON FORTUNE: “The secret of getting ahead is getting 
           started.”

           Doug smiles, rolls the fortune into a ball, and flicks it 
           into the trash before hearing a HORRIBLE LAUGH...

           AT A TABLE INSIDE - Kara, Walter, and Bree sit together - 
           Bree pantomiming another lame scene for their 
           entertainment - as Doug and Kara make eye contact. He 
           gives her a sarcastic thumbs-up and she turns away.

           Doug grabs the bag of to-go food...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Doug. 

           AT THE BAR AREA sits Jack. Alone.

                                 JACK
                        Howabout that drink?

                                 DOUG
                        Maybe some other time.
           EXT. WOODBURY STREETS - MORNING 

           It’s a chilly morning as Doug emerges from a CONVERTED 
           LOFT APARTMENT and crosses the street towards his place 
           of business. He arrives to find Walter standing there, 
           holding out a cup of coffee.

                                 DOUG
                        No thanks, Walt. I’m off caffeine.

           Walter looks awkward holding an extra cup of coffee, just 
           as Doug once did.

                                 WALTER
                        Big day.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, I guess it is.

           Off screen we hear a LOUD WINCHING NOISE and we track 
           over to see Rick Scruggs operating a piece of heavy 
           machinery and lifting a new sign into place. Following 
           the crane up, we see that the sign says...

                 VARNEY’S Rx, in a handsome Art Deco style.

                                 WALTER
                        Funny. I don’t hate it as much as 
                        I thought I would.

                                 DOUG
                        Funny. I really don’t care.

           INT. VARNEY’S - CONTINUOUS

           A little cowed, Walter follows his son in law into his 
           redone store. It seems brighter, friendlier, less 
           clinical. 

           He and Walter end up in front of a HUMONGOUS DISPLAY OF 
           FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS, where we see a GRAY-HAIRED 
           WOMAN comparing items. 

                                 DOUG
                        Ma’am, are you finding everything 
                        alright?

           As the woman turns and we see that she’s none other than 
           DAME JUDI DENCH, in the flesh. She looks at Doug, then 
           Walter, then Janet, even Bree off to the side, SIZING 
           THEM UP...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        Yes, I am. And, may I just say, 
                        this pharmacy has the most 
                        impressive collection of douches 
                        I’ve ever seen. 
           Tucking her purchase under her arm, she heads for the 
           checkout as Walter looks at Doug with a raised eyebrow.

                                 DOUG
                        High blood pressure. Acid reflux. 
                        (hushed) Chlamydia.

                                 WALTER
                        Would never have guessed.

                                 DOUG
                        No one ever does.

           He and Walt share a look: the look that comes from 
           knowing these kinds of secrets. Janet pokes around the 
           aisle, dressed in a VARNEY’s Rx SHIRT, far more 
           professional than ever before.

                                 JANET 
                        Doug. There’s a woman, says she 
                        needs your help with something.

           INT. VARNEY’S PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

           Doug swings around the aisles, when he stops cold...it’s 
           ELIZABETH. Dressed down, but still looking very good.

                                 DOUG
                        I thought you--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --Had to come back to sign a few 
                        papers. Make it final. And of 
                        course, you know, there were a few 
                        things I absolutely needed to pick 
                        up from the pharmacy.

           Doug, sinks a bit...until she HOISTS UP TWO LITTLE 
           FIGURINES that we saw in the case earlier. We notice that 
           her ring is LONG GONE.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Had to complete the set.

           The tension between them breaks with a shared laugh.

                                 DOUG
                        (wanna go out) So. Uh, are you 
                        going to be in town long, or--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        --I leave tonight. Madrid. Then 
                        Paris. Then, I’m not really sure. 
                        I don’t really care, so long as I 
                        don’t understand the menu. 
                                 DOUG
                        Oh. OK. That sounds great--

           Then she leans in and KISSES DOUG before he can finish, 
           echoing their first kiss, but this time with real intent. 
           With meaning. Saying goodbye. Over this...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        You can’t help everybody. But 
                        everybody can help someone.

           She breaks the kiss off, leaving Doug a little wanting.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Take care of yourself, Doug.

           She turns and walks out...Doug watches her go. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O)
                        And sometimes that someone is 
                        yourself. 

                                 DOUG
                        You too.

           The door jingles one last time, as it shuts behind her.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        Douglas Varney wasn’t used to 
                        winning...

           Doug takes a long, satisfied look at his new domain, 
           running the way he wants it to. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...but he was beginning to enjoy 
                        how it felt.

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        Consult!!

                                                            SNAP TO BLACK.
