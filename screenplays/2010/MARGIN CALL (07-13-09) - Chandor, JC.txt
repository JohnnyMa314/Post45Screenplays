           TITLE CARDS - OVER A BLACK SCREEN INTERCUT WITH:

           The voices of RADIO ANNOUNCER #1 and #2 are somber and 
           monotonous. This is from a business radio network. The first 
           time the voices are heard, the blackness with the first title 
           card HARD CUTS TO:

           INT. NEW YORK FEDERAL RESERVE BANK, GOLD VAULT

           The frame fills with a locked-off shot of a massive warehouse-
           looking vault with fifteen foot high shelves filled with 
           brilliant gold bars as far as the eye can see. The brilliance 
           of the gold contrasted with the title cards over black is 
           shocking. This cutting/contrast goes back and forth through 
           the sequence. At the last shot in the sequence, we are again 
           in the vault. An automated robotic forklift comes into frame, 
           empty, drives over to a shelf, and picks up a pallet of gold 
           bars. It backs up, then slowly drives away down a long row, 
           slowly receding.  

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER #1(V/O)
                        ...the time is 4:28 and with just under 
                        two minutes left in the trading day it 
                        appears as if we are heading for a four 
                        hundred point gain... on a day where we 
                        saw wild market swings of over 900 
                        hundred points it’s hard to know what to 
                        make of it?

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER #2 (V/O)
                        Tom, it does start to get a little 
                        unsettling. Although obviously the street 
                        liked what it heard coming out of 
                        Goldstone today.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER #1
                        Yes... let’s see here... it was 2:30 when 
                        they announced the 5000 job cuts, or over 
                        ten percent of the work force, and we got 
                        a six hundred point bounce from 2:30 on.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER #2
                        Are they starting the paring down process 
                        immediately Tom?

                        Apparently.
                          (BELL RINGS in the Background)
                        And there’s the bell.

                                                                FADE IN:

           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR

           The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27-
           year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT 
           and is staring intently into a large bank of computer 
           screens. 

           An elevator door opens and TEN HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come 
           out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down 
           a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of 
           the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into 
           frame. It is massive. There are more computers than can be 
           imagined and several large boards on the far walls that are 
           scrolling thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance 
           to the guy sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst 
           in his early twenties.

                                 SETH
                        Is that them?

                                 PETER
                        (nods yes)

                                 SETH
                        Jesus Christ.

           The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into four large 
           glass walled conference rooms that run along the floor as 
           almost every person on the floor watches.

                                 SETH (cont’d)
                        Are they going to do it right there?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.

                                 SETH
                        Fuck me.

           TOM WILSON, another guy sitting next to them leans back in 
           his chair.

                                 TOM
                          (whispered)
                        Have you guys ever seen this before?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SETH
                        No.

                                 TOM
                        Oh fuck... it’s better to just ignore it. 
                        Keep your head down... and don’t watch.

                                 SETH
                        Fuck.

                                 TOM
                        Good Luck. 

           The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a 
           piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person 
           and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one 
           HR WOMAN with her piece of paper down the hall and into a row 
           of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS then stops 
           a bit down from them. 

                                 HR WOMAN
                        Timothy Singh?

                                 TIMOTHY
                        Yes.

                                 HR WOMAN
                        I’m afraid we have to speak with you.

           TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with 
           the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP 
           MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost 
           back into the numbers on his computer screen. 

           The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing 
           people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer 
           screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until 
           finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and 
           stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off 
           his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shellshocked.

                                 HR WOMAN (cont’d)
                        Eric Dale?

                                 PETER
                        Excuse me?

                                 HR WOMAN
                        Eric Dale?

                                 PETER
                        No.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 HR WOMAN
                        Sorry?

                                 PETER
                        I’m not Eric Dale.

                                 HR WOMAN
                        Oh. I’m so sorry.

                                 PETER
                        He’s my boss, he’s behind you.

           They both turn around and look into the office that is behind 
           them. ERIC DALE is sitting at his desk, he is 43 years old 
           and looks exhausted. He looks out through the glass of his 
           office as she walks over to the door. 

                                 HR WOMAN
                        Mr. Dale?

                                 ERIC 
                        Yes.

                                 HR WOMAN
                        This way.

           ERIC walks out the door first and they walk along the full 
           length of the trading floor to reach one of the conference 
           rooms. Everyone left on the floor is watching.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM 

           There is a more senior looking Human Resources lawyer, LAUREN 
           BRATBERG, already sitting at the table. They all sit and look 
           at each other for a beat.

                                 LAUREN BRATBERG
                        Well... Mr. Dale I’m obviously sorry that 
                        we are here today but these are extra 
                        ordinary times as you very well must 
                        know.

                                 ERIC
                        I run risk management... it just doesn’t 
                        seem like a natural place to start 
                        cutting.

                                 HR WOMAN
                        I hope you understand that this is in no 
                        way personal. Seventy percent of this 
                        floor is being let go today.

           LAUREN BRATBERG slides across the table a very thick 
           severance contract agreement.

                        Mr. Dale the firm is offering you six

                        will keep all unvested options that you

                        highly sensitive nature of your work here 
                        the firm has to take certain precautions

           They all stare at each other in silence for several long

           ERIC walks into the office and sits at his desk and begins to

                        I’m very sorry.

                                 ERIC
                        Are you still alive?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        For now.

                                 ERIC
                        Congratulations. 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        It’s a total bloodbath. 

                                 ERIC
                        I heard.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        If there was anything I could have done, 
                        you know I...

                                 ERIC
                        I know.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Well...

                                 ERIC
                        One more thing... Who was it?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Eric...

                                 ERIC
                        Was it Rogers?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        You know...

                                 ERIC
                        Robertson?

           WILL EMERSON just looks back at him in silence.

                                 ERIC (cont’d)
                        That cunt. I knew it. I never should have 
                        gone to her last year. 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Look it wasn’t anyone. It’s just bad 
                        luck. Right....?

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Good luck.

           They look at each other with respect but do not shake hands 
           as WILL EMERSON starts to leave the office.

                                 ERIC
                        Will?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Yeah.

                                 ERIC
                        You know I was just in the middle of a 
                        bunch of shit here that someone should 
                        really take a look at. 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Eric, they are telling us that everyone 
                        has got to get out of here and leave 
                        everything behind. I appreciate the 
                        concern, but it’s not your problem 
                        anymore.

           ERIC looks straight ahead as WILL leaves the office. He packs 
           up a few more things then stands and gets ready to walk out. 
           He looks around and heads out into the main trading area. 
           Outside his office PETER and SETH are standing to say 
           goodbye. 

                                 PETER
                        Eric, I am very sorry.

                                 SETH
                        Yeah. Did they say what was going to 
                        happen with us?

                                 PETER
                        Jesus Seth.

                                 SETH
                        What?

                                 ERIC
                        No, it will be ugly around here for a 
                        while but you guys will be fine... Well, 
                        I’ll be seeing you around.

           ERIC turns and begins to walk out towards the elevator, SETH 
           stays behind but PETER walks out with him. 
           INT. LARGE ELEVATOR BANK 

           THEY both stand there in silence waiting for the elevator, 
           then. 

                                 PETER
                        I just wanted to say thank you.  

                                 ERIC
                        That’s not neccessary.

                                 PETER
                        Well it is... and I’m very sorry.

           ERIC looks at him and understands. PETER turns around and 
           begins to walk back toward his desk.

                                 ERIC
                        Peter.

           PETER turns back and ERIC reaches into one of his boxes and 
           takes out a small key chain portable hard drive and hands it 
           to PETER.

                                 ERIC (cont’d)
                        I was close to something here... I was 
                        gonna give it to you guys anyway to take 
                        a look at. I couldn’t quite finish it... 
                        I... See what you can do.

           The elevator doors open and ERIC gets into the elevator. Just 
           as the doors are closing he says...

                                 ERIC (cont’d)
                        Be careful.

           The doors close.

           INT. MEDIUM SIZE CORNER OFFICE OF SAM ROGERS-SAME TIME

           SAM ROGERS, a 63 year old executive, is sitting behind his 
           desk looking out the window. WILL EMERSON gently knocks on 
           the door, enters then sits on the couch. 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        What a fucking nightmare. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        It’s gonna get worse before it gets 
                        better.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Much.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        How are you?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        My dog is dying.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I’m sorry?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Just spoke to the vet, it’s some fucking 
                        tumor on her liver. I’m paying almost a 
                        thousand bucks a day to keep her alive 
                        right now.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Really?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Yeah... and I don’t have a clue what to 
                        do about it.

           They both sit in silence and look out the window.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Well they’re all gone.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        How many do we have left?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Thirty-three.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Make sure everyone is out there, I need 
                        to say something. 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        They are ready for you.

           WILL leaves SAM in his office. SAM looks as if he may not 
           move, then snaps out of it.

           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR

           SAM ROGERS walks out of his office and stands in front of the 
           massive trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 
           people.

           CONTINUED:

           Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast 
           mostly empty space. They all look up in silence at him. Long 
           pause, then SAM’S face begins to glow a bit. His posture 
           straightens, he fills up. He speaks slowly at first then 
           builds. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        You are all still here for a reason... 
                        eighty percent of this floor was just 
                        sent home... forever. We have spent the 
                        last hour saying good-bye... they were 
                        good people and they were good at their 
                        jobs... but you all were better. Now they 
                        are gone. They are not to be thought of 
                        again. This is your opportunity. On every 
                        floor of this building and in every 
                        office from Hong Kong to London the same 
                        thing is happening. Before this is all 
                        done 3 of every seven guys who were 
                        standing between you and your boss’s job 
                        are now gone. That is your opportunity. 
                        I’ve been at this place for thirty-nine 
                        years and let me tell you that this will 
                        not be the last time you go through this. 
                        But you all are survivors... And that is 
                        how this firm over 107 years has always 
                        continued to grow stronger. So hold your 
                        heads high... and get back to work. 

           He looks out at them then turns and heads back into his 
           office and closes the door.

           INT. MEDIUM SIZE CORNER OFFICE OF SAM ROGERS-SAME TIME

           SAM falls into the couch and looks forward in a deflated 
           daze. His eyes no longer believe what he says.

           EXT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK BUILDING/STREET LEVEL

           ERIC DALE walks out the front door carrying the file boxes. 
           There are other people streaming out the door doing the same 
           thing. ERIC stops, turns, and looks up at the building then 
           tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it 
           has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and 
           can’t believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman, 
           SARAH ROBERTSON, serious, classically beautiful and dressed 
           in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into 
           the building. He can’t help himself.

                                 ERIC
                        Robertson!

           SARAH does not respond.

           This time she looks up. When she sees him she debates if she 
           should stop. She does. He slowly moves a little closer to 
           her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his 
           personal belongings in it.

                                 ERIC (cont’d)
                        You shut off my phone???

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Eric... I didn’t do anything.

           They stare at each other.

                                 ERIC
                        Fuck you.

           They look at each other for a longer beat, both a little 
           shocked that ERIC was so openly confrontational. She turns 
           and heads back inside quickly. ERIC drops the phone to the 
           ground and walks away. 

           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR

           Most of the remaining traders are packing up and getting 
           ready to go home or out for the night. PETER is sitting at 
           his desk holding the portable hard drive. SETH is getting 
           ready to leave behind him. PETER stares down at the drive in 
           his hand trying to decide whether to proceed.

                                 SETH

                        Yeah. Just a little freaked out.

                                 SETH
                        You want to get a drink?

                        Be glad, you’re still alive.

                                 PETER
                        I am.

           SETH walks out and PETER puts on his headphones, the MUSIC 
           kicks in again. He picks up the portable hard drive, looks 
           around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. He 
           has four large screens in front of him and as he begins 
           opening window upon window of mathematical models his face 
           begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. The frame 
           is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers 
           flying by. 

                                                               HARD CUT:

           INT. VETERINARIANS OFFICE WAITING ROOM

           SAM ROGERS is sitting on a small chair in the Vet’s office 
           waiting room. There is a woman with a small dog on her lap 
           next to him. He just sits and looks forward. Eventually the 
           nurse comes out.

                                 NURSE
                        Mr. Rogers?

                        Yes.

           INT. SMITHS SMALL NIGHTCLUB- SAME TIME

           In a locked off shot SETH and WILL are sitting on a couch 
           staring forward. Figures cross frame and occasionally another 
           banker in the group stops to refill his drink with one of the 
           three bottles in ice buckets on the table in front of them. 
           They are celebrating, but it seems a little forced.  

           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR

           PETER is still working on the numbers, although his face 
           starts to carry a more serious look. He is now wearing 
           glasses and the numbers on the screen are reflected in them. 
           The numbers finally stop moving on the screen and then he 
           takes his glasses off and rubs his eyes. 

           INT. VETERINARIANS OFFICE ANIMAL VISITATION ROOM- SAME TIME

           SAM is sitting next to the exam table, his dog is on the 
           table lying down very sedated. They both stare forward. 

           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR

           PETER is still in front of his computer, he puts his glasses 
           back on, looks at the screen then quickly picks up the phone 
           and dials. 

                                 PETER
                          (to himself as he dials)
                        Come on, come on.

                                 PETER
                        Fuck.

           PETER hangs up the phone. He looks back at the screen. Then 
           picks up the phone again and dials.

           INT. LARGE ELEVATOR BANK- FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

           The elevator doors open and SETH and WILL get off. They walk 
           through the doors and into the empty main trading floor. The 
           lights are down and there is a cleaning person vacuuming in 
           the far background. They walk over to PETER’S desk.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Hey, look who it is, burning the candle 
                        at both ends. There aren’t anymore cuts 
                        planned though, so you can stop kissing 
                        my ass, honestly  I don’t even understand 
                        what you guys do.

                                 PETER
                        Will, I am so sorry to call you back but 
                        I really think..

                        Don’t worry about it.

                                 SETH
                        Hey.

           WILL is a bit drunk but SETH looks at PETER’S face and 
           realizes something is up.

                                 SETH (cont’d)
                        What’s going on?

                                 PETER
                        Look at this.

           SETH comes around and sits at PETER’S desk.

                                 PETER (cont’d)
                        Eric gave me this file before he left.

                                 SETH
                        Eric?

                                 PETER
                        And he told me he couldn’t quite figure 
                        it out, then the last thing he says as 
                        the doors on the elevator close is ‘be 
                        careful’.

                                 PETER
                        So I’m obviously a little curious. So I 
                        get into it a bit and I realize that all 
                        he was missing was bringing the last 
                        variable down throughout the whole model. 
                        Which kinda amazed me that he didn’t 
                        actually figure that out, but I guess the 
                        forest for the trees or something.

           SETH looks at the screen and starts to scroll through the 
           pages.

                                 SETH
                        What is he doing here?

                                 PETER
                        Go to model four, and it makes more 
                        sense.

                                 SETH
                        Oh.

           WILL is now paying closer attention, standing over their 
           shoulder.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        What is this? 

                                 PETER
                        This is basically everything that 
                        GSMBS... which is us...

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I got that.

                                 PETER
                        Has on their books at any given time. But 
                        what Eric was trying to do here is work 
                        it for levels of volatility that fall 
                        outside the limits of our standard VAR 
                        model.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        What are those levels.

                                 PETER
                        Well it’s a fairly complicated...

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Simplify.

                        How does he not have his own cellphone?

                                 PETER
                        I tried, it’s been turned off.

                        I think I have his home number.

                        You’re going to call his house?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Yes... Do we even know if he’s right?

           WILL looks at PETER and SETH standing in front of his desk.

                                 PETER
                        It seems correct. 

                                 SETH
                        But it is Eric’s model.

                                 PETER
                        That’s true

           The phone starts ringing. We never see Mrs. Dale but we can 
           just make out her responses through the reciever.

                                 MRS. DALE
                        Hello.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Mrs. Dale.

                                 MRS. DALE
                        Yes?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        This is William Emerson from Goldstone.

                                 MRS. DALE
                        Oh yes Mr. Emerson, how are you?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I’m alright, I was wondering if Eric was 
                        there?

                                 MRS. DALE
                        No, he’s not back from from the office 
                        yet. Have you tried his cellphone?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I’m afraid the company is having some 
                        trouble with our phones so his cell isn’t 
                        working.

                                 MRS. DALE
                        Oh. Well...

                        It’s no worry really, but could you be 
                        sure to have him call me as soon as he 
                        gets in, as unfortunately it’s quite 
                        important.

                                 MRS. DALE
                        I certainly will.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Thank you very much, Mrs. Dale.

           Will hangs up the phone.

                        Where the fuck is he?

                        Doesn’t he have like three kids?

                        I’m just saying, would you go home?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I know where he is. You two need to go 
                        get him. 

                                 PETER
                        Now?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Yes.

           Will writes the address on a piece of paper. Hands it to 
           them.

                                 WILL EMERSON (cont’d)
                        There will be a car waiting for you 
                        downstairs. Get him back here.

                                 PETER
                        What are you going to do?

           SAM ROGERS is driving in his car home from the vet trying to 
           stay awake when his Blackberry starts ringing next to him. He 
           looks down at it, then out to the road, then decides to 
           answer.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        It’s 11:00 at night?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I know I’m sorry. I wouldn’t have 
                        called...

                                 SAM ROGERS

                        I think you need to get down here.

                        What?

           INT. BACKSEAT OF A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR

           SETH and PETER sit in the back of the plush car as it 
           struggles through traffic up town. SETH reaches into his bag 
           and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag. Their 
           conversation is quiet, as if they are afraid someone might be 
           listening.

                                 SETH
                        You want one?

                                 PETER
                        No.

           PETER gives him a bit of a look.

                                 SETH
                        What, we got them on our way to meet you 
                        at the office... we didn’t know what the 
                        fuck you wanted to talk about... 
                          (almost to himself)
                        ... thought you might’ve gotten some 
                        chick pregnant or something.

                                 PETER
                        I haven’t gotten laid in so long that’s 
                        not possible at this point.

                                 SETH
                        I guess that’s true.

           PETER looks out the window at all the people on the street 
           enjoying the Thursday night.

                                 PETER
                        Look at these people.

                                 SETH
                        What?

                                 PETER
                        We are in here stressing our fucking 
                        heads off that the world as we know it is 
                        ending, and they couldn’t give a fuck.

           SETH’S demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesn’t seem to 
           project much in the way of stress.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                        Right?

                                 SETH
                        I try not to let work get to me.

                                 PETER
                        I’ve noticed that.

                                 SETH
                        Look, we are twenty three years old...

                                 PETER
                        Twenty-Seven.

                                 SETH
                        Whatever, same thing, I made almost a 
                        quarter of a million dollars last year... 
                        for what... pushing some numbers around 
                        on a computer screen, so a bunch of 
                        glorified crack addicts could take that 
                        information and pretend to understand it, 
                        and then make a bet against some other 
                        jock half way around the world who if he 
                        wasn’t doing this would probably be in 
                        some OTB somewhere putting it all on 
                        number seven. And at the end of the day 
                        one guy loses and the other guy wins.

           PETER continues to look out the window in silence for a long 
           beat. Then with a little sly humor and a smile to SETH:  

                                 PETER
                        You do know it’s a little more 
                        complicated than that?

           SETH’S phone starts playing a ring tone. He looks down at the 
           text.

                                 SETH
                        It’s Will... He wants to know if we’ve 
                        found him? What do I tell him.

                                 PETER
                        Tell him that we haven’t found him.

           INT. LARGE GOLDSTONE ELEVATOR BANK 

           SAM ROGERS gets out of the elevator looking quite disheveled 
           and walks across the long and empty trading floor. He looks 
           around, then heads over to WILL EMERSON’S office where the 
           light is on. He lightly knocks on the glass.
           INT. WILL EMERSON’S OFFICE-SAME TIME

                                 SAM ROGERS

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Hey.

           SAM looks at WILL for some hint of what is going on, then 
           eventually puts his coat down and sits into a chair. They 
           wait for who goes first.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        So?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Eric Dale...

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Oh Jesus...

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Before he was escorted out of the 
                        building by security...

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I had nothing to do with that.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I know.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I’m sorry, go on.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        So as he was leaving the building he 
                        hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Who’s Peter Sullivan?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        One of Eric’s guys.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        OK.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        ...and tells him that he was almost on to 
                        something but hasn’t been able to figure 
                        it out. So he gives him the disk and says 
                        give it a try... but the last thing he 
                        says as the doors to the elevator close 
                        is ‘be careful’...

                        Yeah.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Be careful?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Yes.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Why?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Well... take a look at this model and you 
                        might understand.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Speak, you know I can’t read those 
                        fucking things they put together.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Basically the kid dives right into the 
                        thing after your little pep talk, nice 
                        job by the way, and he seems to have 
                        nailed it.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Nailed it?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        The kid figured out what Eric was 
                        missing. And...

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        and?

           WILL gives him a long pause.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        ...it isn’t good.

           WILL’S look gets SAM up and he comes over to stand behind 
           WILL at his desk and look at the computer.

                        As far as I can tell these here are the 
                        historical volatility index limits... 
                        which I guess our whole fucking trading 
                        model relies on pretty heavily...

                        if the thing starts getting outside those 
                        limits it gets ugly in a hurry. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        How ugly?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Real ugly.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        And how close to those limits have we 
                        gotten?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Oh we’re beyond close... We broke through 
                        five or six days over the last two weeks, 
                        but we’ve managed to stay on the upside 
                        of it... for now...

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        For now?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Well look what happens here when we get 
                        on the wrong side of it.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        What am I looking at?

           WILL takes his finger and points at a red number with a whole 
           lot of zeroes after it.

                                 SAM ROGERS (cont’d)
                        Is that a trillion?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        And that wouldn’t even be that bad a day 
                        for us... historically speaking.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Is this right?

                        I don’t know.

                        We shut his phone off.

           INT. LARGE UPSCALE CABARET CLUB ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE- SAME 
           TIME

           PETER and SETH are sitting at the bar each with a drink 
           facing camera. There are topless woman dancing in the 
           background and one dancing in front of them, PETER and SETH 
           look up occasionally. 

                                 PETER
                        What now?

                                 SETH
                        We should probably tell Will he’s not 
                        here.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.

           They both just continue to look forward and sip their drinks.

                                 SETH
                        What do think this girl makes in a night?

           Eventually SETH’S phone starts to ring. He picks it up.

           They both slam their drinks.

                                                               FADE OUT.

           This time they are really stuck in traffic, the car is not

           text again.

                                 SETH
                        He’s freaking out. We need to get down

           the bench. SETH reaches into his bag and takes out the forty 
           in the paper bag and starts drinking the beer again. He takes 
           a big sip.

           about to get onto the elevator. WILL and SAM are now dressed

           ready to start a new day even though it is almost one in the 
           morning. SETH is still holding the forty in the paper bag.

                                 SETH
                        Will. Mr. Rogers.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is 
                        Peter Sullivan.

                                 SETH
                        Sir.

           The doors of the elevator close and they all head up 
           together.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Guys.

           They all stand in silence as the elevator heads up until:

                                 PETER
                        Will?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Yes?

                                 PETER
                        Where are we going?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Going to get a second opinion on your 
                        work Peter. 

           PETER and SETH look at each other, growing more concerned. 
           The doors open and they exit. SETH looks for somewhere to 
           throw out his beer but can’t find a trash can. They follow 
           SAM and WILL along a wide hallway towards a very, very large 
           conference room with a commanding view of the city. 

           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM-SAME TIME 

           The table could easily seat twenty people although there are 
           only four people sitting at the other end of the room. They 
           stand. Everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands.

                                 ALL PRESENT
                        Slight hellos, etc.

           They all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of 
           paper, a pencil, and an empty binder. Sitting at the head of 
           the table is JARED COHEN. He is a blond boyish looking 43 
           year old, although carries himself with intense confidence. 
           He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees 
           roughly 25,000 employees. Next to him is his chief risk 
           assessment officer, SARAH ROBERTSON, the same woman from 
           outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC. 
           Next to her is her right hand man RAMESH SHAH, a sixty year 
           old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer. They 
           are all dressed sharply for a new day. Long silence.

                                 SETH
                        (Coughs)

           ALL PRESENT look down at him.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        So Sam what do you have for us?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Well... it should be here in a minute. 
                        Finding someone in the copy room at this 
                        hour was a little bit of a challenge.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Well why don’t we start by introducing 
                        everyone then. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        OK.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JARED COHEN
                        This is Sarah Robertson who you know, our 
                        chief risk assessment officer, her main 
                        lieutenant Ramesh Shah, and David Horn 
                        one of the firm’s in house council.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Nice to meet you all. This is Will 
                        Emerson my head of trading, and this 
                        is...

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman. They 
                        work in our risk department.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Where is Eric Dale?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        He was let go today.

           JARED COHEN looks at SARAH ROBERTSON as it would have been 
           her call to let ERIC go, she nods yes.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        So who’s left in your risk department?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        As of today that would be Peter and our 
                        junior analyst Seth...?

           Everyone looks down the table at PETER and SETH. Their 
           inexperience glares back.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Really?

           JARED looks back at SARAH, then the room goes silent again. 
           Finally a COPY ROOM STAFFER knocks on the door.

                                 COPY ROOM GUY
                        Will Emerson?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Here. Please just give one to everyone, 
                        thanks.

           The COPY ROOM GUY hands out the packets to everyone in the 
           room.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        So apparently Eric had been working on  
                        this for some time but was unable to 
                        finish it, as he was leaving the building 
                        today he gave the program to Peter here, 
                        and told him to see what he thought. 
                        Peter figured a few things out that Eric 
                        seemed to be missing and this is what 
                        came out. 

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Where is Eric Dale now?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        He’s been unreachable since he left the 
                        office.

           JARED COHEN and the others open up the printout in front of 
           them and start reviewing. SAM, WILL, PETER, and SETH just sit 
           in awkward silence staring at the other side of the table as 
           they all read. This goes on for a full very long minute. 
           Finally:

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Peter this is your work?

                                 PETER
                        Mainly Mr. Dale’s...

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        But this draft is yours?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        And what is your background?

                                 PETER
                        Background?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Your CV.

                                 PETER
                        I have been with the firm for two years 
                        working with Eric that whole time... But 
                        I hold a doctorate in engineering, 
                        specialist in propulsion, from MIT, with 
                        a Bachelors from Penn.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        What’s a specialty in propulsion?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 PETER
                        Well... in laymen terms my thesis was a 
                        study in the way that friction ratios 
                        effect steering outcomes in aeronautical 
                        use under reduced gravity loads. 

           Long silence.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        So you are a rocket scientist?

           The whole table looks over at Peter with some awe.

                                 PETER
                        Um... I was... yes.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        How did you end up here?

                                 PETER
                        Well it’s all just numbers really, you’re 
                        just changing what you’re adding up... 
                        and if I may speak freely the money is 
                        considerably more attractive here.

           JARED looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his 
           tone suddenly switches to serious, testy even.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        What time is it?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        It’s 2:15. 

           SAM and JARED just look at each other in silence for a bit.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        What do you have in exposure right now, 
                        tonight?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I don’t know... between 900 and 1.3... 
                        roughly.

                                 RAMESH
                        If Mr. Sullivan’s numbers are correct...

           RAMESH looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through 
           the numbers and takes a beat too long.  

                                 PETER
                        1.215 Trillion.

           RAMESH checks his number.

           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 RAMESH
                        Yes.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Fuck me... fuck me... And I’m guessing by 
                        the fact that you two haven’t said 
                        anything that the math checks out?

           JARED looks over at SARAH and RAMESH. SARAH then looks to 
           RAMESH. She looks back.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Look we’d need a little more time to go 
                        over this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to 
                        know what he’s doing. And I don’t have to 
                        tell you that this is a problem. 

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Thank you for that. What time is it?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        2:19

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Fuck me!

           Jared stands up and walks over to the window and looks out 
           over the city for a half minute. The rest of the room goes 
           silent. His reflection shows up in the glass. Finally:

                                 JARED COHEN (cont’d)
                        Sam how long under normal operations 
                        would it take your people to clear that 
                        from our books?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        What?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        The 1.2 trillion.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        All of it?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Yes. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I don’t know four weeks?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Four weeks?

           CONTINUED: (5)

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Two at best. But as you certainly know 
                        our business is selling AND buying. It 
                        doesn’t work for very long without both 
                        components. If Goldstone suddenly stops 
                        buying for a day or two that just doesn’t 
                        hide under the rug, it gets out and this 
                        whole this thing comes to a end... and 
                        right quick.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        I understand.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Do you?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        How many traders do we have left between 
                        your floor and Petersen’s?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I don’t know thirty.

           RAMESH has been looking down at the numbers while this 
           conversation has been taking place.

                                 RAMESH
                        Jared I’ve just been looking here a 
                        little closer, and it’s these VAR numbers 
                        that are really setting this thing off.

           JARED holds up a hand to interupt Ramesh. Jared nods his 
           head, his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Excuse me, I need to make a quick call.

           JARED calmly stands up and walks out a side door to a small 
           private meeting room for a long moment. The room stays 
           completely quiet the whole time he is gone. We hear nothing. 
           It is awkward to say the least. He comes back in and sits 
           down without missing a beat.

                                 JARED COHEN (cont’d)
                        Please...

                                 RAMESH
                        I was just saying, and just speaking 
                        completely off the record here, it won’t 
                        be long before someone else starts 
                        putting these in and sees the exact same 
                        thing we are looking at here. If they 
                        haven’t already.

           Pause.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Understood... And Sarah, what value would 
                        you allow to be placed on those assets 
                        that might be left on the books, if they 
                        had to be?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Why would they still be on the books?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Because suddenly no one wants to buy 
                        them.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Oh fuck you Sam... give me a fucking 
                        break, all at once?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        It’s a very simple business Jared. You 
                        and I talked about this last year...

           JARED turns around suddenly and cuts him off.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Sam.... Will, Peter, and..??

                                 SETH
                        Seth.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Seth, Could you please excuse us for a 
                        few minutes.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Of course.

           They stand up and start to exit the room.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Oh, and Peter?

                                 PETER
                        Yes?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Who else has seen this?

           PETER thinks that through.

                                 PETER
                        No one... besides us here.

                                 PETER
                        Yes.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        And can it really be that we don’t know 
                        where Eric Dale is? 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I’m afraid so. His wife tells us he 
                        hasn’t come home yet...and the firm shut 
                        off his phone today.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Perfect. 

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        He was quite distraught when he left 
                        here.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Of course.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        I need to know where he is.

           WILL, SETH, and PETER leave the room and close the door 
           behind them.

           INT. OUTSIDE HALLWAY OF EXECUTIVE BOARD ROOM-SAME TIME 

           They cross the hallway and sit on a bench staring into the 
           conference room. They talk very quietly.

                                 SETH
                        Jesus fucking Christ! Who is that guy?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        He’s Sam’s boss.

                                 SETH
                        He looks like he’s fifteen years old.

                                 PETER
                        Shhhuut up.

                        They can’t hear us. How old is he?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        He’s like forty.

                        Oh it happens all the time. He’s a

                                 PETER
                        What are they talking about?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        It aint pretty.

                        If people suddenly stop buying the shit 
                        we’re selling....

           They all look into the conference room and stare at JARED and 
           SAM talking to each other forcefully. Long pause.

                        What if we don’t have a choice?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        What does that mean? Fuck you... you 
                        don’t have a choice.

                        Yes, but what the hell do I know.

           JARED COHEN comes back over to the table and picks up the 
           packet.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Well, Mr. Shah tell me if I’m wrong but 
                        to me this looks like the jig is up. We 
                        are going off the rails here.

           SARAH now cuts him off abruptly.

                        We need a little time before we can give 
                        you our conclusion.

           SARAH closes the issue off with another look to JARED.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        OK.

                        Yes, here it is.

           SAM slides him the hard drive across the table, they all take 
           a second to follow it.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        We meet back in here in 45 minutes. 

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Good.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        And Sam we need Eric Dale, it’s making me 
                        very uneasy knowing he is out there right 
                        now wanting to put a knife in our backs 
                        while he’s not even aware he’s holding 
                        the knife in his hand.

           SAM is left with JARED in the room. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        What are you going to do?

                        I already did.

           SAM puts his hand on JARED’S shoulder briefly. They part.

           INT. FIRE STAIRWELL GOLDSTONE BUILDING-SAME TIME

           WILL, PETER, and SETH are in the stairwell walking up the 
           stairs. They are heard before they are seen. 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Hurry the fuck up fat boy.

                                 SETH
                        Where are we going? You do know that the 
                        elevator goes right down to the ground 
                        floor and we could have been smoking by 
                        now.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Shut up and save your breath, we are 
                        almost there.

           They come around and into frame and cross camera to an exit 
           door. The door swings open and the roof of the building with 
           the magnificent view uptown lays out in front of them. They 
           step out onto the roof.

           EXT. 45TH STORY ROOF GOLDSTONE BUILDING- SAME TIME

           They walk over towards the edge. It is a very clear night.

                        I didn’t know this was up here?

           They sit down on a girder, then light up. WILL’S look and 
           tone becomes a little darker as they all stare out into the 
           night. Long Pause. 

           INT. ELEVATOR BANK 

           SARAH and JARED wait for the elevator alone in silence. The 
           doors finally open and they get in. 

           INT. ELEVATOR- SAME TIME

           Still not a word. Finally.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        How long should this take you to confirm?

           Silence except for the ding as it comes to the floor and the 
           doors open.

                        O.k.

           They part.

           EXT. 45TH STORY ROOF GOLDSTONE BUILDING- SAME TIME 

           THEY are all still smoking and looking out over the city.  
           Finally WILL stands up and goes over to the edge and looks 
           over. He jumps up and sits on the edge.

                                 PETER
                        Careful.

                        Did you know the fear most people feel 
                        when they stand on the edge like this is 
                        not actually a fear that they will fall 
                        but instead it’s the subconscious fearing 
                        that they might jump?

                                 SETH
                        Well that’s very deep and depressing, 
                        thank you.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I know.

                                 SETH
                        Well can you get the fuck back over here 
                        cause you’re making me sick.

           WILL jumps down and comes back over to sit down. They stare 
           out again.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        So it looks like they are gonna have us 
                        dump this shit.

                                 SETH
                        What?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Yeah, you watch.

                        How?

                        A trillion bucks??

                        I’m just saying.

                                 PETER
                        How would they even do that?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        You can’t... it’s impossible. But they’ll 
                        figure out a way. I’ve been at this place 
                        for ten years and I’ve seen some things 
                        that you wouldn’t believe... and when all 
                        is said and done... they don’t lose 
                        money. They don’t care if everyone else 
                        does, but they won’t.

           Long silence.

                        a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I 
                        gave 150 to my parents to live off, so 
                        now you got what??

                                 PETER
                        Eight hundred.

                        I bought two cars last year for 150 
                        total. Probably another 100 eating... 25

                        Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was 
                        able to write most of it off, as 
                        entertainment.

           With that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the 
           building just as a massive CORPORATE HELICOPTER comes 
           sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over 
           their heads. It makes a turn and then comes in to land on the

           INT. JARED COHEN’S CORNER OFFICE SUITE-SAME TIME

           JARED and SAM are sitting in the office silently looking out 
           the window. The office is very large and has a full sitting 
           area with two couches. JARED is intensely going over the 
           papers in front of him. SAM is just looking out the window. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        How old are you?

           JARED stops reading with a deeply aware look and just stares 
           out the window as well.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        This is a very... very bad dream.

           SAM looks over at him directly.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I don’t know, seems like we actually may 
                        have just finally woken up.

           SARAH ROBERTSON comes to the door. SAM sits up.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Hello.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Come in.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        How do we look?

           Her look says it all.

                                 SAM ROGERS (cont’d)
                        I should go.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        No, you should stay.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        So?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                          (dead calm delivery)
                        It’s all legit... the kid killed it. The 
                        formula is worthless.

           They all look at each other as if they have seen a ghost.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        What do you mean?

                        It’s broken. 

                                 JARED COHEN
                        There are eight trillion dollars of paper

                        You mean you were wrong.

                        Don’t even start.... This was discussed.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I’m heading to the conference room.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        No.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        I’d like you to hear this.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        No... I don’t want to hear this. 

           SAM stares at them both.

                                 SAM ROGERS (cont’d)
                        How do you think I’ve stuck around this 
                        place so long.

           He walks out of the room. SARAH and JARED look each other 
           over.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        I’ve called Tuld.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Is there a contingency plan here?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        A contingency plan?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Yes.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        We went all in on this one.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        So we’ve got ourselves quite exposed 
                        here... haven’t we?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        To Tuld or the market?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Both.

           Just then laughing is heard coming down the hallway, then 
           WILL, PETER, and SETH come around the corner and walk towards 
           SAM who is standing outside the office. JARED and SARAH come 
           out into the hall.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Fellas?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I’m not sure it’s of interest to anyone 
                        but we were just grabbing a cigarette on 
                        the roof and a very spiffy looking 
                        helicopter dive-bombed us and then landed 
                        on the roof.

           JARED, SARAH, and SAM’S faces totally change. They all stand 
           and JARED walks over to the window and uses it as a mirror 
           and straightens his tie. 

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Well... that was fast. Here we go.

           JARED ushers the whole group out into the hall and towards 
           the elevators. He stops at a phone on a small table and dials 
           an extension.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Do you want everyone?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Yes, everyone. (into the phone) He’s 
                        here... we’ll meet you up there... we’re 
                        going now.

           He hangs up and they walk over to the elevator and wait in 
           silence. The door opens they all pile in.

                                 SETH
                        What floor Mr. Cohen?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        The top...

           Silence again as the elevator starts up. Just before the 
           doors open JARED speaks.

                                 JARED COHEN (cont’d)
                        Just one piece of advice to everyone here 
                        before we go in there... this could get a 
                        bit ugly but whatever you do... just... 
                        tell the truth... don’t try to change a 
                        word of it, no sugar coating... no one 
                        here is smart enough... including the 
                        rocket scientist.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        (whispering to Seth and Peter as he looks 
                        to his watch) It’s three in the morning?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        They are already in there waiting for 
                        you.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Oh.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Just in here, you can sit anywhere.

           They come around the corner and enter another even larger 
           conference room with an even more commanding view. Although 
           this time it is almost filled with people along one side of 
           the table. There are a team of five lawyers, three compliance 
           officers, the ceo’s right hand man, a couple of key board 
           members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits 
           RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of 
           the table is empty. 

                                 RIGHT HAND MAN   
                        Please sit down... here.

           They all file in and sit down. They all sit in silence... 
           waiting. Finally from the back of the room JOHN TULD comes 
           walking into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and 
           tie, is not tall, late fifties and doesn’t have a hair on his 
           head. He carries himself without much exception. His eyes 
           however tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He 
           walks the length of the room, everyone half stands up.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Please sit down.

           CONTINUED:

           He then seats himself at the head of the table. Everyone in 
           the room has the printout in front of them. JARED is seated 
           immediately to his left, then SAM, then SARAH, RAMESH, WILL, 
           PETER, and finally SETH.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        Welcome everyone. I must apologize for 
                        dragging you all here at such an uncommon 
                        hour but from what I’ve been told this 
                        matter needs to be handled urgently, so 
                        urgently in fact that it probably should 
                        have been addressed weeks ago... but that 
                        is meaningless to us here at this table. 
                        So why doesn’t someone please try to 
                        explain to me what’s the problem here?

           Everyone looks around the room a bit and finally JARED speaks 
           up.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if 
                        you look here at the top page of this 
                        printout...

           He cuts him off.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Jared, it’s a little early for all that, 
                        how bout in English? ... Actually I’d 
                        like to hear from the guy who put this 
                        thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it? 
                        Does he speak English?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Sir?

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I’d like to speak to the analyst who 
                        seems to have stumbled across this mess.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Well, that’s Peter Sullivan here.

           JARED looks down the table to PETER, as does everyone else in 
           the room. JARED gives him a go ahead look.

                                 PETER
                        Sir.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Ah, there he is.

                                 PETER
                        Yes sir.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 JOHN TULD
                        How old are you Mr. Sullivan?

                                 PETER
                        I’m twenty-seven sir.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Please call me John.

                                 PETER
                        Yes sir.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        So Mr. Sullivan why don’t you tell me 
                        what you think is going on here, and 
                        please speak as you might to a young 
                        child or a golden retriever, I didn’t get 
                        here on my brains I can assure you of 
                        that.

           PETER is very nervous.

                                 PETER
                        Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not 
                        know I work for Mr.Rogers here as an 
                        associate in the risk assessment and 
                        management office at GSMBS

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Now you lost me at GS...

                                 PETER
                        Sorry...

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I was joking Mr. Sullivan.

                                 PETER
                        Yes... Well as you probably know over the 
                        last 36-40 months the firm has begun 
                        packaging new MBS products that combine 
                        several different traunches of rating 
                        classification in one tradable security. 
                        This has been very profitable as I 
                        imagine you noticed. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I have.

                                 PETER
                        Well the firm is currently doing a 
                        considerable amount of this business 
                        every day.

                        The problem, which is I guess why we are 
                        here tonight, is that it takes us... the 
                        firm... almost a month to layer these 
                        products correctly thereby posing a 
                        challenge from a risk assessment 
                        standpoint.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?

                                 PETER
                        We have to hold these assets on our books 
                        longer than we might ideally like to. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Yes.

                                 PETER
                        But the key factor is these are 
                        essentially just mortgages, so that has 
                        allowed us to push the leverage 
                        considerably beyond what you might be 
                        willing, or allowed to do in any other 
                        circumstance, thereby pushing the risk 
                        profile without raising any red flags.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        And how far have we pushed that profile 
                        tonight Mr. Sullivan?

                                 PETER
                        We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion 
                        dollars... at GSMBS alone.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Give or take.

                                 PETER
                        Give or take.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and 
                        give me a little rope here, what I am 
                        guessing that your report here says is 
                        that considering the, shall we say bumpy 
                        road, we’ve been on the last week or so 
                        that the numbers that your brilliant co-
                        workers up the line ahead of you had come 
                        up with in the past don’t seem to make 
                        much sense anymore considering what’s 
                        taking place today?

           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 PETER
                        Actually not taking place today but 
                        what’s already taken place over the last 
                        two weeks. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        So what your saying is it’s already 
                        happened?

                                 PETER
                        Sort of.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say 
                        that that means for us here?

                                 PETER
                        Well, that’s where it becomes a 
                        projection. But...

           PETER looks down at JARED for approval to go forward.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        You’re speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.

                                 PETER
                        Well... sir... if those assets were to 
                        decrease by just 25 percent, and remain 
                        on our books... well... that loss would 
                        be greater than the current market 
                        capitalization of this company.

           The room goes silent. JOHN TULD looks at PETER long and hard. 
           He then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into 
           the city.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        So what you’re telling me Mr. Sullivan is 
                        that the music appears to be about to 
                        stop and we are going to be holding the 
                        biggest bag of stinking shit ever 
                        assembled in the history of capitalism?

           Everyone looks back at PETER.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        Mr. Sullivan?

                                 PETER
                        Well sir, I’m not sure I’d put it that 
                        way but let me clarify using your 
                        analogy, what this model shows is the 
                        music, so to speak, just slowing, if the 
                        music were to stop, as you put it, then 
                        this model would not be even close to 
                        that scenario. It would be considerably 
                        worse.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Well let me tell you something Mr. 
                        Sullivan. Do you want to know why I’m 
                        sitting here in this chair with you all, 
                        why I get the big bucks, so to speak?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I’m here for one reason and one reason 
                        only.

           JOHN TULD continues to look out over the city for a long 
           beat.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        I’m here to guess what the music is gonna 
                        do a week, month, a year from now. That’s 
                        it, nothing more....... and I’m afraid... 
                        standing here tonight... that I don’t 
                        hear... a... thing... just silence. 

           The room falls completely still for at least half a minute. 
           Then JOHN TULD spins around quickly with a considerably more 
           upbeat tone and looks up and down the table.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        So, now that we believe the music has 
                        stopped, what can we do about it?

           Long Silence.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        Mr. Cohen, Ms. Robertson, I’m afraid this 
                        is where you are supposed to step back 
                        in. Lord knows we relied enough on Mr. 
                        Sullivan today.

           JARED and SARAH come to attention and gather their thoughts.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        What have you got for us?

                                 JOHN TULD
                        What have I told you since the first day 
                        you walked into my office? (pause) That 
                        there are three ways to make a living in 
                        this business... Be first, be smarter, or 
                        cheat. Well I don’t cheat, and even 
                        though I like to think we have got some 
                        pretty smart people in this building of 
                        the two remaining options, it sure is a 
                        hell of alot easier to just be first. 

           The room goes silent again as Mr. Tuld stares back out the 
           window. 

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Sell it all today...

           JOHN TULD smiles just a bit. Then turns.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Is that even possible Sam?

           SAM looks across the room at JOHN TULD, they have known each 
           other for 35 years. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        It is, but at what cost?

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I’ll pay. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Really?

           JOHN and SAM look and read each other.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I think so.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        A trillion bucks of paper?

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Where does it come back to us?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Everywhere.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Sam, I don’t think you seem to understand 
                        what your boy down here just said... if I 
                        made you... how would you do it?

           SAM ROGERS looks down at the table for a long, long, beat.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        You bring the traders in for their normal 
                        6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, 
                        they’re gonna know it’s the end either 
                        way, so you’d have to throw them a bone, 
                        and a pretty big one. You’d have to come 
                        out of the gate storming... 40 percent 
                        done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your 
                        trades need to be sealed by eleven, cause 
                        by lunch the word will be out and by two 
                        o’clock you’ll be getting 65 cents on the 
                        dollar, if you’re lucky, and the feds 
                        will be in here looking up your ass and 
                        trying to slow us down. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Tim?

           He looks to a compliance lawyer down the table. 

                                 TIM LYONS
                        They’ll slow you down but it’s yours to 
                        sell. They can’t stop you.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        John... let’s just say we pull that off, 
                        which is saying something... the real 
                        question is... who are we selling this 
                        to? 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        The same people you’ve been selling this 
                        to for the last two years... and whoever 
                        else will buy it.

           They look at each other to see if they understand each other.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        If you do this you’ve killed that market 
                        for years. It’s over. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        (Nods.)

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        And you are selling something you know 
                        has no value.

                          (cuts him off cold)
                        We are selling to willing buyers at a 
                        current fair market price, so that WE may 
                        survive, Sam.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        You’ll never sell a thing to any one of 
                        them again.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I understand.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Do you?

                        Do you!!! This is it, Sam, this is it! 

           The rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them 
           go at it. Silence.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        It’s 4:00... Jared you’ve got till 5:00 
                        to break this down and draw me up a plan. 
                        Is there anyone else who actually knows 
                        what’s in there right now, block by 
                        block?

                                 PETER
                        Eric Dale.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Where is Eric Dale?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        As of today he is no longer with the 
                        firm.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        We have been trying to locate him.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        So he is just out there with this 
                        information?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        (Nods yes.)

           JOHN TULD looks down the lawyer side of the table to a secret 
           service looking guy.

                                 JOHN TULD

                                 LOUIS CARMELO
                        Done.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        OK, meet back here in an hour.

           Everyone stands up and begins to scatter.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        Sam... let’s talk.

           SAM hangs behind to talk as the room empties. They are now 
           alone looking out over the city as the light from the soon to 
           be rising sun is starting to show on the horizon. Long 
           silence.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        Hell of a town isn’t it?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Never really did it for me actually. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Really?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Always been kinda a grass and tree guy.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I’ve always loved this place. In my 
                        bones. Everything about it.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I can’t say I feel that about anyplace 
                        actually. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Are you going to be able to come on board 
                        here Sam?

           They look at each other.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I’m not sure John. This is too ugly.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        You and I are salesmen Sam, we sell. 
                        That’s what we do. It’s not complicated.

                        Exactly. And you damn well know that you 
                        don’t make a sale unless you think the 
                        guy is gonna come back for more, and 
                        tomorrow we are done.

           JOHN looks out and then over at SAM and decides whether or 
           not to proceed.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        This is it Sam.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        You keep saying that, what is that 
                        supposed to mean?

                                 JOHN TULD
                        It’s the big one. Most of us aren’t gonna 
                        make it out of this one.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Us?

                                 JOHN TULD
                        The street. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JOHN TULD
                        This won’t be the last ‘situation’ I will 
                        be having this week. It’s just the start.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        It’s only the start because we are 
                        starting it. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Maybe. But I don’t think that’s true, not 
                        this time. The numbers just don’t add up 
                        anymore.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Well I agree with you there, I’ve been 
                        saying that for years.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I mean if this kid can come up with 
                        this...? 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I don’t think I can go in knowing what I 
                        know and put the hammer down on these 
                        guys like this.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Fuck you soft, you’re panicking.

           The word panic slaps JOHN TULD in the face. He then calms.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        If you’re the first one out the door Sam, 
                        it’s not called panicking

           JOHN TULD stares aggressively at SAM.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Look, I obviously don’t have all the 
                        information that you do. But I think this 
                        could destroy this firm. You’ll never be 
                        trusted again. You are knowingly putting 
                        people out of business. Full stop. 

           JOHN TULD turns away from SAM and heads over to a phone. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I’ll take that into consideration.

           SAM heads out the door into the hallway where everyone is 
           mingling. SAM walks over to WILL, PETER, and SETH. 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        How’d that go?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        This is a fucking shit show.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        They are going to do it?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Probably.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Jesus.

                        Remember this day boys, remember this 
                        day.

           SAM walks out of the room. An assistant comes into the room.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Gentlemen, there is some breakfast down 
                        the hall if you guys are hungry.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

           WILL looks at the guys.

           INT. GOLDSTONE ELEVATOR BANK -SAME TIME

           JARED is waiting for the elevator again as SARAH walks up and 
           waits with him in silence. There is a housekeeping person 
           standing next to them as well. The doors open, and all three 
           get in.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        So what’s the strategy here?

                                 JARED COHEN
                        My guys are working on it downstairs 
                        right now.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        No, you and I... with Tuld.

           The doors open and the housekeeper gets off. The door closes 
           and they continue in silence... then.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        I’m not sure we need one, Sarah. That’s 
                        not the way I’ve ever done this.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                          (with distinct sarcasm)
                        Please.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        He knows where we both have stood on this 
                        all along. There’s nothing more to do.

           SARAH looks at him trying to judge the situation. The door 
           opens but SARAH gets out and holds the door as she turns 
           around.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        You better not even think of fucking me 
                        on this one, because if we are going 
                        down... you damn well know its going to 
                        be together.

           Jared looks at her for a long beat.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        No, I’m not sure I do know that.

           The doors close.
           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR

           WILL and SETH are sitting at the desks with large plates of 
           food in front of them eating. PETER is next to them working 
           on his computer and not eating.

                                 SETH
                        What do you think Tuld made last year?

                                 PETER
                        Would you shut the fuck up.

           WILL speaks with food in his mouth.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        86 mil. in salary and bonus.

                                 PETER
                        Really?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Yeah, it’s public record.

                                 SETH
                        That’s a lot of fucking money.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        He was worth a billion.

                                 PETER
                        Was?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Before today.

                                 SETH
                        Really?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        You’ll see. 

                                 PETER
                        ....I think I’m going to go get a coffee, 
                        does anyone need anything.

                        (Slight head shake no.)

                                 PETER
                        I need a little real air.

                                 SETH 
                        Probably a good idea.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Alright?

                                 PETER
                        If I get out of here for a minute?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Yeah of course... we’re not in jail here.

           They all look at each other, then a phone rings in the 
           distance.

                                 PETER
                        Will, your phone is ringing.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Fuck it.

                                 SETH
                        What about Eric?

           They all look at each other. WILL jumps up and runs over to 
           his office. SETH and PETER get up and walk over when he 
           doesn’t come right out. THEY stand on the other side of the 
           glass partition as he talks. SAM then comes out of his office 
           and stands next to them, WILL comes out.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        What?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        That was Eric’s wife. He’s alive, he’s 
                        home. He told her. He wouldn’t call us. 
                        He doesn’t know she called me.

           They all look to SAM to see what to do.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Where’s he live?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        The heights.

           SAM ROGERS looks at his watch.

                                 WILL EMERSON (cont’d)
                        Should we call Tuld’s guy?

                        is those guys going over there, you two 
                        go try to get him.

           SAM points to WILL and SETH.

                                 SAM ROGERS (cont’d)
                        But you’ve got to be back here by 6:00.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        OK.

           INT. SARAH ROBERTSON’S OFFICE

           SARAH is sitting behind her desk looking down at something. 
           JOHN TULD comes to the door and knocks lightly. She looks up 
           surprised to see him. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        May I come in?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Please, sit.

           JOHN TULD sits in front of her desk. Looks around, then looks 
           right at her.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        So... we are going to do this thing.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        OK.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        It’s going to be tight.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Is Sam on board?

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Not yet.

           TULD pauses.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        Sarah, I need a head to feed to these 
                        traders... and the board... this morning.

           SARAH looks up.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Is it me or Cohen?

           CONTINUED:

                                 JOHN TULD
                        It’s you.

           They stare at each other, she does not flinch.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Of course you are well aware I filtered 
                        several warnings for you and Cohen over a 
                        year ago on this?

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I’m not sure that’s the best path for you 
                        to be taking at this point... you’re 
                        going to be taken care of here...

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        (Nods)

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Obviously it’s quite complicated.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        John I was told that in no uncertain 
                        terms...

                                 JOHN TULD
                        It was all a very grey area.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        It was actually made very clear at the 
                        time, by you and I and Cohen.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I’d really prefer that you didn’t fight 
                        me on this...

           TULD pauses, they look at each other.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        We all fucked this one up pretty good...

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Yes.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        We need you to stay here till this is all 
                        done and the markets close. 

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        I understand.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        They’ll go over the numbers with you 
                        downstairs... Good luck.

           JOHN TULD looks at her. There is a security person standing 
           at the door who is waiting for her as he gets up and walks 
           out.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE NEAR OFFICE BUILDING-SAME TIME

           WILL and SETH are standing waiting for WILL’S car. Eventually 
           a brand new Range Rover Sport is brought down and they get in 
           and speed out of the garage. Several shots of them driving to 
           loud hip hop music. They look out on the city as they cross 
           the Brooklyn bridge.

           EXT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK BUILDING/STREET LEVEL-
           EARLY DAWN

           There is a haunting winter blue light bouncing through the 
           buildings. PETER is walking through the streets with mid-size 
           headphones on his ears. The music is all we hear. He wanders 
           around the almost completely empty city and the further he 
           walks the less his face changes. He finally stops to get a 
           coffee at a small street cart. He takes off his headphones to 
           pay and the music stops. The wind blows.

                                 COFFEE GUY
                        One fifty.

                                 PETER
                        Thank you.

           PETER turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he 
           see the figure of a woman coming towards him. It is 
           immediately obvious that he knows her. He stops and she keeps 
           slowly walking towards him. They stop in front of each other 
           squarely.

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        Hey...

                                 PETER
                        Hi.

           She has a very sweet face but looks tired. She appears to be 
           a bartender or something, she is not dressed for banking.

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        You coming home from work?

                                 PETER
                        Yes. 

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        You look tired.

                        So do you.

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        What are you doing here?

           She makes a slight gesture to her watch.

                                 PETER
                        I never left work.

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        You’re still working there?

           This cuts him a bit, why wouldn’t he be?

                                 PETER
                        Yes, of course...

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        Oh.

                                 PETER
                        Why?

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        I don’t know.

                                 PETER
                        Well, I should get back...

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        Yeah.

                                 PETER
                        Say hello to your Dad for me.

           She is pleasantly surprised by this gesture.

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        I will, thank you... You got any inside 
                        tips for him?

           This stops PETER dead in his tracks. His world tightens yet 
           clarifies. Finally.

                                 PETER
                        Sell.

           She looks at him with concern as he doesn’t even hint at a 
           smile as he says this. They then give a small kiss on the 
           cheek, and part.
           INT. SARAH ROBERTSON’S OFFICE

           SARAH is sitting at her desk staring out the window. She 
           calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes 
           it. Then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass 
           wall separating her office from the floor giving herself 
           total privacy. She walks over to her desk and sits down. She 
           reaches over and grabs a box of tissues, methodically 
           preparing to cry, almost like a surgeon preparing to work. 
           She sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected. Her 
           face starts to tweak just a little, but it just will not give 
           way. Again she tries. And again. She can not cry. She can’t 
           believe it. The deeply tragic look of total failure floods 
           her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face. Still no 
           tears. Finally she makes a forced noise like a sob, but it 
           isn’t real and she knows it. Then she tries to laugh to 
           herself, she tries again to laugh, but it too is not real. 
           She does feel something, but she simply and very sadly can 
           only openly express even to herself... nothing.

           EXT. ERIC DALE’S TOWNHOUSE IN BROOKLYN HEIGHTS

           WILL and SETH pull up in front of a very nice large 
           townhouse. They both look up at the house dreading going in.

                                 SETH
                        Jesus, nice place.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Yeah, he just bought it.

                                 SETH
                        I hope it was with cash.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        You are such a prick, and it wasn’t.

                                 SETH
                        I think I should stay here.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        My ass you’re staying here you fucking 
                        pussy.

                                 SETH
                        I just don’t think it would be 
                        appropriate. 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Get the fuck out of the car.

                                 SETH
                        Really?

                          (under his breath)
                        Mother fucker. 

           WILL gets out of the car and walks slowly up the stairs. He 
           knocks quietly. Eventually MRS. DALE comes to the door.

                                 WILL EMERSON (cont’d)
                        Mrs. Dale.

                                 MRS. DALE
                        Please, it’s Anna.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I am so sorry to intrude like this.

                                 MRS. DALE
                        Let me get Eric, would you like to come 
                        in?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        No I don’t think so, I can just wait 
                        here.

           WILL turns around and sits down on the stoop to wait for him. 
           Eventually ERIC comes out, he is still wearing his clothes 
           from work under a large coat but he looks very drunk. He sits 
           down next to Will. They look out into the night for a long 
           pause.

                                 ERIC
                        What are you doing here?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Peter finished that model you were 
                        working on.

                                 ERIC
                        Really?

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        It’s created a bit of a shit storm.

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah, I bet.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Do you want to see it... the model?

                                 ERIC
                        No.

                        No. But I’m pretty sure what it says.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Do you think he’s right?

                        I’m sure he’s right.

           They look out into the street again in silence.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting 
                        of the partners tonight. John Tuld has 
                        decided to liquidate our entire position.

                        Today.

           ERIC’S face doesn’t show much emotion. But he is surprised 
           and sincere.

                                 ERIC
                        Well, I am very sorry to hear that. 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        They want me to get you back there, they 
                        are worried about you being out here.

                                 ERIC
                          (with pleasant disgust)
                        Please.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        I’m just saying.

                        Not a chance.

           WILL lets it sit for a few beats.

           ERIC looks over at WILL. WILL lets him know with a look that 
           they mean real money. 

                                 ERIC
                        I’ve already been paid enough by them.

                        And Eric...don’t beat yourself up too bad 
                        over this shit.

                        Yeah.

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Who the fuck knows.

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah...

                        Some people like driving the long way 
                        home.

           He gets in his car and drives away. 

           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR

           The floor is totally empty. Slow guitar music playing. The 
           camera glides along the empty floor scanning over the many 
           different empty trading stations and the hundreds of computer 
           screens. It turns the corner and then finally enters SAM’S 
           office. He is totally asleep. He has headphones on and looks 
           like he could be dead he is so passed out. The music suddenly 
           changes pace and the volume change startles him up. He looks 
           around. He takes the headphones off, music stops. He finally 
           stands up and mildly limps his way out the office and down 
           the hallway into the mens room.  

           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK MENS ROOM ON THE 
           TRADING FLOOR- SAME TIME

           SAM ROGERS comes across the room and over to the sinks to 
           wash his hands. He looks in the mirror, and then decides to 
           wash his face as well. He stares at himself in the mirror. 
           The water drips off his face. He looks old. Just then the 
           door opens and JOHN TULD walks into the room. He does not go 
           to use any of the facilities. He stops and looks to talk to  
           SAM.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        There he is.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        John.

           SAM walks over and takes a towel to wipe off his hands and 
           face. Finally he looks up. 

                                 SAM ROGERS (cont’d)
                        So what’s it look like John? 

           The line is delivered a bit too lightly for JOHN TULD’S 
           liking.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Cohen has done a nice job. It can work.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        What does that mean?

                                 JOHN TULD
                        It means, as you very well know, that you 
                        are a very important piece of this 
                        puzzle.

           They look directly at each other.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        Here.

           JOHN TULD hands SAM a single piece of folded paper. SAM opens 
           it and looks at it. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        That’s very generous.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        It’s not a gift. I need to know you are 
                        with me on this.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I’m with the firm John.

           JOHN TULD is now taking a far more forceful stance, almost 
           blocking the doorway.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        I won’t get what I need out of your boys 
                        today unless they believe you... unless 
                        they believe in you completely.

           He stares at SAM.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        Are you in?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I told you I have my reservations. 

                                 JOHN TULD
                        Well you can’t have any reservations.

           They both stare at each other.

                                 JOHN TULD (cont’d)
                        And I need to know now.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           SAM looks down at the floor then at the piece of paper in his 
           hand, then long and hard at JOHN TULD.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I’m with the firm completely John, as I 
                        always have been. Excuse me.

           SAM slightly moves JOHN out of the way and then he exits, the 
           door closes. 

           EXT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK BUILDING/STREET LEVEL

           PETER is still walking around on the street with the music 
           playing. He comes around a corner and crosses a large open 
           windswept corporate plaza.  As he approaches the building he 
           sees SAM ROGERS standing in front having a cigarette. He 
           walks towards him and then finally decides to take off the 
           headphones. The music stops and the wind kicks in. 

                                 PETER
                        Hello.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Peter.
                          (silence)
                        You want one?

                                 PETER
                        I don’t smoke.

           But PETER holds his place comfortably.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        That’s good. I don’t much either.

                                 PETER
                        It’s kinda beautiful out right now.

           They both look out. Slow pacing.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Yeah, I guess it is...
                          (almost surprised)
                        I’ve never really liked this town much.

                                 PETER
                        How long have you been here?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Forty years.

                                 PETER
                        I think it’s beautiful. The whole place. 
                        Forty years, that’s something.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Yeah.

                                 PETER
                        Aren’t you tired?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        A little... but I don’t work as hard as 
                        you do.

                                 PETER
                        That’s not true. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        No it is.

           Long silence.

                                 PETER
                        Are we all getting fired after today?

           SAM looks out and thinks about it for a while.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Probably. 

                                 PETER
                        They’re going to fire you?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        That’s not what they’ll call it, but... 
                        it’ll be a mercy killing really.  

           SAM looks at PETER and sees he’s not smoking and freezing. 

                                 SAM ROGERS (cont’d)
                        Are you cold? You don’t have to stand out 
                        here for me.

                                 PETER
                        No, no if it’s ok I just don’t want to go 
                        back in there just yet.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Please, I certainly understand that.

           Long beat.

                                 PETER
                        I think I know your son.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Really?

                        Yeah. Not well... but, he always seemed 
                        like a nice person.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        He is a nice person. 

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I guess you could say alot worse about a 
                        guy.

                                 PETER
                        Have you told him what’s about to happen?

           They look at each other to check the nature of the question.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        What do you mean?

                                 PETER
                        This whole thing.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        No.

                                 PETER
                        Oh...

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I hadn’t even thought of it.

                                 PETER
                        I guess it’s illegal anyway?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Yeah... who the fuck knows anymore.... 
                        well even if it was you’d sure as hell 
                        never get caught.

                                 PETER
                        He’s already pretty rich anyway though 
                        right? He doesn’t need the help.

           SAM ROGERS laughs quietly.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        That’s very true.

                                 PETER
                        He works with a friend of mine.

                        Yeah, he’s much richer than me, I know 
                        that much. 

                                 PETER
                        But you are taller.

           Laughs again.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        That’s true. It’s not much... but it’s 
                        something... What did your father do?

                                 PETER
                        He’s a doctor.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Really?

                                 PETER
                        Eyes.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Now that’s something.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah... it is. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Did he want you to do that?

                                 PETER
                        No, never.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Oh.

           Another helicopter is heard overhead landing on the building. 
           Peter looks up.

                                 PETER
                        They’re all coming in now.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Yes they are. 

                                 PETER
                        Have you ever done anything like this 
                        before?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        No... never.... not even close.

           SAM takes a deep drag off his cigarette.

           PETER looks down at his watch, then thinks about what to say 
           next.

                                 PETER
                        Do you really think this is the only... 
                        or the... right thing to do?

                        I’m not sure.

           Now SAM looks around and thinks.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I’m not either.

                        So this is gonna make a pretty big mess 
                        of it, then?

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I don’t even want to think about it.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Just doesn’t quite seem...

           Takes another long drag.

                                 PETER
                        I know.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        (Very slightly shakes his head.)

                                 PETER
                        Well. I guess we should get back.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Yeah. 

           They both stand in place for a long beat then finally turn 
           and head into the building. The camera follows them through 
           the long marble lobby. Through security.

           They comfortably don’t talk to each other the entire time 
           till they get into the elevator.

           INT. ELEVATOR-SAME TIME

           Staring ahead in silence.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Well good luck, you know, in the 
                        future... Seems like you’ll probably be 
                        just fine. 

                                 PETER
                        Thank you.

           The doors open.

           INT. EXECUTIVE BATHROOM STALL

           A very tight shot of SETH sitting fully clothed on the toilet 
           with the lid on. He is crying very, very intensely but almost 
           silently. He puts his head in his hands and just once or 
           twice lets out a loud noise. Eventually someone comes into 
           the room and he hears the person go over to the sink and 
           start running water. SETH tries to stop himself from crying. 
           Eventually he accepts that the guy is not leaving and he 
           comes out of the stall and walks over to the sinks. JARED is 
           standing in front of the mirror with his shirt off shaving. 
           His new shirt and tie are on a hanger next to him. SETH walks 
           up to a sink next to him and it is very obvious that he has 
           been crying. He undoes his collar and starts to wash his 
           face. Finally JARED speaks.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        You alright?

           SETH sends him a dagger of a look through the reflection in 
           the mirror. 

                                 SETH
                        You just fired me.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        I’m sorry...

                                 SETH
                        This is all I’ve ever wanted to do.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        Really?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SETH
                        Yes...

           This hits JARED just a touch.

                                 JARED COHEN
                        I am sorry.

           JARED does up his tie perfectly looks at SETH again in the 
           eye. Then walks out. 

           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS LARGE EXECUTIVE LOUNGE AREA-SAME TIME

           SARAH ROBERTSON is sitting in a club chair staring out the 
           window. The coffee table in front of her has a huge spread of 
           fruit and cheese and pastries. She is not eating. She sits 
           and stares. Eventually the door behind her opens, LOUIS 
           CARMELO walks in with ERIC. 

                                 LOUIS CARMELO
                        They are almost ready for you Ms. 
                        Robertson. Couple of minutes.

           LOUIS leaves the room. ERIC looks over at SARAH then sits in 
           the chair near her. Silence.

                                 ERIC
                        You as well? 

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Yes.

                                 ERIC
                        Jesus.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Yeah.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Thank you... Sam and the rest of your  
                        floor are gone after today as well.

                                 ERIC
                        Really... and Cohen?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        No... still here.

                                 ERIC
                        Of course...

           CONTINUED:

           Long awkward pause. Eric looks around for something, anything 
           to talk about.

                                 ERIC (cont’d)
                        Are you still dating that tall guy... 
                        from the Christmas thing?

           She looks over at him with a slight smile, giving him credit 
           for trying to break the ice.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        No.

                                 ERIC
                        He was very tall.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        6’7’’......

                                 ERIC
                          (quietly)
                        Wow.

           Silence.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        I did pass on your concerns last year... 
                        just so you know.

                                 ERIC
                        It doesn’t matter.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        It does.

           The door swings open and a catering person comes in rolling a 
           cart with another large tray with more food on it. She places 
           it on the table next to the other food. The abundance is 
           overwhelming.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON (cont’d)
                        Thank you. 

           The caterer leaves. ERIC looks around.

                                 ERIC
                        Have they taken all the phones out of 
                        this room?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON

                                 ERIC
                        Paranoid fucks.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Yeah... I didn’t think they were going to 
                        be able to get you back here.

           ERIC stands up and goes over to the window.

                                 ERIC
                        They told me they were going to drag me 
                        through hell on everything from my 
                        options to healthcare over the next two 
                        years or I come back and make... 
                          (he looks up and does a little 
                           math in his head)
                        $176,471.00 an hour to sit in this room 
                        quietly... it wasn’t much of choice.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        It never is.

           ERIC goes back and sits in the chair.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON (cont’d)
                        Obviously looking back, the point was 
                        expressed with insufficient urgency... 
                        but your point was passed on... I need 
                        you to know that.

                                 ERIC
                        OK.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        Eric.

                                 ERIC
                        I understand, there was nothing you could 
                        do.

           Now SARAH questions herself.

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        I guess... at the time... it didn’t seem 
                        like there was much of a choice.

                                 ERIC
                        It never does.

           They both look at each other with miniscule smiles, then out 
           the windows onto the city, defeated. Long silence.

           Long pause as he lets her alone. 

                                 ERIC
                        What is your package going to look like?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        I don’t know, that’s what I’m waiting for 
                        now.

                                 ERIC
                        Should be pretty good, no?

                                 SARAH ROBERTSON
                        It better be.

           INT. LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM ON THE MAIN TRADING FLOOR-6:30 AM

           There are 40 young, 90% male, traders jammed into the 
           conference room next to the trading floor talking very loudly 
           with one another. They are oblivious to what is about to 
           happen. Eventually, SAM, WILL, JARED, and a firm lawyer, come 
           into the room. Everyone quiets down a bit. 

                                 WILL EMERSON
                        Alright, hey...(whistles).

           They go silent as they notice SAM standing at the head of the 
           table. JARED and the lawyer are standing off in the corner 
           just to observe. SAM looks somber.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Thank you all for coming in a little 
                        early this morning, I know yesterday was 
                        pretty bad, I wish I could say that today 
                        is going to be less so but that isn’t 
                        going to be the case. Now I am supposed 
                        to read this statement here to you all 
                        but how bout you read it on your own time 
                        and I’ll just tell you what the fuck’s 
                        going on here.

           THE LAWYER looks at JARED then they look at SAM, he 
           continues.

                        I have spent the night here meeting with 
                        the executive committee and the decision 
                        has been made to begin to unwind a 
                        considerable portion of the firm’s 
                        holdings in several key asset classes. 
                        The crux of it is... in the firm’s 
                        thinking the party is over as of this 
                        morning. There is going to be 
                        considerable turmoil in the markets for 
                        the foreseeable future. They believe that 
                        it is better to have this turmoil begin 
                        with us... as a result the firm has 
                        decided to liquidate its entire holding 
                        of fixed income MBS today. 

           An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the 
           traders in the room.

                        You should be getting a breakdown right 
                        now, you will see the accounts you are 
                        responsible for today. I’m sure it hasn’t 
                        taken you long to understand the 
                        implications of this sale on your 
                        relationships with your counterparties 
                        and as a result on your careers. I have 
                        expressed this reality to the executive 
                        committee and they understand. As a 
                        result, if you are able to complete a 93% 
                        sale of your assets you will receive a 
                        1.4 million dollar one off bonus. If the 
                        floor as a whole is able to achieve a 93% 
                        sale we all get an additional 1.3 million 
                        a piece. Because of this,  if you burn 
                        through your allotment by noon, get 
                        moving around the floor and start picking 
                        up other guys leftovers...

           SAM stops for a second and looks around the room. 

                                 SAM ROGERS (cont’d)
                        For those of you who have never been 
                        through this before, this is what the 
                        beginning of a fire sale looks like. I 
                        don’t have to tell any of you that the 
                        first hour and a half is going to be very 
                        important. This is obviously not the way 
                        any of us would like for this to be going 
                        down, but the ground is shifting below 
                        our feet, and there appears to be no 
                        other way out.

           SAM looks around the room again, person by person and sees 
           that they indeed know what needs to be done. 

                                 SAM ROGERS (cont’d)
                        Obviously... this is a very unique 
                        situation... if we are successful today 
                        we will have been successful in 
                        destroying our own jobs... I can not 
                        promise that each of you will be 
                        repositioned within the firm, but I can 
                        tell you that I am very proud of the work 
                        we have done together here, I have been 
                        at this here for 39 years, and I know... 
                        from experience people are going to say 
                        some nasty stuff about what we have done 
                        here, and what you have devoted a portion 
                        of your life to. But have faith that in 
                        the greater picture our skills have not 
                        been wasted, we have accomplished much, 
                        and our talents have served some greater 
                        good...

           He looks down at the ground, then back up around the room. 
           Then he walks out.

           INT. GOLDSTONE STERNS INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR- 8:20 AM

           There is a very quiet energy on the floor. A low murmur. Then 
           a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that 
           the CEO, JOHN TULD is about to come onto the floor. He 
           appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent. JOHN 
           walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into 
           the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. He 
           looks around and stands in letting the drama build. Then he 
           climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a 
           general.

                                 JOHN TULD
                        By the end of the day today almost 
                        everyone else in the world, including 
                        myself, will have considerably less money 
                        than they began the day with..... You, in 
                        this room, are the exception. You will 
                        leave this room richer. You will fire the 
                        first shot, I wish it didn’t have to be, 
                        but at times the market must eat its 
                        weak, and you all... are not the weak. We 
                        must strike quick, with no doubt, if you 
                        hear pause on the line, attack.

                        getting in your faces, sniffing around, 
                        you let us take care of them and you just 
                        keep going. We own what we are choosing 
                        to sell today and there is nothing they 
                        can do about it. 107 years ago this firm 
                        was founded, today we secure our place 
                        for next 107. You’ve got two minutes, 
                        finish this, so we can get on to the next

           The floor is silent. The bell rings and it explodes with 
           activity. The following is a montage of trading activity 
           throughout the day, using actual trading floor footage from 
           around the world, intercut with the people at Goldstone

           Over the black screen, we hear cheering as they have 
           succeeded.

                                                            STILL BLACK:

           We hear the sound of someone digging in dirt with a shovel.

                                                                FADE IN:

           EXT. VERY UPSCALE OLD GROWTH SUBURBAN NYC BACKYARD- 11:00 PM

           Fade up on SAM ROGERS standing in a hole in the backyard 
           digging. Next to him is a large black medical-looking bag.

           He continues to dig. Eventually the flood lights from the 
           house come on and the whole back yard lights up. Then the 
           sliding glass door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a 
           bath robe and slippers comes out onto the deck. It is SAM’S 
           EX-WIFE. MARY ROGERS. She squints towards the back of the 
           yard.

                                 MARY ROGERS
                        Hello! ... I’ve called the police.

           SAM stops digging and looks up and leans on the shovel 
           handle.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Mary.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Yup.

                                 MARY ROGERS
                        What are you doing?

           She comes down off the deck and walks across the lawn up next 
           to the hole.

                                 MARY ROGERS (cont’d)
                        What are you doing?

                        Ella died.

           MARY looks down and sees the large canine body bag.

                                 MARY ROGERS
                        Oh God.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Tumor on her liver. It was horrible. 

                                 MARY ROGERS
                        Well I’m very sorry.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Yeah... I really loved that dog

                                 MARY ROGERS
                        I know, but Sam you don’t live here 
                        anymore. 

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I was driving home from the vet and this 
                        is the only place I could think to bury 
                        her. This is where she belongs...

           She looks at him deeply.

                                 MARY ROGERS
                        Well. You should have called.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        I know.

                                 MARY ROGERS
                        Are you alright? You look terrible.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Yeah. Tough day all around.

                        I heard, Sammy called.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Is he alright?

                                 MARY ROGERS
                        He said they got hammered, but got out 
                        alive.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Good, I was going to call him this 
                        morning... but...

                                 MARY ROGERS
                        Well, I am going to go back in to bed. 
                        The alarm is on so don’t try to break in. 
                          (Sam smiles)
                        Well, you take care of yourself.

                                 SAM ROGERS
                        Is it alright if I finish up here?

                                 MARY ROGERS
                        Yes.

           MARY walks back across the lawn into the house and turns off 
           the lights. SAM starts back in digging the ditch and starts 
           humming a song. He keeps digging as the song he is humming 
           then kicks in with the full version.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.
