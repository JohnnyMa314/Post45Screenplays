          War has taught me that each one of us contains every ingredient of 
          the human recipe. The only question is how much of each attribute 
          we allow- or force- to dominate our being.

          cause.

           -- fit for a British Lord. PAINTINGS of horses and hounds. 
           SIR DONALD FITZROY (60’s) a bulky, monument of a man, reads 
           BLUEPRINTS: written in ARABIC. Flips the page to reveal-- a 
           NUCLEAR LOGO drawn over a huge POWER PLANT. 

           INT. SCOPE POV - APARTMENT - DAY  

           CROSSHAIRS bullseye the back of FITZROY’S HEAD. As if sensing 
           he’s being watched, Fitzroy turns. Eyes looking into us-- as 
           if challenging the shooter until-- TWO GIRLS (both 8, one 
           cheerful, one serious) enter. Charging into his open arms. 

                                 GIRLS (O.S. FILTERED)
                        Grandad! 

                                 FITZROY (O.S. FILTERED)
                        You’re a moment late, girls. Big 
                        Bird and Snuffleupagus just left. 

           The Girls are too old for the joke. The cheerful one laughs 
           anyway. Their MOM (30) enters. Pecks Fitzroy’s cheek-- 

                                 MOM (O.S. FILTERED)
                        Hello, pop--

           BEHIND THE SHOOTER-- looking up from the scope. Can’t see his 
           face, just his BODY in a WINDOW REFLECTION. Swift moving 
           clouds clear; brightening his reflection. Grows FUZZY as we--

           INT. A DARK CONFINED SPACE - DAY

           Calm, controlled breathing. Can’t see a thing, but someone’s 
           in here-- very close. A CURSOR sweeps the screen: 

                        - AL HASAKAH, EASTERN SYRIA - 
           BEARDED MAN (30’s), feral; not to be fucked with, flicks open 
           a HANDHELD SCREEN, the ghostly light reveals he’s-- 

           INSIDE A METAL CYLINDER 

           Five-feet high. Three-feet across. As if sealed inside an OIL 
           DRUM standing on end. Seeing him stuffed in here should freak 
           us out, like being buried alive. Bearded Man is unaffected. 
           Wearing a jumpsuit, military gear. SWEAT drips off his face--

           -- POOLING on the floor of the cylinder. SALT CRYSTALS on the 
           edges. He’s been in here for a long time. Waiting. Watching--

           HIS SCREEN SHOWS: a live camera-feed of a POWER PLANT ROOM.

           No windows. Crawling with WORKERS. HUGE MACHINES marked with 
           NUCLEAR WARNING DECALS. Suddenly--

           -- TEN SYRIAN SOLDIERS march into the room. Waving all 
           WORKERS out, conducting a security sweep.  

           BEARDED MAN-- tenses. Stretches. As he does it, we notice for 
           the first time, he appears to be floating. His ass hovers 
           three inches off the bottom of the cylinder. He’s got a 
           HARNESS around his waist. TAUGHT ROPE stretches to the roof. 

           BACK ON HIS SCREEN: Syrian Soldiers line the entry, salute as-
           - TWO SYRIAN GENERALS, ENGINEERS, and a NIGERIAN EXECUTIVE 
           enter. Some kind of inspection. 

           BEARDED MAN snaps his screen shut. Grabs the floor of the 
           cylinder, picks it up, as if lifting a manhole cover. Light 
           floods in from below. We finally get a good at his tiny room. 

           He’s not trapped in some oil drum. He’s crunched at the very 
           top of a VERTICAL SHAFT. METAL LADDER, running down the side, 
           descends THREE STORIES straight down. His ROPE is clipped to 
           the very TOP RUNG of the ladder, right next to the ceiling. 

           NOTE: the idea is that he’s created a false floor below him. 
           Anyone that looked up the shaft from below would never notice 
           the ‘ceiling’ was three feet lower than it should be. An 
           ‘Inside Man’ illusion to create his tiny hideout. 

           Bearded Man drops, rope running through a gloved hand. 

           STRAIGHT DOWN ONE STORY. Stops in front of the FIRST EXIT--

           -- looking out at the POWER PLANT ROOM he’s been watching. 
           The SYRIAN GENERALS, and the NIGERIAN EXECUTIVE (same men 
           from the screen) are standing ten feet in front of him. 

           Bearded Man, zero emotion, fast, aims a GUN. FIRES TWICE--  
           -- BOTH BULLETS find their mark-- right through Nigerian 
           Executives NECK! Esophagus, spinal cord blows out behind him!

           Bearded Man, a well oiled machine, detaches his rope, clips 
           it to the ladder rung right next to him, then leap-climbs up. 

           TWO SYRIAN SOLDIERS SPRINT TOWARDS THE LADDER SHAFT ENTRY-- 

           -- guns out. YELLING IN ARABIC. They see THE ROPE, clipped to 
           a rung. Rope snakes down two stories below. They look up.

           No one there. Bearded Man has his false floor back in place.

           -- SOLDIERS grab the rope. As they slide down, we RISE UP THE 
           CYLINDER, PUSHING THROUGH THE FALSE BOTTOM-- 

           BACK INSIDE THE DARK CONFINED SPACE

           Bearded Man is shockingly calm as he dons a RADIATION SUIT. 
           Hard to do in here, but he’s practiced. Zips it up. Before 
           pulling the MASK ON, he grabs a REMOTE DETONATOR--

           SOMETHING gets sucked through a grate as we CUT TO--

           leaving-- wearing a MASK. We recognize the eyes of BEARDED 
           MAN as he strolls out the front exit, and we DISSOLVE TO--

           Driving towards PRESS and MOURNERS gathered around a MILITARY 
           GATE. Driver hits a button. Shades roll up for all windows, 
           shielding them from prying eyes and flashbulbs. 

           THE GATES OPEN, they don’t slow, roaring into the THREE ARMS 
           DISTRICT. Home to Nigeria’s Congress, the Supreme Court, and--

           -- SOLDIERS open the Range Rover doors for them. MR. FELIX 
           (40’s) handsome and sharp, waits for Madame Laurent. 

                                 FRENCH EXECUTIVE 
                        Madame Laurent, this is Mr. Felix-- 
                        the Prime Minister’s Intelligence 
                        Advisor.

           She extend a hand. They shake. No warmth from either one. 

                                 MR. FELIX
                        Thank you for flying down on such 
                        short notice.

           INT. DEFENSE MINISTRY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Madame Laurent and her Execs sit in a gaudy GOLD room. Mr. 
           Felix, flanked by TWO GENERALS, controls a PLASMA SCREEN--

                                 MR. FELIX
                        Eastern Syria. Twenty hours ago. 

           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE: different ANGLES than before-- show the 
           NIGERIAN EXECUTIVE and SYRIAN GENERALS enter the power plant--

                                 MR. FELIX
                        You can see the President-elect 
                        there, touring Syria’s first 
                        nuclear power plant. The facility 
                        is guarded by five hundred soldiers 
                        and state of the art security-- 

           -- a FLASH as Bearded Man’s HANDGUN spits two bullets. IMAGE 
           FREEZES: a shadow of Bearded Man in the ladder well.

                                 MR. FELIX
                        -- his killer is a contract 
                        assassin codenamed ‘Gray Man’. He 
                        is considered the world’s most 
                        accomplished singleton operator.
                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        Identifying an assassin is usually 
                        the hardest part. How can you be 
                        certain that is the Gray Man?

                                 MR. FELIX
                        Three weeks ago, paid informants in 
                        two separate Intelligence services 
                        revealed that the Gray Man accepted 
                        a contract to kill him.

                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        And you still let him go to Syria?

                                 GENERAL #1
                        The visit was top-secret, and the 
                        facility was exceptionally secure. 

           Mr. Felix hits a button. A NEW WINDOW OPENS-- Surveillance 
           footage appears: CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN A HALLWAY-- TWO 
           SEPARATE ANGLES, one coming, one going--

                                 MR. FELIX
                        The only lapse occurred three days 
                        prior to the assassination-- 

           TWO BIRDS suddenly appear from behind the men, can’t see 
           where they came from, but both birds fly right towards the 
           CAMERAS, flapping in front of them, pecking the lens. 

                                 MR. FELIX
                        -- there is a crawl space in the 
                        roof between the two cameras-- 

           Seconds later, GUARDS ENTER, from both doors, shoo them away-- 

                                 MR. FELIX
                        We think he made a feeder from a 
                        video camera to train the birds, 
                        then holed up somewhere inside. 

                                 FRENCH EXECUTIVE 
                        And the escape?

                                 MR. FELIX
                        Used a Cesium isotope, just enough 
                        to trigger the facility’s radiation 
                        alarms. Probably stolen from a 
                        hospital X-ray machine--

           Doors open. SECRETARY enters, addresses Madame Laurent--

                                 SECRETARY
                        The Prime Minister’s ready for you--
           INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - DAY

           -- Madame Laurent is escorted in. ISAAC ABUBAKER (40’s) 
           stands with his back to her, staring at his brother’s COFFIN, 
           draped with a NIGERIAN FLAG. A PHOTO OF NIGERIAN EXECUTIVE 
           AKA JULIUS ABUBAKER (50’s) in military regalia on top. 

           Though Isaac Abubaker clearly hasn’t slept, he still emanates 
           a polished, magnetic warmth. Doesn’t turn or look up--    

                                 ISAAC ABUBAKER
                        -- Madame Laurent, when you need 
                        advice, whom do you ask?

                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        My father. He is well-versed in the 
                        burdens of running a conglomerate. 

                                 ISAAC ABUBAKER
                        And once he passes away?

                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        It will get very lonely. 

                                 ISAAC ABUBAKER
                        My brother was the only person I 
                        ever trusted. 

                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        Do you have any idea who may have 
                        orchestrated his assassination?

                                 ISAAC ABUBAKER
                             (finally looks up)
                        The Central Intelligence Agency. 
                        Julius was secretly negotiating to 
                        supply Syria with Uranium. CIA 
                        warned him repeatedly not to do it.

                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        So they kill him, then give you the 
                        option to cancel the deal?
                             (he nods)
                        Isaac, you didn’t ask me to drop 
                        everything and fly down here for a 
                        pep talk. What do you want? 

                                 ISAAC ABUBAKER
                        I was not elected by the people but 
                        selected by my brother. Right now, 
                        my only qualification is my DNA. 

                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        You’re on the hunt for legitimacy?
           He nods, waves for her to follow him-- DOWN A HALLWAY--

                                 ISAAC ABUBAKER
                        To get it, I will need you to hunt 
                        down the man who killed my brother.

                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        We are not in the revenge business.

                                 ISAAC ABUBAKER
                        This is not some negre ritual. 

           -- GUARDS flank a PRIVATE ELEVATOR. They enter. Doors close.

                                 ISAAC ABUBAKER
                        Personally, I’d like to go after 
                        the CIA Officer who organized it. 
                        Politically, that’s a non-starter. 
                        I can’t take credit without 
                        painting a bullseye on my forehead, 
                        and most Nigerians will find little 
                        honor in me killing some doughy 
                        suit who works in a cubicle. 

           BING! DOORS OPEN-- they enter NIGERIA’S version of the OVAL

                        At my confirmation, if I announce I 
                        have avenged a Nigerian hero by 
                        hunting down and killing CIA’s best 
                        assassin, I go from pretender to

           Passing over the EIFFEL TOWER, the ARC DE TRIUMPH-- away from 
           the sexy part of PARIS-- towards the LA DEFENSE DISTRICT. 

                                 MADAME LAURENT (O.S.)
                        This is a simple business decision; 
                        lose billions-- or kill one man.

           INT. POSH OFFICE - COMMERCIAL HIGH-RISE - DAY

           KURT REIGEL (40’s) a tall, blonde, strongly built German is 
           on the phone. Easy on the eyes, but hard to look at. 
           Something about him elicits a skin-prickling danger. His 
           office is stocked with the HEADS OF ENDANGERED SPECIES-- 

                                 MADAME LAURENT (O.S.)
                        I want a full partition between

                        Reigel. No links to LaurentGroup.

                        We‘ll have to locate, and co-opt 
                        his handler. Doing that quickly can 
                        be a dirty business. 

                                 MADAME LAURENT (O.S.)
                        Whatever it takes.

           EXT. ESTABLISHING - DAY

           AN OLD LANDCRUISER barrels down a dirt road, surrounded by 
           hills of dusty, baked-beige nothingness found in-- 

                - NORTHWESTERN IRAQ, 30 MILES FROM THE SYRIAN BORDER -

           INT. LANDCRUISER - DAY

           Bearded Man, AKA the GRAY MAN drives. Real name, known to 
           only a few people on earth is COURT GENTRY. He’s shifting his 
           focus between the road ahead-- and a FIELD OF DATE PALMS with 
           a WALL OF BLACK SMOKE nearby. Keeps driving. Not his problem. 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           TRUCKLOADS of battle-hardened AL QAEDA FIGHTERS, race towards 
           the DATE PALMS. The WALL OF SMOKE AND FIRE a kilometer ahead.

           INT. MUD HUT - DAY

           PRIVATE PHILLIPS (19) peeks out at source of the SMOKE: A 
           DOWNED U.S. ARMY CHINOOK HELICOPTER. Sees Al Qaeda arrive.

           Blood seeps from Phillips leg; foot bent out at the wrong 
           angle. Charred uniform reads: ‘Mississippi National Guard’. 
           Holding SERGEANT BAYLIS (23). Awake, but in bad shape. Then 
           Phillips hears a noise, turns. GUN UP. Aimed at--

           -- IRAQI BOY (10), frozen at the door, terrified.  

                                 PHILLIPS
                        What do I do? The fuck do I do? 

           Phillips makes his choice. Gun drops; BOY instantly takes 
           flight. Phillips knows he just got both of them killed. 
           EXT. NEAR THE DATE PALMS - DAY

           Ten Al Qaeda surround the TWO AMERICANS as they’re dragged, 
           fighting, towards Trucks. Baylis grabs a branch. Holds on. 
           TALL AL QAEDA smashes his rifle butt down on Baylis’ temple--

           EXT. NEAR A TRUCK - MOMENT LATER

           -- the Soldiers are dropped in front of AL QAEDA LEADER. Pink 
           froth foams from Baylis’ mouth. Leader reads their uniforms.

                                 LEADER
                        Private Phillips. Welcome to--

           -- Leader’s head snaps to the side, bursting like a grape! 
           That’s what happens when a BULLET the size of a fucking 
           pineapple juice can hits your skull at a kilometer a second. 
           Another Insurgent takes a bullet that rips him in half! 

           Insurgents drop. Yelling! Motioning towards a HILLTOP; 
           marking the sniper’s location as-- 

           EXT. WIDE ON THE VILLAGE - DAY

           -- MOST Al QAEDA jump in Toyotas, tear out towards the hill. 
           Baylis and Phillips are tossed into a BLUE TRUCK. This one 
           heads the opposite direction.   

           EXT. BLUE TRUCK - DAY 

           Phillips and Baylis in the back bed. TWO AL QAEDA GUARDS jab 
           them with their guns. Pissed about their pals getting waxed. 
           In front, DRIVER and NAVIGATOR crest a rise, slow down for--

           A ROADBLOCK AT THE EDGE OF TOWN

           Twin posts; sagging chain slung between. TWO BEARDED MILITIA 
           visible. ONE sits on a plastic chair. Leaning against a wall. 
           TWO eats Hummus. Half on the plate, half in his beard. 

           Driver yells in Arabic. Militia Two moves to lift the chain--
           Al Qaeda Guard looks at Militia One-- then his head slips off 
           the wall. Neck snapped. Guard looks back-- at Militia Two--

           -- who slams the hummus plate on the windshield with his left 
           hand, blocking the view up front. PISTOL in his right hand-- 

           --PO-POP! Two nearly instantaneous head shots kill both 
           Insurgents in back. Aims back at Driver and Navigator; both 
           freeze. Operators, in enemy territory can’t take prisoners. 
           Even if their hands are up. PO-POP! He executes them. Nothing 
           morally clean about these killings.   
           UNDER ONE OF THE CORPSES-- Phillips is covered until it’s 
           lifted away. Militia Two is Court. Eyes Phillips’ leg while 
           wiping the hummus from his beard. Speaks American English--

                                 COURT
                        Get in the passenger seat--

           Court feels BAYLIS’ NECK. Breathing is too shallow, too fast. 

                                 PHILLIPS
                        I’ll stay back with Baylis.

                                 COURT
                        Not a request, kid.

           INT. BLUE TOYOTA - MOMENT LATER

           Court’s driving like a bat out of hell.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        There might be others.
                             (Court shakes his head)
                        How do you know?
                             (Court doesn’t answer)
                        Because you’re the sniper?
                             (no answer)
                        You’re Special Forces then? 

                                 COURT
                        Enough with the questions. 

           Phillips sees Baylis: rolling around. Starts to climb back--

                                 COURT
                        You want to survive, don’t climb 
                        around with a fractured Tibia. Nick 
                        an artery, you’re dead, and I’ll be 
                        spending the next two days evading 
                        those shitheads for no reason.  

           Court checks the REAR VIEW MIRROR. Phillips sees DUST RISING--

                                 PHILLIPS
                        That’s them?
                             (Court nods)
                        You got any morphine in your bag?

                                 COURT
                        You need to stay alert. When we get 
                        to those hills, I’m getting out, 
                        and you two will go on alone.
                                 PHILLIPS
                        We got a FOB at Tal-afer. It’s 
                        where we were heading when--

                                 COURT
                        -- I know; can’t go there.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Why not? They’ll give you a medal.

           Court’s withering look shuts him up. 

           EXT. FOOTHILLS - SIDE OF THE ROAD - GLOAMING

           Court checks Baylis. Yanks a Keffiyah from an insurgent.

                                 COURT
                        He never had a chance. 
                             (hands him the scarf)
                        Wrap that around your face. 

           Court begins to strip Baylis’ BODY ARMOR, nothing sentimental 
           about survival. Phillips falls apart now. Tears and snot. 

                                 PHILLIPS
                        My fault. Fuck. My fault. I got him 
                        out of the wreck. He was okay-- 
                        then this-- kid-- I knew he’d tell--

           Court straps his backpack on. Gathers his weapons. 

                                 PHILLIPS
                        -- what would you have done? 

           Phillips needs encouragement. Court looks human for a moment.

                                 COURT 
                        Same thing you did.

           Phillips nods. Means a lot to a young, scared soldier.

                                 COURT
                        FOB is due North, fifteen Klicks. 
                        Keep that AK in your lap, mags next 
                        to you. Don’t speed. Don’t stand 
                        out. Shoot anything you don’t like. 
                        Get your mind around that. You’re 
                        gonna have to get real nasty to 
                        survive the next half-hour. 

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Yes sir. What about you? 
                                 COURT
                        Already nasty, Private. 

           Phillip’s mouth opens, clear he’s going to thank him--

                                 COURT
                        -- thank me by getting the fuck 
                        home and forgetting my face. Go. 

           Phillips nods. Floors it, and we DISSOLVE TO--

           INT. POSH OFFICE - PARIS - SUNSET

           -- Kurt Reigel, BUZZED through GUARDED DOORS marked ‘RISK 
           MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS’. OLDER ANALYST hands Reigel PAGES. 
           Falls into step beside him as Reigel reads--

                                 REIGEL
                        -- six contacts, and none of them

                        Either CIA ran it clean for once,

                        Let’s keep the myth-building to a 
                        minimum; the probability he got 
                        this good on his own is near zero; 
                        it’s safe to assume he was trained 
                        by a Special Operations Unit--

           EXT. IRAQ - OVERLOOKING A MARSH - SUNSET

           -- FOUR AL QAEDA jumping out of an OLD MERCEDES. MORE stand 
           at the edge, boot-prints leading into THE MARSH--

           COURT-- watches AL-QAEDA wade across the marsh-- he doubles 
           back, carefully picking his way through REEDS-- then 
           submerges himself. Perfectly still. Can barely see his eyes.

                        troops engaging?
                             (Tech shakes his head)
                        If an American unit lost a man, 
                        Marines would’ve been out in force

           -- there can’t be more than a handful that like it. 

           INT. LOUSY CIA OFFICES - MOSUL - NIGHT

           Sharp contrast to Reigel’s palatial digs. Dirty COFFEE MUGS, 
           a layer of dust. But the office of TRENT ARCHER (30’s) a 
           sharp-lookin’ Texan with a teak-hard physique-- is spotless. 

           He’s reading an ‘INCIDENT REPORT’ on the downed helicopter.

           INT. CENTCOM OFFICE LOBBY - MOSUL - NIGHT

           -- at a metal detector, Archer empties his pockets, WALLET, 
           and a FERRARI RED CELL PHONE (distinctive looking). Swipes 
           his ‘CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY’ ID. Name: ‘TRENT ARCHER’. 
           Heads out into the hot, sweaty night. 

           EXT. DINGY 1960’S STYLE RESTAURANT - MOSUL - NIGHT

           AMERICANS and EUROS relax in a Military Contractor/News Media 
           watering hole. Archer heads towards a bathroom as a well-
           endowed FRENCH WOMAN in conservative clothes exits, they bump 
           into each other--    

                                 ARCHER
                        Looking mighty fine, Elaine. 
                             (nods to her chest)
                        You gonna let those midgets out to 
                        breathe sometime?

                                 ELAINE
                        Stuff it, Archer. 
           He couldn’t care less. Especially when he checks his pocket 
           and finds THE FLASHDRIVE she slipped him. 

           EXT. MARSH - NIGHT

           Court, stock-still, in the exact same spot he was before 
           watches FLASHLIGHTS move around in little clusters. None 
           close. Finally moves for the first time in hours. 

           EXT. THE ROAD - NIGHT

           AL-QAEDA DRIVER-- smokes, looking out over the bog as COURT 
           steps up behind him, KNIFES through the vocal chords. Not 
           silent, like you’d expect, but real. Air hisses out. Sad 
           moans. COURT, covered in wet mud, hops in the drivers seat. 
           Backs down the hill without turning over the engine--

           INT. ARMY HOSPITAL - MOSUL - NIGHT

           Bustling with activity. Archer pushes past an ARMY DOCTOR-- 

                                 ARMY DOCTOR
                        He’s just come out of surgery--

                                 ARCHER
                        Five minutes, doc. May save another 
                        soldier’s life.

           INT. RECOVERY ROOM - EVENING

           Archer hovers over Private Phillips, hopped up on drugs--  

                                 ARCHER
                        Incident report’s been filed, makes 
                        your story official; apparently  
                        there’s a G.I.-lovin’ Arab super-
                        soldier running around Iraq. 

                                 PHILLIPS
                        I don’t know, man. He had a beard. 

                                 ARCHER
                        But spoke English?

           Archer stays friendly, even though his words aren’t--

                                 ARCHER
                        I’m CIA Assistant Station Chief 
                        here. Before that, I was liaison to 
                        the DOD for wet-work operations 
                        during Iraqi Freedom. Renditions, 
                        Congressionally deniable actions 
                        were my specialty.
           Phillips pales. Not in the same class as Archer and knows it.

                                 ARCHER
                        Every piece of body language you’ve 
                        exhibited tells me you’re lying. 
                        Before you get Court Marshalled--

                                 PHILLIPS
                        -- he made it clear he wasn’t hot 
                        on being tracked. 

                                 ARCHER

                                 PHILLIPS 
                        -- he saved my life. 

                                 ARCHER
                        I respect what you’re trying to do, 
                        but I got a man missing. His 
                        exfil’s compromised, and if I don’t 
                        get to him before those Saudi 
                        Missionaries, he’s gonna die in a 
                        bad way.  
                             (Phillips nods, sold)
                        You said he took off on foot; did 
                        you lie about his location?

           Phillips shakes his head: no. 

                                 ARCHER
                        How did he act, after he saved you? 

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Real pissed-off. Not about them-- 

                                 ARCHER
                        -- about stopping to help you?

           Phillips nods. Archer pulls out an IPAD. Slaps the FLASHDRIVE 
           in. A HUNDRED-FIFTY PHOTOS appear (clear the woman gave him 
           Reigel’s Interpol file on THE GRAY MAN)--

                                 ARCHER
                        Look closely at every single one.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        He’s your guy but you don’t know 
                        what he looks like? 
                                 ARCHER
                        I got four Delta Teams standing by 
                        to save his bacon, but I can’t get 
                        authorization to send ‘em based on 
                        your word. I need proof you’re 
                        telling me the truth. ID him, I 
                        save your savior. Want to keep

           Court, driving, sees the LIGHTS BEHIND him. Looks at his

                        Last act as a soldier was murdering 
                        his commanding officer in front of 
                        thirty witnesses. When CIA issued a

                        him, he disappeared.

                        Put it all together, no way it’s a

                                 ARCHER
                        I need more than you’re offering, 
                        since I’m gonna help you catch him.

                        Mr. Archer, we believe CIA hired 
                        the Gray Man for the hit. 

                                 ARCHER
                        No chance. We’d never destabilize 
                        Nigeria right now. 
                             (Reigel doesn’t respond)
                        I’ve spent ten years working with

                        If CIA finds him first, it’s no

                        I kept them in the dark. Both sides 
                        want him dead; I’d rather earn a

           FRATERNAL TWIN GRANDDAUGHTERS (saw them all in the opening 
           scene) are making PLAYDOUGH CREATIONS at the kitchen table. 

           CLAIRE (8), bright as a sunflower, has made a HAPPY BEAR with 
           a WREATH OF FLOWERS. 

           EVA (also 8) is the serious one, reflected in her SCOWLING 
           GIRL KNIGHT riding an ANGRY DRAGON. 
           Their mom enters: MIRANDA FITZROY (also from the opening), 
           dressed for a date. Intelligent, adorable, an unintentional 
           appeal that attracts the attention of everyone around her.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        You look like a princess, mummy.

                                 MIRANDA 
                        Thank you very much; I borrowed 
                        your Grandad’s clothes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No you didn’t!! 

                                 EVA
                        He only wears suits. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Come here girls.

           Speaks softly, so the girls think they’re keeping secrets--

                                 MIRANDA 
                        Remember what I told you?

                                 EVA
                        Grandad’s the oldest thing in 
                        England.

           Donald Fitzroy stifles his smirk--

                                 MIRANDA
                        Exactly. Which means?

                                 CLAIRE
                        He has to get lots of sleep.

           The girls kiss Miranda on the cheeks. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Now off to bed with you. 

           Eva and Claire moan and groan, but hurry off. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Thanks, Pop. Be back by midnight.

                                 FITZROY
                        Take your time. Hope he’s a prince. 

           We recognize Fitzroy’s voice, same man that called Court.
           EXT. FRONT OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Miranda Fitzroy walks away. FOUR MEN sit in an SUV. Watching. 

           INT. MIRANDA’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Fitzroy’s drinking scotch. Doing paperwork. Doorbell RINGS. 
           He heads DOWNSTAIRS. Opens the door to see Kurt Reigel and 
           THREE SUITED MEN facing off with FITZROY’S BODYGUARD. 

                                 FITZROY
                             (no warmth)
                        Kurt. It’s been a long time. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Before you were knighted. 

                                 FITZROY
                        An honorific of gentility; terribly 
                        ill-suited for a man like me. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Thirty years in MI-6 shouldn’t go 
                        unrewarded by the Queen. I’m sorry 
                        to track you down at your 
                        daughter’s home-- 

                                 FITZROY
                             (to his Bodyguard)
                        -- Clive, wait upstairs, please.  
                             (to Reigel)
                        We’ll go to my office. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Sorry. We need to move quickly. 

           The Three Suited Men all have GUNS in hand before Clive can 
           react. They handcuff him. Take Fitzroy’s phone--

                                 REIGEL
                        No need for concern. A few minutes 
                        of cooperation will make you 
                        millions. Then we’ll be on our way. 

           INT. MIRANDA’S LIVING ROOM- MINUTE LATER

           Reigel sits across from Fitzroy, eyes burning through him. 
           The Suited Men blend into the background. GUNS in hand. 

                                 REIGEL
                        I need to find Court Gentry.
                                 FITZROY
                        Long time since I’ve heard that 
                        name. What kind of trouble has he 
                        gotten into?

                                 REIGEL
                        You should know. You vet his 
                        contracts, supply his logistical 
                        needs, assist with intelligence, 
                        payment, extraction. 

                                 FITZROY
                        Where did you hear this nonsense? 

                                 REIGEL
                        We know Gentry is the Gray Man. We 
                        know you’re his handler. We know he 
                        stirred up a hornet’s nest in Iraq, 
                        and now he’s on the run. Which 
                        means we can end this quickly.

                                 FITZROY
                        Who told you all of this?

                                 REIGEL
                        The Nigerians caught a break 
                        identifying him, so I put out word 
                        I wanted the Gray Man for a job. 
                        Had a meeting with one of your cut-
                        outs this afternoon. Ring a bell?

           Fitzroy doesn’t react. Reigel hands him a FILE--

                                 REIGEL
                        Threats and force got us up the 
                        chain before they could warn you. 

           -- PHOTOS OF: FOUR BRITISH MEN (young, old, fat, skinny)-- 
           bloodied up, tortured. TODAY’S NEWSPAPER next to all of them.

                                 REIGEL
                        They haven’t seen any faces, so 
                        they can be still be released. We 
                        are prepared to give you five 
                        million pounds in exchange for 
                        assistance neutralizing Gentry.

                                 FITZROY
                        I would never betray one of my own. 

                                 REIGEL
                        I’ll sweeten the pot. 
                                 FITZROY
                        The flavor doesn’t matter when it 
                        is the stew itself I don’t fancy. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Mrs. Fitzroy passed away a couple 
                        years ago, now it’s just your 
                        daughter and the twins?

           Fitzroy is expertly hiding his rage, fury, and fear. 

                                 FITZROY
                        You so much as give my girls a 
                        start, I’ll stuff your bloody 
                        stones down your throat. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Unfortunately for you, this isn’t a 
                        two-man dance. 

                                 FITZROY
                        Of course not. You control the 
                        black machinery of a sixty billion 
                        dollar conglomerate--

                                 REIGEL
                        -- then you understand who you’re 
                        really dealing with. LaurentGroup’s 
                        revenues outstrip the GDP of most 
                        countries. Any assistance you seek 
                        in her Majesty’s government will be 
                        overridden at the highest level--

           -- Fitzroy hears a CREAK, the Girls come out --

                                 FITZROY
                        -- girls, in your beds now. 
                        Everything’s fine. 

           Reigel has stepped around a corner. So have HIS MEN. Watching 
           Fitzroy, but invisible to the TWINS as they plod back to bed.

                                 REIGEL
                        There are eight men around your 
                        house. Phone lines and security 
                        have been adjusted. Your daughter 
                        and her date are being followed. 

                                 FITZROY
                        Where is my bodyguard? 

                                 REIGEL
                        His life is in your hands. Same as 
                        your cut-outs. Give me Gentry. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 REIGEL (cont'd)
                        Keep your family safe. Get rich. 
                        Never have to watch your back. Or. 
                        Things will get heavy. Fast. 

           EXT. THE ABANDONED AIRFIELD - NIGHT

           Inky blackness. Hearing the low hum of a hulking LOCKHEED L-
           100 cargo plane. Lights off. Hard to spot. Waiting in-- 

                               - NORTHWESTERN IRAQ -       

           The rear ramp is down, surrounded by FIVE PROFESSIONAL 
           MERCENARIES. Throat mics. Night vision goggles. Body armor. 

                                 MERC #1
                        Guy’s supposed to be hot shit, but 
                        can’t make his exfil on time? 

                                 MERC #2
                        If this is Fitzroy’s best man, he’s 
                        the guy who killed Milosevic. Snuck 
                        into a U.N. jail and poisoned him. 

                                 MERC #3 
                        I heard he did that job in Kiev. 

                                 MERC LEADER
                        No way Kiev was a one man OP. 
                        Twelve man A-Team, minimum. 

                                 MERC #3
                        Heard it was one guy, too. 

           A crackle in earpieces. Mercs toggle buttons on chest rigs--

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        T-- sec--d out. Com--g i- hot. --e-
                        st corner. Hold y--r fi--. 

           MERC GREEN NIGHT VISION - POV

           -- spinning to mark a LOUSY TRUCK smashing through a fence, 
           moving fast. Shot-to-shit, pluming smoke. No lights. 

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        I’m dragging four. 

           HEADLIGHTS in it’s wake. First two sets, then FOUR. 

           EXT. ON THE TARMAC - MOMENT LATER

           Court leaps out. The L-100 is already moving, Mercs stand on 
           the back ramp. Covering Court as he sprints aboard. 
           THE PLANE PICKS UP SPEED, ACCELERATING. REAR DOOR CLOSES-- 

           INT. REAR CARGO BENCH - NIGHT

           Merc Leader kneels by Court, who pulls his helmet off. Sweat 
           streams from his filthy beard. Can hardly lift his body. 

                                 MERC LEADER
                        You hurt? 

                                 COURT
                        I’m good. 

                                 MERC LEADER
                        Once in Turkey, we’ll take you to a 
                        safehouse and watch your back until 
                        Fitzroy can arrange a pickup. 

                                 COURT
                        I appreciate it. 

           The other FOUR MERCS stare at Court. Trying to reconcile this 
           normal-sized guy with his superhuman reputation. 

           INT. MIRANDA FITZROY’S FLAT - NIGHT

           PILOT’S RADIO CHATTER coming from Fitzroy’s LAPTOP. A SAT 
           PHONE ready. It chirps. Reigel watches.

                                 FITZROY
                        Standstill. How copy, Fullcourt?

                                 MERC LEADER (O.S.)
                        Five-by-five Standstill. We have 
                        the package and are wheels up. 

                                 FITZROY
                        Understood. Status of package?

           INTERCUT WITH PLANE AS NECESSARY

                                 MERC LEADER
                        Looks like shit, sir.

                                 FITZROY
                        Wait one.

            Weight of the world as Fitzroy makes his choice--

                                 FITZROY
                        Fullcourt, there has been a change 
                        in the operation. Cancel delivery.
                                 MERC LEADER
                        Negative, Standstill. We can’t 
                        return. Airfield is too hot.

                                 FITZROY
                        Not what I mean. I need you to 
                        destroy the package. 

           INT. BACK COMPARTMENT - MINUTE LATER

           Merc Leader, eyes Court in the back, snoozing. Merc Leader 
           holds up two fingers to his men. All switch to CHANNEL TWO.

           ON COURT

           Sees Merc Leader. Standing outside the cockpit. Other Mercs 
           have shifted positions. Reads their faces. Not decompressing. 

                                 COURT
                        Whatever you’re all thinking--

           -- weapons snap up. Court’s reaction is instant. As Merc 
           Leader FIRES, Court’s already pushing off, diving towards a 
           PALLET OF GEAR-- but a BULLET rips into his thigh! 

           BEHIND THE PALLET--- Court doesn’t pause at all, just keeps 
           running past it-- BLASTS Merc #2 in the face. One down. 

           Mercs open fire as Court spins back behind the pallet. HOLES 
           IN THE FUSELAGE begin to SCREAM as pressurized air squeezes 
           out, ripping metal. Each hole growing larger by the second. 

           INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

           PILOTS hear the GUNFIRE, see the pressure gauges spinning. 
           Shove their yokes in, sending the plane into a steep dive.

           INT. CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS

           Holes still expanding; but pressure drops as the plane dives. 
           Now a weightless environment. Court slams up against the 
           roof, tumbles along it, towards the rear ramp, now the 
           highest point in the cargo compartment. 

           MERC #3 AND #4-- floating in the air, fire up-- 

           -- COURT, reels as two bullets stitch across his chest plate. 
           Force of the impact knocks him back. Upside down; marks Merc 
           #5 below. Never unstrapped, he’s hanging helplessly. COURT 
           drills a double tap through his neck. Two down.

           MERC LEADER-- near the cockpit, arm anchored to webbing. Aims 
           UP AT COURT-- who’s tumbling near the top rear of the plane, 
           thirty feet above. Mercs fly into his line of fire. 
           Merc Leader has to push off. RISING UP LIKE SUPERMAN! Aiming 
           at Court, but waiting for his men to fly out of the way.

           COURT sees him. FIRES straight down. Killing Merc Leader. 
           Three down. Two to go. Pilots take the plane out of the dive, 
           and just that fast everyone SLAMS DOWN ONTO THE FLOOR! 

           Court drills his hip, Merc #4 slams right down on him. Merc 
           #4 doesn’t get his wits back fast enough; Court twists his 
           neck. CRUNCH! Scratch four. 

           Merc #3 dives towards the cockpit-- into the galley. Court 
           grabs a RIFLE off the floor, combat glides forward. 

           Rear Door parts with a HOWL, plane noses up into a steep 
           climb. Court loses his feet, dropping back toward the rear 
           doors, opening. Court smashes into the bottom of the CARGO 
           DOORS before they part all the way, lunges for webbing as-- 

           Merc #3 reappears out of the galley, wearing a PARACHUTE. 
           Uses the moment to fire down the cargo bay at-- 

           COURT-- hanging on webbing. Legs dangle out to nothing. Marks 
           Merc #3 flying down, towards him. Sees the parachute. 

           Fuselage has had it. Roof rips off. Court dives! Times it 
           perfectly. His momentum transfers to Merc #3, smashing his 
           head against the side of the plane, and then--  

           THEY’RE FREE-FALLING IN THE DARK 

           ROAR of engines replaced by a HOWLING WIND. Court holds on to 
           unconscious Merc #3 for dear life. Spinning down. Court, 
           behind him, slides his arms through the chute’s shoulder 
           strap. Hooks his legs round his torso. Spinning fast.  

           BEEEEEP! The Cypress Automatic Activation Device pops the 
           reserve chute at 700 feet. WHOOSH, they decelerate. Not over 
           yet. The parachute is not designed for two people-- 

           SPINNING DOWN -- FASTER -- PINWHEELING 

           -- with no reference point, sky and ground look the same. 
           Court senses they should be getting close. Spots the ground--
           seconds to impact; yanks a lead line, changes the angle. 
           CRUNCH! Lands squarely on Merc #3 as we SMASHCUT TO--

           INT. MIRANDA’S FLAT - CONTINUOUS

           -- Reigel and Fitzroy. Listening to Radio Static.
                                 FITZROY
                        After six days in the field, he was 
                        ambushed by a tier-one team moments 
                        before his plane disintegrated at 
                        17,000 feet. I’m quite sure I have 
                        fulfilled my end of the bargain. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Only when we have confirmation of 
                        his death. Not before.

           EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

           Court rolls off Merc #3’s CORPSE. Impact caved the guy’s 
           ribcage in. Court searches him, finds a BLOW OUT BAG (fancy 
           medical kit). Drops his own pants. Checks his gunshot wound. 
           Passed right through his thigh. Bleeding. Gruesome. 

           Bandages himself, then strips Merc #3’s pants off. Dons them. 
           Rips his own pants; revealing PASSPORTS and MONEY sewn into 
           the lining. On the horizon he sees the purple hint of dawn. 
           Court starts limp-jogging off.

           INT. MIRANDA’S FLAT - PRE-DAWN

           DOOR CRACKS. Soft footsteps on stairs. Reigel and Two Guards 
           shift behind doors as MIRANDA rounds the stairwell.

                                 MIRANDA
                        What are you still doing up?

                                 FITZROY
                        I should ask you the same question.

                                 MIRANDA
                             (teasing him)
                        If you like, I’ll fix up some tea 
                        and tell you all the details. 

                                 FITZROY
                        God no. I was just reminiscing.

           She walks over. Kisses him on the forehead.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Good night. Thank you. 

           She strolls away. Fitzroy relieved she didn’t see anyone.

           EXT. OPEN DESERT - KURDISTAN - MORNING

           PLANE WRECKAGE SMOLDERS a half-mile away. FOUR LOCALS wave a 
           JEEP over. 
           It skids to a stop next to MERC #3 (guy Court landed on). 
           RESEARCH GUY examines him. Pull his clothes back, sees the 
           crushed ribcage. Makes a call.

           INT. MIRANDA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           She’s sleeping. DOOR BURSTS OPEN. THREE MEN in masks rush the 
           room. Guns right at her. Speaking in a terrifying whisper-- 

                                 MASKED MAN
                        Want us to wake the twins this way, 
                        or get them up yourself?

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Miranda (no mask yet) holds Eva and Claire, both have creepy 
           SENSORY DEPRIVATION MASKS on. EAR and EYE COVERS, so they 
           can’t see or hear. MIRANDA passes FIVE MASKED GUARDS, enters-- 

           THE LIVING ROOM-- sees Fitzroy, zip-tied on the floor. 
           BLOODIED. Still struggling. Before Miranda can do anything, 
           MEN snatch the girls, YANK A MASK ON HER, and we CUT TO-- 

           REIGEL-- whispering to Fitzroy as he’s lifted to his feet.

                                 REIGEL
                        We’re going to a secure location 
                        where you will assist in the hunt--

           EXT. HIKING UP A RIDGE - MORNING

           Court, panting, dehydrated-as-hell, sees a PAVED ROAD below. 
           Miles behind him, a plume of smoke from the plane is visible. 

                                 REIGEL (CON’T O.S.)
                        -- every safehouse, every 
                        associate, every weapons cache, 
                        every hunch you’ve got will be used 
                        against him. Your girls will see no 
                        faces, hear no voices. Soon as 
                        Gentry’s dead, they’ll be released.  

           INT. OPEN-TOP HUMVEE - PAVED ROAD - DAY

           TWO YOUNG KURDISH SOLDIERS on patrol slow down. They see 
           COURT, limping in from the dusty desert. Court waves. 

                                 KURDISH OFFICER #1
                        (Look at his walk. Injured, yet 
                        confident. He is Delta Force.)

                                 KURDISH OFFICER #2
                        (SAS. I am certain.)
           They hop out. Friendly. Court motions for water. He drinks.

                                 COURT
                        Did I make it to Kurdistan?

           They both nod. Spotty English, but they make a go--

                                 KURDISH OFFICER #1
                        What happens with you?

                                 COURT
                        Ran my truck into a ditch. 

           INT. OPEN-TOP HUMVEE - DAY

           Officer #1 looks back at Court, pants down. MEDICAL KIT OPEN. 
           SEWING his own leg up. Officer #1 mouths: Delta Force. 

           INT. ENTERING TOWN - DAY

           Kurdish Officer #1 lays on the horn as PEOPLE pass in front 
           of him. Surrounded by traffic, they look behind them, 
           surprised to see-- Court’s gone, and we DISSOLVE TO-- 

           EXT. HUGE CHATEAU - DAY 

           Massive grounds. VINEYARDS. APPLE ORCHARDS. Everything 
           wonderful about the countryside in--

                                 - NORMANDY, FRANCE -

           -- A HELICOPTER lands on an ACRE OF LAWN as--

           INT. CHATEAU HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           -- Trent Archer watches. GUARDS open the door for Reigel. 
           Heads out first. Then Fitzroy helps Miranda, Eva, and Claire 
           out. All three girls wearing the SENSORY DEPRIVATION MASKS. 

           Archer stares at the children. Doesn’t like this one bit. 

           EXT. MAIN CHATEAU ENTRY - DAY

           Reigel walks towards Archer. Hand out--

                                 REIGEL
                        Mr. Archer. Your theory was spot 
                        on. 

           Archer takes the hand. Wary. Fitzroy watches their exchange--

                                 ARCHER
                        The fuck is this? Those are kids.
                                 REIGEL
                        They’re leverage. No need to fret. 
                        Do your job, they’ll be released. 
                             (hands Archer a mask)
                        Follow the guards upstairs and see 
                        that they get settled.
                             (Fitzroy approaches)
                        Sir Donald, our SAD specialist who 
                        burned your man. You two play nice.

           Reigel steps away. Answers a call. Archer follows Guards, 
           with the girls, and Fitzroy up a LONG WOODEN STAIRCASE--

                                 FITZROY
                        You registered surprise when you 
                        saw my girls. You haven’t worked 
                        with Reigel before, have you? 
                             (Archer doesn’t answer)
                        There’s a physiological response 
                        that occurs when a true psychopath 
                        reveals himself. It’s a universal 
                        response, like ants under the skin. 
                        When you feel it from Reigel, 
                        you’ll know you’re as dead as I am.

           INT. BEDROOM - CHATEAU - DAY

           Guards lead Fitzroy into a BEAUTIFUL ROOM. Archer dons the 
           mask, nods to Fitzroy, he removes the masks from the girls. 
           Claire’s been crying. Eva hasn’t. She glares at the Masked 
           Men. Swelling from Fitzroy’s beat-down on display. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Grandad. What happened to you?

                                 FITZROY
                        Had an accident, lass. I’m fine. 

                                 EVA
                        No you didn’t. They did it. 

                                 FITZROY
                        This is no time for games. Do 
                        exactly as you’re told. We are not 
                        trying to catch the people doing 
                        this, we are trying to survive. 

           Miranda and Fitzroy step away from the girls. Whispers--

                                 MIRANDA
                        It was warm outside; they took us 
                        over the channel--
                                 FITZROY
                        -- take your Sherlock cap off. The 
                        masks are for your protection. If 
                        you see anything that can implicate 
                        them, that’s it. Best case 
                        scenario, they get what they’re 
                        after, then they’ll interrogate you 
                        and the girls-- 

           Miranda recoils, Fitzroy pushes on. Gravely serious--

                                 FITZROY
                        -- if you know nothing, they’ll be 
                        able to release you. You must 
                        suppress everything you think you 
                        learned from me, and simply control 
                        the girls. Especially Eva.  

           Miranda nods. Gathers Claire and Eva close. Momma-bear. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Most times the things I ask you to 
                        do make sense, don’t they?
                             (they nod)
                        But every once in a while, I ask 
                        you to do something that doesn’t. 
                        We’re in a tight spot; the most 
                        helpful thing you can do to help-- 
                        is nothing. Can you do that for me?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Nothing? I can do that. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Wonderful. Eva? 

                                 EVA
                        I’ve never seen Grandad scared. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        He’s got a plan to get us home.

                                 EVA
                        What is it, then? 

           EDGES OF ARCHER’S EYES crinkle. Impressed. He heads out.

           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY - DAY

           Archer enters a huge, old-school Library. Immense fireplace, 
           flanked by rare cognac on one side, the MODERN WORLD on the 
           other. COMPUTERS, PLASMA SCREENS, manned by a COMPUTER TECH. 
           Reigel nods at Tech. He brings up a screen map: NORTHWESTERN 
           IRAQ and SOUTHERN TURKEY. An OVERLAY shows the search area--

                                 REIGEL
                        Plane went down here. We tracked 
                        him to a highway, but he would have 
                        left the area immediately--

                                 ARCHER
                        Four days left, and he could be 
                        anywhere? 

           Tech points to a CG GLOBE, marked with FLAGS-- 

                                 TECH
                        All Gentry’s safehouses and caches. 

           Reigel points-- to a SECOND MAP. Shows A FLAT VIEW OF THE 
           WORLD-- countries with LAURENTGROUP offices are highlighted.

                                 REIGEL
                        We have branch offices in 40 
                        countries; I have direct contact 
                        with their security services. One 
                        lead, his world shrinks quickly.

                                 ARCHER
                        Who’s gonna take him out?

                                 REIGEL
                        We have five teams standing by. 
                        When we get a location, we encircle 
                        the target, and spring the trap.

                                 ARCHER
                        They better be good.

                                 REIGEL
                        With proper incentives, you can use 
                        the best Special Forces units a 
                        corrupt country has.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - SYRIA - DAY

           FOUR HAWKISH MEN study maps. Long and lean from their faces 
           to their feet. A pound of fat between them.  

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        Pakistani SSG. Green Beret-trained 
                        Waziri’s from the tribal areas. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 REIGEL (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        Stamina and stealth border on the 
                        inhuman. They will run point if 
                        Gentry hides in the wilderness. 

           EXT. CAFE IN ATHENS - DAY

           TWO SERBIAN SPECIAL BRIGADE sit. Watching passerbys. Drinking 
           water. No booze on duty. Thick, muscular, scary. FOUR MORE 
           walk down the street towards a COP, who eyes them. Looks 
           uncomfortable. These Serbs have that effect on everyone.

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        Serbian Special Brigade; especially 
                        good with knifes and subsonic 
                        weaponry. Best used in public 
                        areas; I’ve seen them hit a target 
                        and disappear before bystanders 
                        even noticed the corpse. 

           INT. RUN-DOWN APARTMENT - GEORGIA - DAY 

           SIX LEBANESE load CLIPS for assault rifles. Their fingers are 
           a blur. Perfect execution from a decade of experience. Oiling 
           WEAPONS, changing batteries on NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        Lebanese Hezbollah, trained by 
                        Iranian Special Forces. May not be 
                        the most skilled, but they offer 
                        two unique advantages: they get 
                        caught, law enforcement will 
                        automatically default to a 
                        terrorism investigation-- 

           TWO LEBANESE move towards a window. Look out on a BAR filled 
           with GEORGIANS watching football. Drinking. Carrying on. 

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        And second--

                                 ARCHER (O.S.)
                        -- they’ll go after police. 

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        Yes. Unlike SSG, their unit is 
                        composed of brain-washed fanatics 
                        who think they’ll be rewarded for 
                        killing the Godless. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           WIDE ON THE CABIN-- flying through a thunderstorm. PASSENGERS 
           look terrified. Can’t tell who the GROM units are-- 
                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        I’ve also secured the services of a 
                        Russian GROM unit; the Kremlin’s 
                        answer to Delta-Force. 

           -- then the plane suddenly drops eighty feet. Everyone 
           screams-- except the FIVE RUSSIAN GROM OPERATORS-- sitting 
           separately from each other. Their lack of fear makes them 
           easy to pick out despite moustaches and long hair. 

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        They excel at virtually every facet 
                        of covert operations including a 
                        mastery of linguistics and cultural 
                        norms; allows them to blend into 
                        nearly every European country.  

           A DRINK CART busts loose. GROM #1 grabs it as it sweeps down 
           the aisle. FLIGHT ATTENDANT unbuckles to track it down. 
           Staggering. Holding on. GROM #2 watches her. Plane drops, she 
           falls. He catches her. Glances at her face, and one-hands the 
           BARF BAG open, and under her mouth just in time.  

           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY - DAY

           Archer takes it all in. Impressed with the set-up. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Each of their unit commanders will 
                        be paid a million Euros, plus 
                        expenses. Whatever team succeeds in 
                        killing the Gray Man and recovering 
                        his body within the next four days, 
                        will earn an extra ten million.

                                 ARCHER
                        You’re turning it into a game?

                                 REIGEL
                        No. If we succeed, the likelihood 
                        is that we will do it through 
                        attrition. Sapping Mr. Gentry’s 
                        strength, resources, and health. 

                                 ARCHER
                        That’s only four. Who’s the fifth?

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 

           THE KOREAN is studying EVERYTHING Fitzroy gave Reigel on 
           ‘Gentry, Court’. He’s shirtless. Turning pages with his LEFT 
           HAND, an ORANGE and a KNIFE in his RIGHT HAND. Rolling the 
           orange without even looking, slicing the peel one handed-- 
                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        An independent contractor from 
                        North Korea. Personally, I’d put 
                        his skills on par with Gentry’s. 

           When the orange is perfectly peeled in ONE STRIP, he takes a 
           delicate nibble; an amazing display of casual dexterity.    

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        Of course, the Korean has one 
                        sizeable advantage--

           INT. UGLY EASTERN BLOCK AIRPORT - MORNING

           Court in line at CUSTOMS, hands his PASSPORT over. Name is 
           ‘Francois Janet’. PHOTO SHOWS: Court with a trimmed beard.

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        -- the Gray Man has no idea who’s 
                        hunting him.

           EXT. ESTABLISHING - DAY

           Looking down on the medieval city of--

                          - SAMOBAR, CROATIA -  

           Red-roofed storybook houses; a gorgeous place. 

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Court’s sleeping. Trimmed his beard to match the Passport. 
           Medical supplies around him. Leg has been re-stitched. 

           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY - DAY

           Guards lead Fitzroy into the COMMAND HUB AREA. He glances at 
           the open SAD DOSSIER. Then at Archer-- 

                                 FITZROY
                        What’s the going rate for turning 
                        traitor these days?

                                 ARCHER
                        Ask your boy Court. 

                                 REIGEL
                        You’ve given us a list of all his 
                        caches, contacts, etc?
                             (Fitzroy nods)
                        What’s his next move?

           Everything Fitzroy’s doing is emotionally complicated. 
                                 FITZROY
                        He hates flying over borders, since 
                        they scan his passport image. But 
                        he’ll take a flight this time. 
                        Needs to put distance between 
                        himself and the last point of 
                        contact. Odds are slim he’ll have 
                        new papers, so run the names I gave 
                        you. One is certain to pop up.  

           Reigel looks at Archer. He nods, it holds water. 

           EXT. CROATIAN FARMERS MARKET - DAY

           Court sorts PRODUCE. Looks at his WATCH.

           EXT. FRENCH CHATEAU - PATIO - DAY

           Fitzroy surveying the grounds. Reigel brings out Fitzroy’s 
           SAT PHONE, plugged into a DEVICE. Archer follows.

                                 ARCHER
                        He’ll use a sat phone with a 
                        randomized IMEI chip. You won’t be 
                        able to run a trace-- 

           Reigel knows this. Hands Archer a HEADSET. Reigel dons his 
           too. Device lets them listen in. Phone chirps. Right on time. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Find out why he saved the soldiers. 
                             (off Fitzroy’s look)
                        Selflessness is a glaring flaw.

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        You call that a rescue?

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY--

                                 FITZROY
                        The entire sector became a no-go 
                        zone after your little hero job. I 
                        had to hire a team that would do 
                        anything for money. What in God’s 
                        name were you thinking? 

                                 COURT
                        I was driving past, then I wasn’t. 
                        Felt good to do it, though. Better 
                        than I’ve felt in awhile.
                                 FITZROY
                        That’s two operations in a row 
                        you’ve let your emotions get the 
                        best of you. What’s going on?

                                 COURT
                             (earnestly)
                        I don’t know. 

                                 FITZROY
                        You’ll have plenty of time to think 
                        it through; my sources tell me that 
                        Isaac Abubaker wants you dead. 

                                 COURT 
                        He knows I did the job?

                                 FITZROY
                        Maybe you were recognized. Maybe 
                        someone sold me out. Most likely, 
                        the pieces were put together after 
                        you let Private Phillips of 
                        Mississippi see you in action fifty 
                        miles from Al Hasakah.

           ON COURT-- that sucks. Another reason not to trust anyone. 

                                 COURT 
                        The kid sold me out.

                                 FITZROY
                        Sorry. Shall I send another team?

                                 COURT
                        No. I’m clear. Let me know if you 
                        figure anything else out.

           As usual, Court just hangs up on him.

           INT. COURT’S FLAT - DAY

           TIGHT ON PINK FLESH. A KNIFE SLICING. GUTS pulled out. PULL 
           BACK. Fresh Salmon. Scaled. Filleted. Court makes perfect 
           cuts. Sets it in a sizzling skillet. Flawless chef technique.  

           INT. DINING TABLE - EVENING

           A gorgeous dinner for one. Plated beautifully. Enhances the 
           sense of loneliness as Court eats. No one to share it with. 

           INT. COURT’S FLAT - EVENING

           Frosting a small CAKE. Takes a piece out to the balcony. 
           Sits. Eats. Something unquantifiably sad about cake-for-one.
           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY - DAY

           The PASSPORT PHOTO of ‘FRANCOIS JANET’ is onscreen next to 
           the IMAGE Archer tracked down. Definitely Court.

                                 TECH
                        Entered Belgrade this morning. 

                                 REIGEL
                             (to Archer and Fitzroy)
                        Draw up a list of everyone he knows 
                        within three hundred kilometers. 

                                 FITZROY
                        He’s not in Belgrade. He’ll be in 
                        Samobar, Croatia.  

           Reigel looks at him, at a screen with STRIKE TEAM LOCATIONS--

                                 REIGEL
                        How many watchers can we get there?

                                 TECH
                        Within three hours, twenty.
                        Lebanese are closest--

                                 ARCHER
                        -- they’ll stand out. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Have the Serbians run point. 
                        Lebanese will back them up.

           INT. BEDROOM - CHATEAU - EVENING

           Eva hears something. Moves to the LOCKED WINDOW. They’re on 
           the third floor. A view of a wall across a courtyard.

                                 EVA
                        Those are church bells. They’re 
                        coming from there, right?
                             (Claire nods)
                        Well. If there’s a church, don’t 
                        you think, maybe, there’s a town? 

           EXT. STREETS OF SAMOBAR - NIGHT

           A WATCHER (50’s) sits in an OPEL. Eyes carefully scanning a 
           chokepoint on a bridge. Waiting. Hawking every PASSERBY. 
           INT. OPEL - NIGHT

           Don’t see the Watcher’s hands, hear him pissing in a bottle. 
           Sets it down next to more full bottles; that’s dedication. 
           Locks eyes on a MAN strolling over the bridge.  

           AT TWENTY FIVE METERS-- Court’s features take shape. The 
           watcher stares. Taking in everything. We SEE WHAT HE SEES: 

           CLOSE ON COURT’S FOOT-- as he steps down on his injured leg-- 
           CLOSER-- a slight tremble, invisible to the untrained eye. 

           INT. LOCAL BAR - NIGHT

           Place is busy. Court’s at the counter with his book. An open 
           seat beside him. Able to look behind him in a mirror. Habit. 
           Sees ATTRACTIVE SPANISH WOMAN (30’s) getting hit on by a 
           CROATIAN. Watches her as she sees the open seat, heads over.

                                 SPANISH WOMAN
                        Can you please act like I am coming 
                        back to you from the ladies room. 

           Court doesn’t do anything; the perfect response.  

                                 COURT
                        I’m not much of a talker.

                                 SPANISH WOMAN
                        What if I ask a question you can’t 
                        resist? 
                             (Court’s intrigued)
                        In five words, what is the coolest 
                        thing you have ever seen? 

                                 COURT
                             (thinking, then it comes)
                        Neil Armstrong-- on the moon.

                                 SPANISH WOMAN
                        You are much older than you look.

                                 COURT
                        I didn’t see it live. 
                             (smirks, first time)
                        Your Croatian is gone. 

           He starts to get up. She sags. Subtly wounded by rejection.

                                 SPANISH WOMAN
                        You are waiting for a date?  
                             (he shakes his head)
                        Married but removed your ring? Gay? 
                             (no)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SPANISH WOMAN (cont'd)
                        Ouch. I may not be Penelope Cruz, 
                        but to get rejected by a single 
                        male drinking alone. In English, 
                        you would say I have hit my bottom.

           She’s not whining, just good-natured self-deprecation.

                                 COURT
                        Rock bottom. How’d you know I spoke 
                        English?

           She points to his book, in English. 

                                 SPANISH WOMAN
                        Are you always so mysterious?

                                 COURT
                        I’m suspicious of assertive people. 

                                 SPANISH WOMAN
                        So am I. Usually. Two days ago my 
                        husband left me for his secretary.

                                 COURT
                        You’re way too young for that 
                        cliche. 

           She smiles. A sweet moment. Then, a look in her eyes; 
           sadness, kindness, something-- makes him disengage. 

                                 COURT
                        Fun, smart, and pretty; not a 
                        chance in hell you’ll get turned 
                        down twice tonight-- but I’m a 
                        lousy choice for your rebound.  

           She nods warmly. He places EUROS on the bar, heads out. Soon 
           as he’s gone. Her smile drops. Ominous. She heads towards the 
           BATHROOM. Tucks an EAR-BUD RADIO in her ear--

           INT. CITY METRO TRAIN - EVENING

           -- the train slows, SERBIAN #1 listens trough his EARBUD--

                                 SPANISH WOMAN (O.S. FILTERED)
                        Couldn’t keep him any longer. He’s 
                        walking towards the main station. 

           Train stops. Serbian #1 exits. Looks around the UNDERGROUND 
           TERMINAL. One stairwell for coming and going. He hangs back. 
           EXT. METRO ENTRY - EVENING

           Court descends into the bowels of the RAIL SYSTEM. Rounds a 
           corner, into a TUNNEL. Hard surfaces. Noisy with COMMUTERS. 
           Walks towards-- TWO LOVERS. Huggin’. Kissin’ while-- 

           KEEPING THEIR EYES ON SPECIFIC AREAS

           One scans the street in front, the other behind. The YOUNG 
           WOMAN sees Court; can’t hide her recognition fast enough. 

           COURT-- watches her stiffen. Reads a train arrival sign: 1 
           minute. Strolls past them. At the corner, he SPRINTS--

           FIVE FEET BEHIND HIM-- SERBIAN #2-- pulls his GUN, hustles to 
           the corner, peeks his head around to get a quick look-- 

           -- face-to-face with Court, burying a blade in the guy’s 
           NECK! As his corpse starts falling, Court grabs the GUN, 
           doesn’t come loose; called a death grip for a reason--

           TEN FEET IN FRONT OF COURT

           SERBIAN #3-- aims a GUN as Court drops, using the CORPSE as a 
           shield as Serbian #3 FIRES! Court finally wrests the gun free-
           - blasts a fist-sized hole in Serbian #3’s head, and tucks 
           his own head. In the REFLECTION OF GLASS, he sees BEHIND HIM--

           -- where SERBIAN #4 fires TWO BULLETS into Court’s exposed 
           back, but Court’s already spinning, FIRING-- killing Serbian 
           #4. No blood on Court’s back. Blackened Kevlar visible 
           through holes in his clothes as we CUT TO--

           THE TWO LOVERS

           -- happened so fast, they’re still running up the stairs-- 
           surrounded by panicked COMMUTERS. Court catches up, chops 
           Male Lover on the neck, shoves a gun in Girl’s side. Strips 
           her EARBUD. WHISPERS something in her ear, escorting her up 
           the steps. Nods for her to speak into her mic--

                                 GIRL
                        Target is on the platform, trying 
                        to time the next train.

           INT. UNDERGROUND STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Serbian #1 watches PANICKED PEOPLE. Carefully eyeing every 
           one of them. Stairwell is covered. Train arrival sign blinks 
           zero as wind hits ahead of the ARRIVING TRAIN-- 

           UNDER HIS JACKET-- he’s got a MACHINE PISTOL unbuckled in the 
           holster. All he needs is a target. But there’s no Court--
           EXT. ON THE STREET - MOMENT LATER

           SERBIAN #5 and #6 hurry towards the stairwell; heading down. 
           MACHINE PISTOLS up their coat sleeves, pushing PEOPLE out of 
           their way-- one of whom-- is COURT-- heading up the stairs. 
           Twenty feet ahead, he marks a YOUNG MAN at a bus stop--

                                 COURT
                        English, Francais, Italiano?

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Italiano. 

           Court, points up the street, speaks in ITALIAN--

                                 COURT
                        (I got a bum leg. My brother forgot 
                        his coat. Run the black Audi down?)

           Court’s holding out his COAT and a HUNDRED EUROS. Young Man 
           grabs it, takes off with the coat under his arm. 

           EXT. NEARBY PARK - MOMENT LATER

           SERBIAN #5 spots Young Man running away with Court’s COAT. 

           YOUNG MAN-- catches the Audi at a red light. A WOMAN DRIVER. 
           Confused, he turns back-- FOUR LEBANESE HEZBOLLAH surround 
           him. See he’s not Court. They spin and curse. 

           THE THREE REMAINING SERBIANS-- look furious. As POLICE stream 
           towards the station, they have no choice but to scatter. 

           INT. TAXI - EVENING

           Court’s in back. Driver cruising out of town-- 

                                 TECH (PRE-LAP)
                        Gentry killed half the Serbs. 

           -- his mood is very, very gloomy. 

                                 FITZROY (PRE-LAP)
                        He knows I betrayed him--

           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Fitzroy’s guilt is etched on ever wrinkle of his face.

                                 FITZROY
                        -- he’ll sever all contact with my 
                        network.

           Reigel stares at the PASSPORT PHOTO of COURT we saw earlier-- 
                                 ARCHER
                        Still needs clean papers; he’ll 
                        have to steal a passport.

                                 REIGEL
                        Short term fix. Once it’s reported, 
                        we’ll be able to track it. 
                             (points to the photo)
                        Get that to every forger within a 
                        days drive. Let them know we are 
                        willing to pay one million euros 
                        for the man in the photo.   

                                 ARCHER
                        If it gets to CIA, they’ll put Gray 
                        Man and Gentry together. They get 
                        him first, there won’t be a body. 

                                 REIGEL
                        If he slips out of Eastern Europe, 
                        he’s gone. Send it.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAMOBAR - NIGHT

           LATEX GLOVES pick a lock. Enter COURT’S FLAT-- A SHADOW steps 
           over to the curtains. Closes them, turns on a LIGHT.

           THE KOREAN looks around. Court didn’t leave much. Plates are 
           cleaned. He opens the FRIDGE. Leftovers. The sad cake. He 
           sniffs. A hunter. Getting a sense of his prey. 

           INT. TRAIN - PRIVATE COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Court has purchased a LAPTOP. Connected to a WI-Fi network. 
           On a WEBSITE, he inputs a CODE. MEDIA FILES. Last one first: 

           A THERMAL IMAGE (from the opening scene). Fitzroy in his 
           London office, looking into the CROSSHAIRS-- turning back-- 

                                 GIRLS 
                        Grandad! 

           -- hugging EVA and CLAIRE. MIRANDA steps in behind them. 

           When COURT took the footage, he wasn’t aiming a rifle, but a 
           LASER-AUDIO TRANSMITTER. Reading vibrations on the window. 

           IMAGE shows the Fitzroy’s having a tea party in his office. 
           Fitzroy’s doing his best to be dainty as he scoops sugar.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why is it that when sugar gets wet, 
                        ants love it, but they won’t touch 
                        it when it’s dry in the pot?
                                 FITZROY
                        Excellent question. Have you ever 
                        seen an ant wearing a cap?

                                 EVA 
                        Ants don’t wear hats.

                                 FITZROY
                        Not only do they not wear them, 
                        they hate them. Now-- what do you 
                        think this is?

           He lifts the SUGAR LID, puts it on his head like a hat. 
           Claire loves it. Eva heaves (tough crowd). Turns to Miranda.

                                 EVA
                        How come he always makes it up when 
                        he doesn’t have a proper answer?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Because his brain is composed 
                        entirely of feathers and string.

           Finally gets a giggle from Eva.

           BACK ON COURT-- lost in the images. His favorite thing.

           NEW FILE, going back in time: EVA and CLAIRE at 6, playing in 
           a PARK. Must’ve been shot from a BENCH with a ZOOM lens. Eva 
           hangs from a JUNGLE GYM-- Claire looks up fearfully. 

                                 EVA
                        Come on Claire, it’s not scary.

           OLDER FILE: Eva and Claire (5) at a zoo. Found a BUCKET of 
           filthy water, splashing it on their faces. Miranda hurries 
           over-- looks at the brown water-- 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Girls! What are you doing?

                                 EVA
                        We’re wetting our faces!

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah, we’re wetting our faces.

           EARLIER ONE: a BIRTHDAY PARTY, shot on a THERMALS, glowing 
           WHITE as the girls blow out FOUR CANDLES-- 

           BACK ON COURT-- watching all the history he’s got of Eva and 
           Claire’s life; been there for a sequence of moments. And for 
           the very first time, he looks worried. 
           EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           Court walks off the train. Through gorgeous, medieval--

                                 - PIRAN, SLOVENIA -     

           He pulls out the sat phone. Pauses, hesitant to call. 

           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY - NIGHT

           FITZROY’S SAT PHONE RINGS-- everyone looks at it, stunned. 
           Manna from heaven as they all don headsets--

                                 FITZROY
                        Surprised you called.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY WITH:

                                 COURT 
                        The only way to make this worse is 
                        by lying to me. Why? 

                                 FITZROY
                        Very few things could force me to 
                        betray a friend.

           Court sags, just a touch. Hard to ask--

                                 COURT
                        Your family?

           REIGEL-- presses a button on the console, mutes the call--

                                 REIGEL
                        Any chance he’d come in if he knew 
                        they were in danger?

                                 FITZROY
                        You don’t survive in this business 
                        as a Paladin-- 
                             (back into phone)
                        -- they haven’t been hurt. I’m 
                        trying to keep it that way. 

                                 COURT
                        Have they seen enough to ID anyone?

                                 FITZROY
                        No. They masked the girls for 
                        transport; haven’t let them hear 
                        any voices, either. If we manage to 
                        get you, they can be set free.  
                                 COURT
                        What if I came in?

           ON FITZROY-- definitely surprised by the question--

                                 FITZROY
                        You’d consider it?

                                 COURT
                        You’re certain it would save them?

                                 FITZROY
                        Yes. I’ll do whatever it takes to 
                        keep them safe. Why would you?

                                 COURT
                        Same reason I engaged in Iraq. Same 
                        reason I screwed up the hit before. 
                        It stacks up. 
                             (beat)
                        Where do they want to do it? 

           REIGEL scribbles something on a PAPER, Fitz reads it--

                                 FITZROY
                        Zrinkski Square. Zagreb. 6 AM. 

                                 COURT
                        I’ll be there. You and me, are we 
                        in the same boat here?

                                 FITZROY
                        We are indeed. 

           LINE GOES DEAD. Fitzroy looks stunned. Same with everyone. 

                                 ARCHER
                        Does he know your girls?

                                 FITZROY
                        Absolutely not.

                                 ARCHER
                        Can’t be that easy. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Maybe he’s a better man than you 
                        give him credit for. 

           EXT. ANCIENT WHITE BUILDING - PIRAN - NIGHT

           Court climbs over a railing from the house above. Peeks in a 
           window, sees a security system, but a side door’s open. 
           INSIDE 

           Walks down a hallway. Place is straight out of Architectural 
           Digest. Plasma screens. Eames furniture. Hell of a view. 
           Hears COUGHING. Nasty. Emphysema for sure. 

           MAURICE PATTON (70’s), an African-American in bad health, 
           sits at a table. Boozer nose. Smoking. TWO GUNS on a tray in 
           front of him next to scotch and coffee. A hand on his lap. 

                                 COURT
                        Hello, Maurice--

           Court looks at the guns--

                                 COURT
                        -- .38 police snubby. 1911. You 
                        ever check those at a saloon?

                                 MAURICE
                        Not since prohibition. 

           Court looks under the table. Sees a THIRD GUN pointed at him.

                                 MAURICE
                        People change. You did. 

                                 COURT
                        I didn’t sign up to get used. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Did you frag your fuckin’ C.O.?

                                 COURT
                        No. I snapped his neck. Guy had 
                        pliers in both hands, preaching 
                        Leviticus while bleeding out a 
                        fourteen-year-old kid who didn’t 
                        know a goddamned thing. This was in 
                        the street, with Iraqi’s watching.

           Maurice eases up. Puts his GUN on the table.

                                 MAURICE
                        Glad he was a nut. Place was 
                        medieval enough.

                                 COURT
                        What about you?

                                 MAURICE
                        White House politicizing of CIA; I 
                        kept getting in the way with reason 
                        and logic. Been out four years now. 
                                 COURT
                             (looks around)
                        Done well for yourself since.

                                 MAURICE
                        Picked up a few tricks hiding 
                        operation slush funds. Turns out 
                        legitimate enterprises pay pretty 
                        well for the exact same skills. 

                                 COURT
                        I’m in trouble. 

                                 MAURICE
                        That’s obvious. You look like shit.

           Maurice looks a whole lot worse. Both chuckle.

                                 COURT
                        Been a rough couple days. 

                                 MAURICE
                        I’ve seen you after a rough couple 
                        days, you’ve never looked this bad. 

                                 COURT
                        Not a kid anymore. 

                                 MAURICE
                        You never got to be a kid. 

           INT. MAURICE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Court’s at the counter. Maurice cooking. Washes a witches 
           brew of PRESCRIPTION DRUGS down with his coffee/scotch. 

                                 COURT
                        Emphysema? 

                                 MAURICE
                        For starters. Lungs, liver, my 
                        entire body’s metastasizing. 
                        Doctors give me six months. 

           Maurice is uncomfortable, so Court changes the subject.

                                 COURT
                        How’d you know I was coming?

                                 MAURICE
                        News floating around. Some kind of 
                        hunt. Third world intelligence 
                        agencies, first world bounty. Ten 
                        million Euros; 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAURICE (cont'd)
                        aren’t too many killers who could 
                        justify that price. When I heard 
                        about the shoot-out in Croatia, 
                        figured it might be you. Know who’s 
                        footin’ the bill?

                                 COURT
                        Isaac Abubaker. 

                                 MAURICE
                        You took out his brother? 
                             (Court nods)
                        Impressive hit. Who hired you?

                                 COURT
                        Hamilton and Associates, out of 
                        Switzerland.

           Court stiffens, sees Maurice’s PRETTY CARETAKER (50’s), 
           sleepy, climbing up an interior stairwell--

                                 MAURICE
                        Easy, kid. Just my caretaker. 

           Maurice heads towards her, they speak in Slovenian, she 
           touches his arm, looks at Court, back to Maurice. She turns 
           away; definitely something going on between them.  

                                 MAURICE
                        Sweet. Cute. And knows the score. 
                             (back to business)
                        Hamilton and Associates aren’t 
                        involved in Nigeria.

                                 COURT
                        We researched them, figured the 
                        odds were high they were fronting 
                        for either DGSE, or even CIA; 
                        ironic in any other business. 

                                  MAURICE
                        Gotten lazy; you always need to 
                        know who you’re working for. 

                                 COURT
                        Julius Abubaker controlled the 
                        cocaine smuggling route through 
                        Ginea-Bisseau and was brokering 
                        Uranium sales to Syria. At a 
                        certain point, the world’s a better 
                        place without some people in it, no 
                        matter who’s picking up the tab. 
                                 MAURICE
                        If you say so. What have they got 
                        on you? 
                             (off Court’s look)
                        They got something or you’d be in 
                        Borneo or Patagonia by now. 

           Court takes a moment, then--

                                 COURT
                        I have twin girls, Maurice.  

                                 MAURICE
                        You selfish motherfucker. 

           Maurice eyes him. Lays off. Court looks guilty enough. 

                                 MAURICE
                        They’ve been taken?
                             (Court nods)
                        Fuck are you doing here?

                                 COURT
                        Wanted to spend my last night 
                        having drinks with an asshole. 

           Gets a smirk out of Maurice.

                                 MAURICE
                        I’m your contingency plan?

                                 COURT
                        Hope it doesn’t come to that, but 
                        yeah. I need some things. Just in 
                        case.  

           EXT. BALCONY - PRE-DAWN

           Hell of a view. The Mediterranean sparkles in moonlight.

                                 MAURICE
                        How old are they?

                                 COURT
                        Eight.

           Maurice does the math-- 

                                 MAURICE
                        Not Miranda.

                                 COURT
                        They were an accident. 
                                 MAURICE
                        You accidentally slipped your dick 
                        in your handler’s daughter?

                                 COURT
                        I shook her hand, and I was done. 
                        We spent the next two years trying 
                        to stay away from each other. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Why keep working with Fitzroy?

                                 COURT
                        Best way to keep an eye on them; 
                        and if they were ever in jeopardy, 
                        I’d hand myself in; no questions. 
                        Fitzroy doesn’t know. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Ever met ‘em?

                                 COURT 
                        Never even spoken to them. Couldn’t 
                        take the risk.

                                 MAURICE
                        You sure ‘bout that?

           Court doesn’t answer. Putting a wall up--

                                 MAURICE
                        If I were a nice man, I’d keep my 
                        trap shut, considering what you’re 
                        facing in a few hours, but you blew 
                        this. You could’ve disappeared with 
                        her. Would’ve been the right thing.  

           Court looks out. Hard to read. He stands.

                                 COURT
                        Gotta get going, Maurice. 

           INT. THE DOOR - MINUTE LATER 

           Maurice hands Court a THICK ENVELOPE. Then CAR KEYS. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Zagreb, right? 
                             (Court nods)
                        Park it at the train station. I’ll 
                        pick it up later. 

                                 COURT
                        Thanks Maurice.  
                                 MAURICE
                        Thank me by getting the fuck out of 
                        here and forgetting my face.

           A smirk between them. An old bit, and we DISSOLVE TO--

           INT/EXT. COURT DRIVING - DAWN

           Red sky at sunrise. HUGE STORM CLOUDS to the WEST where--

           EXT. THE CHATEAU - DAWN

           -- the RAINSTORM pummels the grounds. Early GRAY LIGHT.

           INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - DAWN

           Fitzroy stands in the door. Watching. Sad. Claire wakes. 

                                 FITZROY
                        Back to sleep with you. 

           ON EVA-- eyes open. Watching her grandfather. He exits. Eva 
           stares at the rain. PULL FOCUS-- staring at the window.

           INT. CHATEAU HALLWAY - THIRD FLOOR - DAWN

           GUARD hears GLASS SHATTER. Pulls a mask over his face, throws 
           the door open to see Eva and Claire standing over a broken 
           MIRROR. Looks like it fell off the wall. 

           INT. CHATEAU LIVING ROOM - DAWN

           Reigel and Archer watch Fitzroy. They speak so he can’t hear--

                                 REIGEL 
                        We’ll have Fitzroy see the girls 
                        off. Then you’ll take him out.

                                 ARCHER
                        I didn’t sign up for some Kraut

                        I took your million; plenty to

           Reigel stares at Archer. A long moment. Reigel heads off.  
           Archer absentmindedly scratches his arm. Fitzroy calls out-- 

                                 FITZROY
                        -- felt that, didn’t you? The ants?
                        Medical term is Formication with an 
                        M. It’s an instinctive response to 
                        being hunted. Makes sense, since 
                        killing me was a test. You failed. 
                        Not too late to switch sides.
           INT. CHATEAU BEDROOM - DAWN

           The Twins load the mirror into a garbage bin. Guard carries 
           it out. The CURTAIN over the window shifts, blown by wind. 

           GUARD locks the door behind him, EVA pulls the curtain back, 
           revealing the BROKEN WINDOW, jagged pieces of glass. STORM 
           Dumping water. They pick/pull the last shards of glass out. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think we should wait.

                                 EVA
                        I can do it. I can get the police. 

           EXT. TOWN - MORNING

           Court, on foot, tunes in the sights and sounds of--

                              - ZAGREB, CROATIA -

           EXT. CITY SQUARE - ZAGREB - MORNING

           RUSSIAN GROM UNIT spreads out. FLOWER DELIVERY VAN pulls up.

                                 REIGEL (FILTERED O.S.)
                        Do not fuck around; do it as soon 
                        as the van door closes.

           EXT. STREETS OF ZAGREB - MORNING

           Court on his SAT PHONE-- 

                                 COURT
                        -- everything still on?

                                 FITZROY (O.S.)
                        Last sunrise for the both of us. 

                                 COURT
                        I need to speak with the girls. 

                                 FITZROY (O.S.)
                        Why? 

                                 COURT
                        Nothing easy about suicide. I want 
                        to know what I’m trading for. 

           INT. CHATEAU BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Eva climbs OUT THE WINDOW-- looking down, high above the 
           GROUNDS. Reaches for a drainpipe, loses her balance in the 
           wind. Barely catches herself in time. Heads back INSIDE--
                                 EVA
                        Maybe you’re right. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m not usually. I’ll go. 

           EXT. THE CHATEAU - THIRD STORY - CONTINUOUS

           Claire grabs the slippery pipe. Scared, but does it anyway.   
           Squeezing her legs around it, she slides down. Difficult, 
           since the back of the pipe is flush against the wall. 

           There’s five feet in between the METAL PLATES attaching the 
           pipe to the wall. So she slips down in stages, able to rest 
           for a moment at the bottom of each section.  

           GETS DOWN ONE SAFELY-- 

           Looks down. A long drop. Slips down the NEXT STAGE-- Still 
           twenty feet up. She shimmies down, the drainpipe is too 
           slick. Slips-- down-- almost falls-- just manages to squeeze 
           the pipe with her legs hard enough to slow herself. 

           ONE-- TWO more stages-- onto the courtyard. Looks up at Eva, 
           who waves. Claire squeezes through a FENCE-- and RUNS! 

           INT. HALLWAY - THIRD FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Archer, Reigel, and Fitzroy, Sat-Phone in hand stride towards 
           Eva and Claire’s GUARD. He pulls his mask on. Opens the door--

                                 FITZROY
                        Eva, face the wall, please-- 

           FITZROY sees Eva trying to keep the billowing Curtain down. 
           REIGEL, thinking two-steps ahead, snatches Fitzroy’s phone, 
           hangs up before he can utter a word of warning to-- 

           EXT. STREETS OF ZAGREB - MORNING

           -- Court, hearing a dial tone. Calls back as-- 

           EXT. APPLE ORCHARD - OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU - DAWN

           -- CAMERA SWEEPS OVER THE ORCHARD-- trees whip in the wind. 
           Fat raindrops-- FLYING TOWARDS THE CHATEAU-- 

                                 MALE VOICE/SNIPER (O.S.)
                        Command, this is Nest.

           going-- RISING UP--- up, up to--
           THE NEST - ROOFTOP BALCONY AT THE CHATEAU-- 

           -- slowing on A SNIPER RIFLE BARREL-- SCOPE REFLECTS the 
           image of Claire’s back-- running. In his crosshairs. 

                                 SNIPER
                        Target sighted. 

           PULL FOCUS-- see the snipers eye. Hears orders on his EARBUD--

                                 ARCHER (O.S.)
                        Safe your weapon. We’re coming out!

           INT. CHATEAU MAIN FLOOR - DAWN

           Reigel grabs an ASSAULT RIFLE, Fitzroy sees it, doesn’t react 
           fast enough. Reigel whips the BUTT ACROSS Fitzroy’s face. 
           Cracking teeth. Goes down in a bloody heap.  

           EXT. CHATEAU GROUNDS - DAWN

           Reigel, Archer and TWO GUARDS spot Claire, a hundred yards 
           away, a blur in the rain. Running fast as her little legs can 
           churn towards the APPLE ORCHARD. They follow. 

           INT. MIRANDA’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           ANOTHER GUARD pops the door open-- throws Eva inside.

                                 ANOTHER GUARD 
                        The other got away-- 

           Miranda spins towards her window, as we CUT TO--

           EXT. CLOSER TO TOWN CENTER - DAWN

           -- Court still listening to the PHONE-- RINGING. No one’s 
           picking up. Growing uneasy. His watch reads: 7:54 AM. 

           INT. TECH HUB - DAWN

           Tech hears the RINGING SAT PHONE-- doesn’t know what to do. 

           Fitzroy (face like ground beef) shackled to a chair, still 
           trying to get free. Desperation-strength. Wooden armwrests 
           start cracking. Guard has to knock him out as--

           EXT. EDGE OF THE APPLE ORCHARD - DAWN

           -- Claire, terror on her face, makes it to the gnarled trees. 
           Keeps going; now it seems even scarier. Being hunted in a 
           horror movie. Rolls her ankle. Doesn’t make a peep as-- 

           REIGEL: motions for his team to spread out--  
           ARCHER: sees Claire, fifty feet in front of him-- 

           CLAIRE: looks behind her, keeps running-- 

           ARCHER: charging, hurdling branches and brambles--

           REIGEL: hears something. Spots Claire. Rifle comes up--

           CLAIRE: makes a sharp cut, crossing over a row-- 

           ARCHER: sees Claire bolt from the trees in front of him--

           REIGEL: tracking with his rifle. Dead-eyes Claire as-- 

           INT. MIRANDA’S BEDROOM - DAWN 

           -- BRAAP! As the burst echoes off the stone, we see Miranda 
           open her mouth to scream and--

           EXT. A BLOCK FROM THE TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           -- Pigeons flap past Court. Watch reads: 7:57.

           INT. MIRANDA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Miranda, a mother’s agony, stares out. Eva, for the very 
           first time, starts bawling with guilt--

                                 EVA
                        It’s my fault--

           INT. CHATEAU TECH HUB - CONTINUOUS

           Fitzroy screams through busted teeth at Guard and Tech-- 

                                 FITZROY
                        You sign up to murder children? 
                        That your dream when you took a job 
                        here you fuckin’ monsters!? 

           Guard takes Fitzroy’s tie. GAGS him. 

           EXT. APPLE ORCHARD - DAWN

           LOW ANGLE-- on Reigel striding through the grass-- towards-- 

           BOOTS-- looking down on ARCHER. Burbling blood. Still 
           breathing. FOUR BULLETS stitched across his heart. Must’ve 
           dived in front of Claire to save her.  

           CLAIRE is staring at him. Frozen. Reigel, back to her, looks 
           down at Archer. Gun to his head. He speaks sweetly to Claire--
                                 REIGEL
                        Close you eyes, Schatz.

           She does. BRAAP! Finishes Archer off. Then, as if he just 
           mashed a bug, turns to face Claire. She opens her eyes. Looks 
           at Reigel’s gun, then up-- to his face: game changer. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Good thing you stopped running. 

           CLOSE ON CLAIRE’S ARM-- the HAIRS suddenly rise straight up.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’re the bad man.

                                 REIGEL
                        It’s only simple when you’re young.
                             (looks at the corpse)
                        How’s it feel to be responsible for 
                        your first kill? 

           She looks at him. Keeping it together. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You did it. 

                                 REIGEL
                        I didn’t mean to shoot him. Not 
                        yet, anyway. I was about to let you 
                        go. Now, a lot of people will have 
                        to die because of what you did. 
                             (her lips quiver)
                        If you fight me, I’ll hurt you. 

           She lets him pick her up. But doesn’t hold on to him. Goes 
           limp like a rag doll. Makes him work. Reigel actually smiles. 

           EXT. MIRANDA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Miranda holding Eva, can’t tear her eyes away from the 
           grounds. Guards appear from the rain. Then Reigel. Carrying 
           Claire like a rag-doll. Miranda almost loses it. But as 
           Reigel passes her off to a GUARD, Miranda sees she’s okay. 
           Then sees Reigel, unmasked. Miranda reacts; punch to the gut. 

                                 EVA
                        That’s the man we’re not supposed 
                        to see?

           EXT. NEAR THE PARK SQUARE - MORNING

           Court enters the back door of a bakery. Finally hangs up. A 
           desperate way about him. Eyes on the CLOCK TOWER. 
           Then, he looks at the FLOWER VAN where GROM LEADER casually 
           chats with a LOCAL. Blends right in. 

           INT. TECH HUB - DAWN

           Reigel hurries in-- hands Claire to Guard. Looks at a 
           massively relieved Fitzroy. Tempered quickly when Fitzroy 
           sees she’s staring at Reigel’s face. 

                                 TECH
                        Two to eight; he’s been calling.  

           Tech hands Reigel a HALLIBURTON CASE as he races upstairs--

           INT. CHATEAU BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Guards shackle Miranda’s hands behind the chair. A hateful, 
           mess as she stares at MAN IN A MASK (we can tell it’s Reigel 
           by the eyes). He slams HEADPHONES over her ears. 

           ON THE HEADPHONES-- we hear what she hears. REIGEL’S VOICE IS 
           LOUD, DISTORTED, SCARY-- 

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        Noise cancellation headphones-- 

                                 MIRANDA 
                        Where’s my daughter? 

           Guard opens a door. Claire is staring at her. Door is slammed 
           shut before Miranda can say anything. Reigel speaks fast--

                                 REIGEL
                        -- only thirty seconds left to get 
                        out of this. You were taken as a 
                        bargaining chip to capture one man; 
                        he’s agreed to trade for you, but 
                        insists on speaking to the girls 
                        first. If they tell him anything, 
                        you die. Understood?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Quite an incentive to cooperate; 
                        why the headphones and ticking 
                        clock, then?

                                 REIGEL
                        Twenty. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Why not just put my father and the 
                        girls on the phone?
                                 REIGEL
                        Fifteen--

           That’s it. Reigel GAGS Miranda. Grabs Eva. Takes her into--

           THE ROOM NEXT DOOR-- Reigel in his mask, addresses Claire-- 

                                 REIGEL 
                        A man is going to ask if you’ve 
                        seen my face. Tell him the truth, 
                        I’ll shoot your grandfather.

           Holds the phone out, as Claire reaches, he pulls it back. 

                                 REIGEL
                        If you want to save your family, 
                        you must make him believe. 

           Claire’s shaking. Gone through too much. Eva takes over. 

           INT. A STAIRWELL - MORNING

           COURT answers the VIBRATING PHONE. Wary. Doesn’t say a word--

                                 EVA (O.S.)
                        Can I speak to Granddad’s friend?

                                 COURT
                        This is Grandad’s friend.

           First time he’s ever spoken to his daughter. Should be 
           heaven. Instead, it’s a clutter of emotions. Eva is scared. 

                                 EVA (O.S.)
                        My name’s Eva. My sister Claire is 
                        right here, too. Say hello, Claire.

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Hello. 

                                 COURT 
                        Are you and your sister okay?

           BACK IN THE ROOM 

           Eva is doing everything to keep her voice from shaking--

                                 EVA
                        Yes. Mom’s okay too. Grandad’s not. 
                        He said he fell, but it’s not true.

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        Did you see the faces of the people 
                        that captured you?
                                 EVA
                        No. We wore masks and earmuffs.

           IN THE ROOM NEXT DOOR

           Miranda, gagged, cuffed to her chair, has her head down. 
           Suddenly leaps to her FEET. Knees up, on to the table. 
           Awkward, banging shins, chair’s still shackled to her back. 

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        What about your mother?

           The Guard grabs at her-- arms still trapped, she gets her 
           feet under her, jumps up and out OFF THE TABLE. Nothing 
           acrobatic, anyone could do it to save their kids-- 

                                 EVA (O.S.)
                        She hasn’t seen anything. 

           Landing, the CHAIR COLLAPSES. Ouch! Doesn’t matter, Miranda’s 
           able to whip her cuffed hands up. All to get her gag off and 
           scream at the top of her fucking lungs--

                                 MIRANDA
                        COURT, THEY’RE LOOKING AT HIS FACE! 

           ON COURT-- hears it. If he was angry before, it gets worse-- 

                                 MIRANDA (O.S.)
                        -- DON’T YOU DARE TRADE!

           Phone goes dead.

           REIGEL-- steps back in front of Miranda. Slams the door, 
           closing the girls off from him. Eerily calm. 

                                 REIGEL
                        You know who he is? 
                             (Miranda nods)
                        Congratulations. You all get to 
                        die. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        I’m not about to play Sophie’s 
                        Choice with you, motherfucker. 
                        Take your mask off. 

           Reigel complies with aplomb. Face-to-face with Miranda-- 

                                 MIRANDA
                        My girls only have one chance at 
                        survival. Tell Court where we are, 
                        then try to kill him on the way.
                                 REIGEL
                        You really think he can rescue you?

                                 MIRANDA
                        If you thought he was good before; 
                        wait ‘til you see what he’ll do to 
                        save his daughters. 

           She makes sure it lands on Reigel. Holding his gaze until 
           belief penetrates his mind. She nods; that’s right, asshole.  

           EXT. ROOFTOP - EIGHT STORY BUILDING - MORNING

           TOWER BONGS. SPOTTER eyes the square. Bongs finish. He senses 
           something in the silence. Turns as-- COURT shoots him in the 
           head. Breathing hard, not from exertion. Animalistic. 

           He strips SPOTTER’S PDA, gets a look at-- 

           -- MAP OF DOWNTOWN, with DOTS ON IT. Marking TEN TEAMMATES 
           nearby. Suddenly, the DOT where he’s standing starts BLINKING 
           ‘EKG failure. Probable Casualty.’ Looks at the SPOTTERS 
           WATCH. Blinking the same thing, then an embedded KILL SIGNAL 
           ZAPS the PDA screen to black. Court’s angry at his error--

                                 COURT
                        Stupid. Focus--

           Looks over the edge-- sees MEN IN THE SQUARE hurrying towards 
           his building. Court spins. Eyes a window washing basket, with 
           A SPOOL OF METAL CABLE. Lifts the corpse. Testing its weight.

           EXT. BAKERY - MORNING

           Same place Court was earlier-- Grom hurry in right as 
           SPOTTER’S CORPSE SMASHES DOWN OUT FRONT. Just long enough to 
           see a CABLE ATTACHED before it gets yanked back up-- WE RISE 
           UP FASTER-- to the roof-- see the WINDOW WASHING SPOOL 
           spinning-- WE RACE ACROSS THE BUILDING-- ANGLE DOWN ON--

           -- COURT, a controlled descent. Heavier than the CORPSE 
           (using it like an elevator counterweight). Three stories from 
           the ground. Sees POLICE RIP PAST a street. SIRENS BLARING.  

           LOOKING AT A VAN-- A MAN climbs in, Court kicks off the wall 
           above it, spools down, lands on the back roof, soft as a 
           spider. Soon as he releases the ROPE, it ZIPS UP AGAIN.

           EXT. HALLWAY - MORNING

           Reigel marches downstairs-- SIX GUARDS assembled below--
                                 REIGEL
                        No one leaves any of the Fitzroys 
                        alone. Not to cry. Not to piss. 

           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY - MORNING

           Reigel smacks Fitzroy’s mangled face to rouse him. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Morning, handsome. We found the 
                        Gray Man’s Achilles Heel. Normally, 
                        that would be bad news for you, but 
                        your daughter gave me a reason to 
                        keep everyone alive.  

           Miranda, stands by the stairs with Claire and Eva. No masks. 

                                 REIGEL
                        If you knew, you’d have told him to 
                        come in right away, so this may 
                        come as a bit of a shock.

           Reigel WHISPERS the truth in Fitzroy’s ear. Fitzroy smirks. 
           Bullshit. SHOCKED when Miranda’s face confirms it.

           INT. TROLLEY CAR - ABOVE GROUND - MORNING

           Court wills the SAT PHONE to ring. Finally does. He answers. 

           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY TECH HUB - MORNING

           Everyone listens as Reigel talks to Court on SPEAKERPHONE-- 

                                 REIGEL
                        Mr. Gentry, there is no longer any 
                        chance for a deal. You’ll have to 
                        come rescue them yourself.

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        Fine, tell me where you’re at.

                                 REIGEL
                        When you’re in shooting distance of 
                        Bayeux, Normandy, call, and I’ll be 
                        more specific. If you’re not here 
                        by eight PM Sunday, your family, 
                        for lack of a better word, will be 
                        disposed of. Anyone else shows, or 
                        we receive any inquiries, it will 
                        be open season on British children. 
                        If you tell a soul, I promise, we 
                        will know about it. Questions?
                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        None you would answer.

                                 REIGEL
                        Then game on. 

           EXT. STREETS OF ZAGREB - MORNING

           Court sets a COUNTDOWN TIMER on his watch: 58 hours left. 

           Walking among factories in an industrial part of town. Pulls 
           out the ENVELOPE MAURICE GAVE HIM. Opens it. Cash inside, a 
           SINGLE PAGE that looks like it’s been torn from a phonebook. 

           EXT. ZAGREB TOWN SQUARE - MORNING

           The KOREAN is charming the pants off FEMALE BAKER. She’s 
           laughing. BEHIND HER-- POLICE are dealing with the SPOTTERS 
           CORPSE, still attached to the ROPE. Korean eyes SURVEILLANCE 
           CAMERAS in the bakery. POLICE CALL Female Baker out-- 

           DOWNSTAIRS-- Korean finds the SECURITY SYSTEM, and we CUT TO--

           INT. A CAFE - SLOVENIA - MORNING

           -- Maurice having breakfast with his CARETAKER. On the phone--

                                 MAURICE
                        -- wish I could say I was happy to 
                        hear from you.  

           ON COURT - holding the PHONE BOOK PAGE out in front of him. 

                                 COURT
                        They’re in Normandy. I need an 
                        arsenal, Maurice. 

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 MAURICE (O.S.)
                        Papers first, kid. Can’t save 
                        anyone from an E.U. jail cell. 

           Court doesn’t want to bother, but knows Maurice is right. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Six, ten, and twelve down are names 
                        and addresses of a couple off-the-
                        grid forgers. 

           Court eyes the PROPER NUMBERS. Committing them to memory.
                                 MAURICE (O.S.)
                        Once you get that squared away, Nik 
                        Goerg gives you coordinates for my 
                        get-the-fuck-outta-dodge cache 
                        inside the E.U. At the shack door, 
                        take three steps South, and dig. 

           MAURICE-- stands. Walks away. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Twenty gets you in touch with a 
                        doctor anywhere in Europe. The 
                        shady kind. Got a feeling you’re 
                        gonna need one if you survive. 
                             (kind, but dead-serious)
                        If this didn’t happen, my life was 
                        the best version of your future. 
                        Some sad shit. So. You got a shot 
                        at not ending up like me, you take 
                        it. End of sermon. 

           EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING

           Court buys a MOTORCYCLE and gear from a WORKER. Nothing 
           flashy, an old bike with a good engine. Roars off-- 

           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY - MORNING

           Tech, and Reigel all examine a map. A general route from 
           Zagreb to Normandy plotted on it. 

                                 REIGEL
                        He’ll need help. I want Gentry’s 
                        background scoured. Who would he 
                        keep as an ace? Who would he turn 
                        to when he can’t trust a soul?

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           THE KOREAN studies Court on the footage of the bakery. 
           Rewinds. ZOOMING IN ON: Court’s fearful face as the Sat-Phone 
           rings-- doesn’t look like the world’s best killer. 

                                 KOREAN
                        Tired. Rattled. Scared. 

           EXT. ESTABLISHING - EVENING

           Sun still high in the sky, storm clouds on the horizon, 
           looking down on a river splitting the city of--

                           - LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA -   
           EXT. FRONT OF AN ALLEY - NIGHT

           Court eyes a five foot tall door. Metal. Hard to spot, 
           covered in HANDBILLS. TWO SOMALI MEN exit. Court crosses the 
           RAIN-SOAKED street. His hands hunt around for an intercom.

                                 COURT
                        Mr. Szabo. I need help. I can pay. 

                                 SZABO (INTERCOM O.S.)
                             (thick Hungarian accent)
                        You have references?

                                 COURT
                        Maurice Patton.

           INT. A LONG RATTY HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Dark. Filthy. Court heads towards a light.

           INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Part science lab, part library, part photo studio. LASZLO 
           SZABO sits at a desk, eyeing Court as he enters. Eastern 
           Block sixty (eighty in the face, forty in the physique).  

                                 SZABO
                        American, thirty-five. You don’t 
                        carry yourself like a soldier or 
                        cop. This is a good start--

                                 COURT
                        -- I’m just a guy who needs what 
                        you’re selling. Quickly.

           Szabo stands, reaches for a cane. Limps towards him. Reaches 
           for Court’s face, turns it left, then right. 

                                 SZABO
                        What am I selling?

                                 COURT
                        A passport. Clean, not fake. 

                                 SZABO
                        How is Gayle?

                                 COURT
                        Who?

                                 SZABO
                        Maurice’s wife, or course.
                                 COURT
                        He never married. I know you need 
                        to establish my bona fides, but I’m 
                        in a rush. Nothing Belgian.

                                 SZABO
                        An informed customer. You’ll pass 
                        for a Kiwi. Five thousand Euros.

           Court pulls the money out, shows it. Doesn’t hand it over. 

                                 SZABO
                        Now, about your appearance.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Court cuts his hair over the toilet. Shaves. Quick and 
           precise. Still careful to make sure not to leave any hair. 
           Looks at himself in the mirror. Bags under his eyes. Decent 
           haircut. With the beard gone, skin on his face is much whiter 
           than his body. He grabs a bottle of tanner. 

           BACK IN THE WORKSHOP

           Court looks pretty good. Ill fitting COAT, SHIRT and TIE. 
           Kept his own pants on, since it won’t show for the photo.

                                 SZABO
                        Quite the metamorphosis. Sit.

           Court takes a seat on the stool, facing a CAMERA on a tripod. 

                                 COURT
                        I need you to alter the photo.

                                 SZABO
                        For two thousand more, nothing will 
                        flag, but you’ll still look similar 
                        enough to pass a visual inspection. 
                             (Court nods)
                        Now. We need a good Kiwi name. 
                             (snapping photos)
                        Do you think Gray Man would work?

           Court rockets to his feet as the floor drops out below him. 
           And he’s FALLING INTO BLACKNESS. SMASHING his head as on the 
           side, hard, then again when he crashes down. KNOCKED OUT. 

           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Tech spins to Reigel--

                                 TECH
                        Got a forger on the line.
                                 SZABO (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
                        You have let it be known you are 
                        willing to pay for the man in the 
                        picture you sent. I have him. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Let me talk to him. 

                                 SZABO (O.S.)
                        That won’t be possible. He’s twelve 
                        feet below me, sealed up nice and 
                        tight. I’d rather not ruin it and 
                        get myself killed. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Care to calculate the odds of me 
                        paying without proof?

                                 SZABO (O.S.)
                        Give me a minute. 

                                 TECH
                        Call originated in Ljubljana. He’s 
                        got misdirection software on it, 
                        but I’ll cross reference it with a 
                        list of forgers and lock it down.  

                                 REIGEL
                        Who’s closest?

           Tech pulls up the screens, showing the strike teams-- 

                                 TECH
                        Lebanese. At an airport near Graz. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Put them in a helicopter. We need 
                        them to land close. 

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Szabo holds his SMARTPHONE up to the PHOTOS he took of Court--

           INT. BRICK LINED CISTERN - NIGHT

           Court comes-to as FOOTSTEPS creak closer. Opens his eyes. Low 
           light, from the PLEXIGLAS DOOR, twelve feet above him. Half 
           his body on top of something soft and wet. A soggy MATTRESS. 
           He looks at his WATCH. LUMINOUS. Got about 49 hours left.

           ON SZABO-- peeking his head over-- shines a LIGHT DOWN, 
           holding his CAMERA PHONE, spotlighting COURT. YELLING down--
                                 SZABO
                        I presume you are an armed beast? 
                        Think twice before discharging your 
                        weapon. Two inches of hardened 
                        plexiglas means you will be dodging 
                        your own bullets. 

           ON COURT-- HEARS Szabo CREAK away. Court fingers the slick 
           brick all around, covered with mold and mildew. Seven feet 
           across. Circular. No way to climb up. Lifts the mattress--

           -- underneath, he feels a THICK PIPE, source of the leaking 
           water. Pulls a LEATHER STRAP from his neck, strips it to 
           reveal a KEVLAR WIRE SAW. Then starts SAWING INTO THE PIPE. 

           INT. CHATEAU - NIGHT

           Reigel watches FOOTAGE OF COURT IN THE CISTERN. A thin smile-- 
           eyes the PHOTO SZABO SENT. Same clothes. Definitely Court.

                                 REIGEL
                        Sorry Court, no documents for you. 

                                 TECH
                        Got three possibilities. 

                                 REIGEL
                        Cistern would be in a basement--  

           Tech nods, gets to work adding in that piece of intel. Tech 
           locks down a location on a MAP--

                                 TECH
                        Only one address on a ground floor.  

           INT. CISTERN - NIGHT

           Court has his PISTOL on his lap, SPARE MAGAZINES next to it. 
           Boots off. Using his LEATHERMAN to pull BULLETS apart. Pops 
           the cap, taps GUNPOWDER out into his WATERPROOF BOOT.

           INT. SZABO’S OFFICE - DAY

           Szabo’s at his desk, looking at the EMAIL Reigel sent of 
           Court. ‘Francois Jenet’ passport photo. It says ‘REWARD’--

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        How much do you want? 

                                 SZABO
                        Half a million, wired now. Half 
                        when you have him. I’m not opening 
                        that hatch, and I’m not hanging 
                        around for your goon squad. 
                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        You cannot leave him unattended. 

                                 SZABO
                        Had quite a few captives in there. 
                        None have ever come close to 
                        escaping. But if you expect me to 
                        wait for a battle to start, there 
                        are other parties willing to pay. 

           INT. TECH HUB - CHATEAU - NIGHT

           Reigel and Tech exchange a look--

                                 REIGEL
                        You’ve been contacted by the CIA? 
                             (Szabo doesn’t answer)
                        Give me the account numbers.

           INT. CISTERN  - NIGHT

           Court, has FIFTEEN BULLETS emptied of GUNPOWDER. Hears Szabo 
           CREAK OVER AGAIN-- shifts his body to cover his work. Szabo’s 
           head appears, looking down on him. 

                                 COURT
                        You know there’s no way they’ll let 
                        you live, don’t you? 

                                 SZABO
                        I’m not planning on giving you to 
                        them. Just taking their down 
                        payment. Once your photo got out, 
                        CIA let it be known they’d pay 
                        quite a bit more. I’ve had fair 
                        relations with them in the past. 

                                 COURT
                        Tell me you didn’t call them. 

                                 SZABO
                        Station Chief here is ordering up 
                        some heavies from Vienna to take 
                        you into custody. I told him your 
                        reputation was overrated. Old frail 
                        Laszlo captured you all by himself. 

                                 COURT
                        They’ll send a wet team. CIA has a 
                        shoot-on-sight directive against 
                        me. They don’t leave witnesses.
                                 SZABO
                        I’m not planning on hanging around 
                        for them, either. Half from each 
                        party is a fortune for Lazlo. 

           EXT. BUDAPEST FIELD - NIGHT

           HELICOPTER lands. The SIX LEBANESE, all wearing backpacks, 
           carrying HEAVY BAGS leap out. A VAN pulls up.

           INT. CISTERN - NIGHT

           Court’s got THIRTY BULLETS emptied out. Now he disassembles 
           one of the MAGAZINES, pulls the spring out, pours all the 
           gunpowder from his boot into the magazine. Packs it tight.

           INT. SZABO’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Szabo’s packing everything he cares about. On the phone--

                                 SZABO
                        (The next flight. One way.) 

           Szabo checks his computer. On the screen-- we see he’s got an 
           ACCOUNT OPEN-- no money in it right now. Waiting. 

           INT. CISTERN - NIGHT

           Court fills his DRY SOCK with all the empty bullet 
           cartridges, crams the power filled magazine in, lashes the 
           whole thing together with his boot lace. 

           Feverishly rips several lengths of fabric from the mattress, 
           ties them together to make a strand about fifteen feet long. 

           EXT. IN FRONT OF SZABO’S DOOR - NIGHT

           The VAN pulls up. Lebanese leap out. 

           INT. CISTERN - NIGHT

           Court PUTS HIS ONE REMAINING BULLET IN THE GUN, lashes the 
           gun to his SOCK GRENADE CONTRAPTION, barrel is aimed into it. 
           Ties his ten foot strand of mattress material to the TRIGGER.

           Takes his PANTS OFF, ties the legs at the ankles. Hears Szabo 
           CREAK OVER-- then a MUFFLED EXPLOSION and a SQUEAL--

           INT. SZABO’S OFFICE - DAY

           -- Szabo sees FOUR LEBANESE rush into the office, guns up. 
           Szabo throws a RUG OVER THE PLEXIGLAS, hiding his prize.
                                 SZABO
                        Where is my money!?

           ON COURT-- In darkness now, fumbles around under the 
           mattress, yanks rotted foam from it, stuffs it in his ears, 
           then pulls the mattress to the side, kicks the THICK PIPE. 
           Breaks right at the section he was sawing earlier-- 

           -- WATER sprays, pumping FAST. Filling the cistern. Court 
           stands in underwear, no pants, boots on his feet, sans 
           shoelaces. Looks ridiculous, whatever it takes to survive. He 
           whips his pants above his head filling them with AIR. 

           Ties them off at the crotch, makes them a FLOATATION DEVICE. 
           Uses his other shoelace to tie the Sock Grenade to the top of 
           the pants. Making sure to keep it dry-- water rising enough 
           to float now, Court swims beside the pants and the mattress. 

           ON SZABO-- Guns aimed at his head, he’s on the phone--

                                 SZABO
                        You give me the money first! 

                                 LEBANESE LEADER
                        Give us the Gray Man. 

           Leader nods to his men. They start tearing the place apart-- 

           IN THE CISTERN

           Only a two feet of air left, Court’s hyperventilating. He 
           positions the SOCK GRENADE right at one of the hinges of the 
           Plexiglas. Dives down under the mattress, holding the piece 
           of string he attached to the gun trigger. 

           AT THE BOTTOM-- looks back up-- about to pull the trigger, 
           when LIGHT FLOODS IN-- able to see the PANTS BOMB has floated 
           away from the HINGE as we SMASHCUT TO-- 

           THE OFFICE - SAME MOMENT

           -- LEBANESE #2 looking down on the plexiglas door. FULL OF 
           WATER, can’t see more than a few feet down. Eyes the odd sock-
           pants-gun contraption floating. Cord runs over the mattress. 

           IN THE CISTERN

           Still holding his breath. Looking up, just deep enough where 
           he can’t be seen. Lungs bursting. Waiting for LEBANESE #2 to 
           look away. The moment he does, Court swims up. Shifts the 
           Sock-Pants contraption under the hinge, inches of air left. 

           Gets a breath, the sock-bomb is about to get soaked. No time. 
           Moves the mattress to wedge it in the right spot-- 
           ON LEBANESE #2

           Looking back-- thinks he sees a SHADOW-- as SMASH! The front 
           door crashes open-- CIA BREACHING TEAM enters. LEBANESE 
           ENGAGE. LEBANESE #2 drops on the plexiglas, FIRING OUT!

           ON COURT

           grabbing the pipe at the bottom as he yanks the cord. It 
           pulls the trigger on the gun-- CONTRAPTION EXPLODES with a 
           MUFFLED BOOM! Ripping the plexiglas up at four hundred mph-- 
           Lifting LEBANESE #2, his body crunches against the roof! 

           ON COURT

           pushing off the bottom with all his might-- no idea what’s 
           waiting for him above, as he crawls out-- INTO A FIREFIGHT!

           CIA HIT TEAM BLASTING away-- SHOOTING THE LEBANESE! Court 
           doesn’t hang around for this-- in his underpants, no shoes, 
           he rolls to his feet, slipping on the linoleum, and dives 
           down the hallway. Regains his feet, hands on a doorjamb as it 
           shreds with bullets, slicing splinters into his hand.  

           IN THE BATHROOM 

           -- where he shaved, sees a HIGH WINDOW in the shower; about 
           to jump up to it, when he sees his BACKPACK, sitting where he 
           left it. Grabs it, throws it out, then slithers up and out, 
           but with no pants, pulling himself out--

           -- HE DRAGS THE STITCHES IN HIS THIGH-- shreds them open. 
           Bites back his impulse to scream as he squeezes out into--

           A SMALL COURTYARD

           Tests a door-- locked, so he uses the IRON BARS on windows to 
           climb up to the second floor balcony. Places the BACKPACK 
           against the window, smashes it with his arm. One. Two. Three 
           times before it shatters. Loud SNAPS of gunfire below-- 

           INSIDE A BEDROOM

           -- Court tries to avoid the shards of glass from the busted 
           window, but it’s dark, bare feet step on it, slicing them-- 

           Crab-walking, listening; lights out, no noise. Hobbles into a 
           BATHROOM, pulls SHARDS OF GLASS from his feet. Deep puncture 
           wounds. No pants, we see the BULLET WOUND. Reopened. Nasty. 

           Cinches a HANDTOWEL over the wound, listens. Shooting‘s died 
           down across. SIRENS in the distance. Gingerly walks into-- 
           THE LIVING ROOM-- where he sees OLD LADY sitting on a couch, 
           staring at him. He mimes pulling pants on. Wide-eyed, she 
           points down the hall. He finds a CLOSET OF MEN’S CLOTHES. 

           Coveralls-- huge on him. Steel toed work boots are too big. 
           Court pulls them on, grabs a bunch of SOCKS. Head’s out. 

           INT. CHATEAU - SUNSET

           Reigel oversee the Tech. 

                                 TECH
                        CIA got four, two Lebanese still in 
                        the game. Their Commander sounds 
                        like his men are out for blood. 

           Reigel looks at the screens. Searching for inspiration. 

                                 TECH
                        No contacts off Fitzroy’s list 
                        within four hundred kilometers.

           At an impasse. Reigel doesn’t like this one bit. 

           EXT. SZABO’S FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           POLICE are all over the place. The Korean spots a SLOVENIAN 
           DETECTIVE. As they shake, the Korean deftly hands him MONEY. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Slovenian Detective leads the Korean down a hallway-- 
           striding past TRAYS OF FOOD. The Korean snatches a BOTTLE OF 
           HOT SAUCE. From another tray, he takes a NEEDLE. The 
           Detective flashes a BADGE. The NURSE backs off.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Szabo’s opens his eyes to see the Korean with the SYRINGE in 
           the bottle of HOT SAUCE. Plunger back. Sucking up RED FLUID.  

                                 KOREAN
                        Who sent him to you?

                                 SZABO
                        I want my money. 

           He squirts a touch of the HOT SUACE in Szabo’s eye. Moves the 
           syringe towards Szabo’s arm. 

           INT. FITZROY’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Fitzroy, shackled to the bed. IV in his arm. Swelling is bad, 
           getting worse. His breathing sputters. Eases. He’s okay. 
           INT. CLAIRE AND EVA’S ROOM - EVENING

           Guard is inside the room with them now. Reading. Claire 
           watches him. Looks at Eva. When she’s sure the Guard can’t 
           see, she pulls out her prize. She stole ARCHER’S FERRARI RED 
           CELL PHONE. Eva’s eyes go wide. Speaking softly-- 

                                 EVA
                        Where’d you get it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I took it from the man they killed. 

                                 GUARD 
                        Either talk loud enough for me to  
                        hear, or shut up. 

           They stop talking. Only for a moment though. 

                                 EVA 
                        You heard what he said if anyone 
                        else shows up? 
                             (Claire nods)
                        What if we call Grandad’s friend?

                                 CLAIRE
                        We don’t have the number. 

                                 GUARD
                        Keep going, I’ll gag you up. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Talk about uncomfortable: Miranda, Tech, and Reigel sit close 
           to each other at a long table. Miranda has one hand cuffed to 
           the chair. The food looks great. Juicy FILET MIGNON. Rare.

                                 REIGEL
                        I’d like to know how it happened; 
                        star-crossed lovers and all that.

           Miranda stares at him; feeling out her next move--

                                 REIGEL
                        Your girls can make it home with 
                        PTSD that will have them pissing 
                        their beds for a few weeks, or they 
                        can suffer far more lasting 
                        indignities. He will still come if 
                        there’s only one of you left. 

           She chooses to speak breezily; to lessen Reigel’s power. 
                                 MIRANDA
                        I met Court ten years ago; I was on 
                        holiday with my parents when the 
                        Queen’s adversaries came calling. 
                        Court was nearby. Still in CIA, but 
                        he and my father had worked a 
                        difficult job together in 
                        Afghanistan. Dad called in a favor.

                                 REIGEL
                        You must have made quite an 
                        impression. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        When a man kills five men and takes 
                        a bullet to save your life, yes, it 
                        does make quite an impression. 

           Reigel chomps away. Enjoying himself. Waves her on.

                                 MIRANDA
                        I became pregnant, naively thought 
                        he’d leave it all behind. But my 
                        white knight wasn’t much of a man. 
                        Left without so much as a goodbye. 

                                 REIGEL
                        The Gray Man is a deadbeat. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        This morning was the first time 
                        I’ve heard his voice in eight 
                        years. If you’d told me who you 
                        were after, we’d all be home now.

                                 REIGEL
                        Rather ruthless, don’t you think? 
                        The man volunteered to turn himself 
                        in knowing it meant a bullet in his 
                        head. Must count for something?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Means he’s the right kind of 
                        monster. Unlike you.  

                                 REIGEL
                        Even bad men love their mothers. 

           EXT/INTERIOR - MONTAGE - DAY

           -Court rides the motorcycle past a SIGN. Subtitled 
           translation: ‘Villach, Austrian Border Checkpoint, 4 km’. He 
           pulls down a dirt road. Hops off the bike. Heads uphill on 
           foot. Towards Austria.
           -SOMEONE watches Maurice’s CARETAKER, cleaning his house.

           -COURT, on foot, limps across GREEN FARMLAND. In a redoubt, 
           he takes his boots off, bloody as fuck. Re-wraps them.  

           -MAURICE, in darkness, stumbles up a hill, drunk.

           -COURT sits in the backseat of a bus. Passing a sign that 
           reads ‘Montlingen, Switzerland’. Watch reads: 38 hours left.

           INT. MAURICE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Maurice, sleeping, COUGHS, reaches for his DRUGS-- pops them. 
           Downs his water. As he lights a smoke, the flash illuminates 
           THE KOREAN. Maurice reaches for his GUN. Lifts it.

                                 MAURICE
                        -- emptied the clip. And spiked my 
                        drugs. Sneaky little fucker. 
                             (smacks his lips)
                        What did we use here; Sodium 
                        Amytol? Yeah. Rookie; may as well 
                        give me a handjob while we chat. 

                                 THE KOREAN
                        I read your prescriptions. Creates 
                        a problem when the threat of death 
                        makes the subject happy. The drug 
                        clouds the mind.

                                 MAURICE
                        You have to get me talking first. 

                                 KOREAN
                        Look to your left. 

           Maurice looks over-- sees his Caretaker staring up at him. On 
           the floor. Gagged. Bound. Maurice closes his eyes. Hardens.

                                 MAURICE
                        You’ll kill her anyway.

                                 THE KOREAN
                        Yes. But quickly or slowly? It’s 
                        surprising how long a human being 
                        can survive without skin.   

           The Korean stands. Pulls her over to the bed. Draws a KNIFE. 

                                 THE KOREAN
                        We have all night. 

           ON MAURICE-- hears a MUFFLED CRY, and we CUT TO--
           EXT. CHATEAU GROUNDS - NIGHT

           -- ROAR OF A HELICOPTER, lifting off behind MR. FELIX (Isaac 
           Abubaker’s Intelligence Advisor). He shakes Reigel’s hand-- 

                                 REIGEL
                        Mr. Felix.

                                 MR. FELIX
                        Madame Laurent’s ace in the hole. 

           INT. CHATEAU LIBRARY - NIGHT

           They enter; Mr. Felix is flipping through PAGES, catching up. 
           Reading about ASSETS in play--

                                 MR. FELIX
                        He’s been even more resourceful 
                        than you expected-- 

           Mr. Felix gets to Court’s SAD DOSSIER. He starts flipping 
           through. Pulls out the DENTAL RECORDS. Holds them up. 

                                 MR. FELIX
                        Makes verification a breeze. 
                        Assuming you get him in time.

                        The Korean is checking in.

                        I’m sending you the location of 
                        Patton’s cache in Switzerland. 

                                 REIGEL
                        You’re certain he didn’t lie? 

                                 THE KOREAN (O.S.)
                        Only for the first half hour. 

           The Korean hangs up. Coordinates pop up on Tech’s screen. 

                                 MR. FELIX
                        Who is that guy?

                                 REIGEL
                        You heard about the job in Kiev? 

                                 MR. FELIX
                        I heard the Gray Man did it.
                             (beat)
                        It was the Korean? You’re sure?
                                 REIGEL
                        Of course; I hired him. 

                                 MR. FELIX
                        Why would he give you information 
                        that helps the others?

                                 REIGEL
                        He’s an entrepreneur; the Gray Man 
                        is his closest competitor.  

           EXT. SWISS VILLAGE - NIGHT

           COURT walks through a small village. Dark. Rubbing his black 
           rimmed eyes; one tired dude. Checks his watch. 34 hours. 
           Heads uphill, away from town, towards the woods.

           EXT. THE WOODS OF A VALLEY - NIGHT

           Court hurries along a path-- leading into a CLEARING in--

                        - NORTHEASTERN SWITZERLAND -

           He’s exhausted. GRASSHOPPERS. BIRDS chatter with each other 
           until he gets close. Then they grow quiet as we CUT TO--

           INT. THE CHATEAU TECH HUB - NIGHT

           MAP of the area shows one road only bisecting MOUNTAINOUS 
           SECTION. VALLEYS on either side, with a pair of TOWNS.   

                                 REIGEL
                        Have SSG move in on foot from here. 
                        Get everyone else in these two 
                        towns as soon as possible. 

           SCREEN ZOOMS IN on the MOUNTAINS, on the CABIN COORDINATES-- 
           a bowl shaped CLEARING with ROCK WALLS around.

                                 MR. FELIX
                        Six kilometers from the insertion 
                        point to the cabin; insert them 
                        here, you’ll cut the distance by--

           Reigel, points to the map, slams the door on him with relish--

                                 REIGEL
                        -- these walls act as a natural 
                        amphitheater. Drive too close, 
                        he’ll be able to hear the engine. 
                        Don’t worry. SSG can cover the 
                        distance in twenty minutes without 
                        so much as a snapped branch. 
           EXT. WIDE ON A TINY SHACK - NIGHT

           Court, using a TAC LIGHT, circles around a UTILITY SHED, 
           hidden in trees. Three steps from the front door, two right. 
           Digs. FINDS A COFFEE CAN-- inside is a baggie. With KEYS.

           AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE SHACK

           His fingers find a THIN TOOTHPICK. Satisfied no one’s been 
           here, he uses the keys to unlock a RUSTY PADLOCK--

           INSIDE

           Court lights a KEROSENE LAMP. Walls hold MRE’S and MEDICAL 
           SUPPLIES. Clean clothing. Tears his own clothes off. 

           Pulls off the BODY ARMOR he got from Iraq. Body is purple 
           with bruises-- especially his back. He uses a mirror to check 
           the wounds. INFECTED where the bullets punctured his skin. 
           Nothing he can do. Devours the MRE’s like a starving man.

           BEHIND HIM, hanging on hinged by to the door is a SEVEN FOOT 
           TALL MESH GRATE. Barely visible in the dim light.

           Turns his attention to the GUNSHOT WOUND in his thigh. 
           Infected as well. Injects himself with a ANTIBIOTICS. Starts 
           cleaning the wound again. Wincing. Hurts like hell. 

           Court, eyes fluttering, finishes bandaging his feet. Unrolls 
           a sleeping bag. Watch reads: 29 hours. Sets his watch alarm 
           for 7 AM. Puts his clothes, body armor on. BACKPACK beside 
           him. Kills the lamp, SOUNDS OF NATURE chirp nearby. 

           INT. VAN - PARKED - NIGHT

           FOUR PAKISTANI SSG (the Hawkish, lean Waziris from before) 
           load weapons. Prepping for an assault. Watches read: 4:30 AM. 

           Use RED TAC-LIGHTS to study A MAP. Speak in Pashtu--

                                 SSG LEADDER
                        (Two will set up here. Three here, 
                        four here. If he survives the 
                        explosion, we herd him towards 
                        these rocks. Our target is injured 
                        and exhausted; assume he’s not.) 

           EXT. IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

           SHAPES IN THE DARK-- even running flat out, they’re very 
           quiet-- NIGHT VISION POV-- watching the CABIN from afar.  
           EXT. WIDE ON THE CABIN - NIGHT

           SSG LEADER-- wearing NIGHT VISION GOGGLES, whispers in a MIC--

                                 LEADER
                        (One in position.)

                                 NUMBER #2 (O.S. FILTERED)
                        (Two on West side. One window.)

                                 NUMBER #3 (O.S. FILTERED)
                        (Three on East side.) 

                                 NUMBER #4 (O.S. FILTERED)
                        (Four on South. Near a shed. Fresh 
                        tracks; someone’s here.) 

           SSG LEADER POV-- hits a SWITCH ON HIS GOGGLES, they flick to 
           THERMALS: Court’s laying on the cabin floor.

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON COURT-- sleeping like the dead. Fully unaware.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR OF CABIN - NIGHT

           EITHER SIDE OF THE CABIN-- SSG take up covering positions. 
           Leader, soft-walking, heads towards the porch.

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Court’s still out. Only sound is his breathing since--

           RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR

           -- SSG LEADER is exceptionally quiet. Gets the BREACHING 
           CHARGE placed noiselessly. Moves back out. Silent as a ghost-- 

           INSIDE

           -- that’s the problem. The ABSENCE OF SOUND wakes Court. 
           Nature knows an interloper. May as well be an alarm.

           Court grabs two BAGS OF GEAR, drop into a TRAPDOOR. THE 
           BREACHING CHARGE EXPLODES. SHOCKWAVE RIPS IN! A FIREBALL-- 

           EXT. WIDE ON THE CABIN - MOMENT LATER

           -- Illuminates everything for fifty yards. Leader waves his 
           team back in. MOST OF THE FLOOR is still in place. No Court.

           Explosion shifted the floorboards, making the reinforced 
           trapdoor obvious. Leader starts firing down. Pulls EXPLOSIVE 
           from his belt. Stands back. BOOM! SHAPED CHARGE BLOWS DOWN! 
           INT. THE UTILITY SHED - CONTINUOUS

           Court opens the trapdoor, leaps up from the tunnel with an 
           explosion of dirt and air. A FOUR WHEELER ATV in front of 
           him. Leaps on. ENGINE SPUTTERS. 

           Doesn’t catch, but the headlights turn on. IN THE FLASH OF 
           LIGHTS, he sees the GRIP has been MODIFIED, flicks lights 
           off. Tries again-- as BULLETS DECIMATE THE THIN WOOD WALLS--  

           OUTSIDE THE SHED

           The ATV explodes through the door. SSG FIRE as we CUT TO-- 

           NIGHT VISION POV-- targeting the ATV, no lights. As it hauls-
           ass into trees, the GOGGLES get ripped off our head and we--

           REVERSE OF COURT-- a hand over SSG #2’s mouth, snaps his 
           neck. Takes his SKORPION MACHINE PISTOL. Runs UPHILL-- 

           ON A DIMLY LIT SHEEP PATH

           -- Court sprints. Wall of rock looming ahead. No choice. Has 
           to drop the DUFFEL BAG OF WEAPONS. Starts climbing. Fast. 
           Looking back and down- sees THREE SSG enter the clearing. 

           Court leaps for holds. Sees a GAP in the rock. Keeps climbing 
           to the top. BULLETS close in. No choice, has to drop. Falls 
           EIGHT FEET-- lands awkwardly, might’ve cracked a rib. 
           Squeezes through THE GAP he saw. Blocked from bullets. Grass 
           underfoot as it opens up. He limp-scramble-runs upwards.

           EXT. ROCK WALL - NIGHT

           The Pakistani SSG are no joke. Leaping like mountain goats 
           uphill, not taking the wall, but running around to an area 
           not quite as steep. Sprinting. Closing fast. 

           EXT. NEARBY FARM - NIGHT

           Court, crazy winded, running downhill, still got his 
           BACKPACK, looks back. Sees SHAPES over a rise near the cliff, 
           a hundred yards behind. Hurries towards a BARN-- CAR and a 
           BIKE. Easy choice. Hops on the bike. And with his stolen 
           NIGHT VISION GOGGLES, glides off, accelerating downhill. 

           INT. LIBRARY TECH HUB - PRE-DAWN

           They’re watching screens--

                        Then he’ll hit Urnasch for a car, 
                        or shift around it on foot.

                        Grom and five watchers in position.

           Tech brings up a CAMERA FEEDS from the WATCHERS--

           EXT. BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY - EDGE OF TOWN - PRE-DAWN

           -- Court biking towards a TOWN of five thousand. Behind him, 
           sees a VAN heading downhill-- lights out. He throws the bike 
           in the bushes, limp-runs towards town. Trying to think. What 
           happened. So tired. Then, an electric bolt as he realizes--

                                 COURT
                        -- I told Szabo his name. 

           Yanks his SAT PHONE out. Hits send. Last number he dialed. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        (This is the Piran Police.)

                                 COURT
                             (already knows)
                        Why are you answering this phone?

                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry. Mr. Patton was found de--

           -- Court hangs up. Guilt piles on. His error. His fault.  

           EXT. URNASCH STREET - DAWN

           TWO RUSSIAN GROM cross a bridge-- ZOOM IN ACROSS THE RIVER-- 
           TWO WATCHERS canvas the area--

           EXT. BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY - DAWN

           Pakistani SSG are on foot now-- LEADER kneels by the bike. 
           Waves his men to follow COURT’S TRACKS, hot on his heels.

           EXT. DOWN A SIDE STREET - DAWN

           DELIVERY VEHICLES, etc. Town is waking up for the day. 
           WATCHER in a CAR sees a SOMEONE limp towards an OLD CAR-- 

                                 WATCHER 4-2
                        This is Four-Two, I may have him--
           EXT. NEARBY - DAWN

           -- TWO MORE GROM sprint. Silently rounding a corner. GUNS UP, 
           aimed at the OLD CAR’S WINDSHIELD. If Court were inside, 
           they’d have him. Side window is SMASHED, but no Court. He’s-- 

           HURRYING AROUND A CORNER

           -- climbing a tree. Rolling over a WALL. Knows they’re close. 
           Spots TWO OPEN UMBRELLAS, drying out in a backyard. The sharp 
           tip on one stands out. Snatches the inconspicuous weapon.  

           EXT. FROM A ROOFTOP - DAWN

           Looking over the village-- we catch up to the Korean-- 
           leaping down the outside of the building.

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        This is a closed channel. Head to 
                        street level. He’ll ID the others 
                        and try to shake them.

           Drainpipes-- to fire escapes-- on the ground in seconds-- 

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        Shift North of the bridge--

                                 THE KOREAN
                        No. It’s a natural chokepoint, 
                        he’ll avoid it.  

           EXT. STREET - DAWN

           Court blends in with PEOPLE. Trying not to sweat. Holding the 
           UMBRELLA. Eyes pass over a Grom soldier a hundred yards away. 

           EXT. A NARROW ALLY - DAWN

           Court looks out at a street in front of the river. Looks up 
           the alley. Then towards the street. Sees a CABBIE smoking-- 

           -- from the shadows, he detects the slightest flash, body 
           tenses, reacting. Not fast enough to avoid a BLADE PLUNGING 
           INTO HIS BELLY-- just manages to grab KOREAN’S WRIST before 
           he’s disemboweled. But the slice penetrates his abdominal 
           MUSCLES, then across. Court, groaning, uses his free hand to 
           jam the TIP of the umbrella up towards the Korean’s face-- 

           Korean avoids it, but it’s just enough for Court to rip his 
           free hand across his body, grab his HANDGUN-- 

           Korean, knocks it away. Court prevents the blade from moving-- 
           Korean twists-- serrating ABDOMINAL MUSCLE. 
           Even fully clothed, the SOUND of the cut, and Court’s agony, 
           should guarantee it’s virtually impossible to watch-- if it 
           pierces any further, Court’s dead. Fighting like he knows it--

           Court, all he can do not to scream, has to bite down on his 
           lip ‘til blood comes out. Pushes with both legs, slams The 
           Korean into the wall while whipping his head forward-- 

           -- a skull cracking HEAD BUTT; the loudest noise of the 
           fight. Korean staggers, Court jabs the tip of his umbrella up 
           again. Court’s taller, the Korean has to go up on his toes to 
           prevent the tip from entering the lower part of jaw. Now it’s 
           an odd, disgusting face off. Court slowly punctures The 
           Korean’s lower jaw, tip entering his mouth. Blood pours. 
           Korean, free hand, twists the blade on Court’s hip--

                                 COURT
                        Ahhhhh--

           COURT FOCUSES, leaps, propelling the tip of the umbrella into 
           the Korean’s brain. Court’s passing out, can’t let it happen, 
           only seconds for a getaway. Takes the GUN, removes his tie, 
           pulls the BLADE out with an agonizing MOAN--

           -- shoves the tie into the wound. Nasty. Bleeding like crazy.  

           OUT IN THE STREET

           Court sees LADY on a bicycle. Holds a hand out to stop-- 

           INT. CHATEAU - DAWN

           -- Reigel is watching his teams move. Watching them run. SEES 
           A CAMERA PAN ACROSS THE KOREAN’S CORPSE-- massive amounts of 
           blood near his head. Slimmer trail leading down the street-- 

                                 WATCHER 6-1 (O.S.)
                        Command, this is six-one. I’m 
                        tracking the subject.

                        What’s he doing?

                        Attracting the police.

           EXT. BRIDGE - DAWN

           Court’s surrounded. TEN MEN run in on both sides of the 
           river. Grievously wounded, no choice but to fall off the 
           bike, then HOLD ON TO IT-- AS HE ROLLS OFF THE BRIDGE--

           -- INTO THE RIVER-- FOLLOWING HIM DOWN-- UNDERWATER-- uses  
           the bike to help him sink. DOWN. DOWN. ABOVE HIM--

           MUZZLE FLASHES glow like orange fireflies. Bullets punch the 
           water like silvery schools of fish. Peaceful now. Court 
           hovers near the bottom. May lose consciousness, then wills 
           himself back. Inserts his LEATHERMAN in the sidewall of a 
           tire. BREATHING IN THE AIR. Gets the other TIRE FREE. 

           Letting the current take him. Breathing from his TWO TIRES. 

           INT. CHATEAU - MORNING

           Reigel can’t believe Court got away. LIVE FEEDS SHOW: 
           everyone moving away as POLICE arrive. 

                                 MULTIPLE WATCHERS (O.S. FILTERED)
                        No eyes-- police arriving-- we need 
                        to clear out. 

                                 MR. FELIX
                        Video won’t do it. I need his body.

           EXT. RIVERBANK OF A PARK - EDGE OF TOWN - DAWN

           Court’s a hundred feet up an embankment, buried between a 
           tree and a wall, hidden in shadow. Breathing is shallow. 
           White skin, blue, trembling lips. He feels a VIBRATION. Looks 
           down. The RUGGED SAT-PHONE still works. Fingers fumble-- 

                                 EVA (O.S.)
                        Hello? 

           INT. CHATEAU BEDROOM - DAWN

           Reigel and TWO GUARDS hover over Eva. Phone is on SPEAKER, so 
           Claire can read the phone number. 
                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        Hello, Eva.

           Claire traces the number behind her, on the VELVET BEDSPREAD. 

                                 EVA 
                        How’d you know it was me?

           BACK ON COURT - holding his bloody wound.

                                 COURT 
                        You and Claire sound different.

                                 EVA (O.S.)
                        Are you still coming?

           Court gulps. Embers of life come back into his eyes-- 

                                 COURT
                        Yes, I’m still coming. 

                                 EVA (O.S.)
                             (a child’s intuition)
                        How come?

           Court sits there. Spent. Will he say it? A long beat. Then-- 

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        Figured you’d need an elixir; can’t 
                        have you running off and dying in a 
                        hole. You only have sixteen hours.

                                 COURT
                        I don’t-- but you do.

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        Considering the shape you’re in, I 
                        like my odds.

           Court hangs up. Feels in his coat pocket. Pulls out MAURICE’S 
           ENVELOPE-- pulls out the TELEPHONE BOOK PAGE, runs a finger 
           down the list. Stops on the twentieth number down.  

           EXT. STREET - MORNING

           Court staggers down a street. Finds a closed bolted door, so 
           he plops down behind a dumpster. Waits. 

           SIRENS wail in the distance. Court hears a noise. Sees a 
           PRETTY SWISS-FRENCH WOMAN (20’s) lean out the door. Looking 
           around. Court rises to his feet-- 

                                 WOMAN
                        Allez. 
           She waves at him, then sees how badly he’s injured, and runs 
           over, putting her arm around him. Carrying him inside. 

           INT. DARK ROOM - MORNING

           As they stagger in, Court is startled to hear the sound of 
           DOGS BARKING, close. Woman turns on a light.

                                 WOMAN 
                        Parlez vous Anglais?
                             (Court nods)
                        Monsieur, I tried to tell your 
                        contact that my boss was out of 
                        town; he’s on his way here now, but 
                        it will be a few hours. 

                                 COURT
                        No. You have medicine and bandages 
                        or he wouldn’t have sent me here. 

           Blood pools under Court, laying on a metal table. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Doctor LePage has access to a 
                        nearby clinic; I do not. You need a 
                        hospital. Mon Dieu, you are cold--

           She grabs a blanket, drapes it over his shoulders-- 

                                 COURT
                        What’s your name?

                                 WOMAN/JUSTINE
                        Justine. And you?

                                 COURT
                        How about Paul. 
                             (she looks at him, what?)
                        Justine, you’re a vet. That’s close 
                        enough. I just need some blood and-- 

                                 JUSTINE
                        -- a vet’s assistant. I give baths. 
                        I hold dogs down. You are about to 
                        die. 

                                 COURT
                        I can talk you through what needs 
                        to be done. I need a couple units 
                        of O-positive, some antibiotics, 
                        and your hands. 
           Court pulls his shirt up-- chest is white. Blood pressure is 
           so low, no blood comes out-- but this is the first look at 
           the wound; a tie wadded up inside. Justine can’t believe it. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        I cannot help you with that!

                                 COURT
                        Imagine me with fur.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        How do you joke while bleeding to 
                        death. 

                                 COURT
                        No idea. Where’s the clinic?

                                 JUSTINE
                        A bandage first; otherwise you will 
                        not make it. 

           Court does his best to get his clothes off-- she helps. Gets 
           a look at the most wrecked human body she’s ever seen--

                                 JUSTINE
                        What the hell happened to you?!

                                 COURT
                        Shot in the leg. Stitches keep 
                        tearing, so it’s infected. Same 
                        with the back. Hands got splinters, 
                        cracked my ribs falling down a 
                        hill, don’t even look at my feet.  

           She pulls rubber gloves on-- looks at his gut. Puts a PAD 
           over the wound, wraps a COMPRESSION BANDAGE AROUND-- tight. 

                                 COURT
                        We need to go right now.

                                 JUSTINE
                        To a hospital.

                                 COURT
                        The clinic. I need to get out of 
                        town. Have Dr. Lepage call over and 
                        cover for you. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Do you not understand how badly 
                        injured you are? A few centimeters 
                        deeper, you would be disembowled.
                                 COURT
                        I don’t have a choice. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        The choice is between living and 
                        dying, Paul.

                                 COURT
                        I get blood, I’ll be okay. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        I was just told to open this place--

           Court rummages in his jacket-- pulls out the envelope from 
           MAURICE-- hands it to her, all the money. Soggy. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        How much is this?

                                 COURT
                        A lot. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        I cannot. I don’t want to go to 
                        jail, or get wrapped up in-- 

                                 COURT
                        -- Justine. If I don’t get to 
                        Normandy by tonight, two little 
                        girls will be killed. I know it’s a 
                        shitty deal, but if you walk away 
                        now, they’re dead.  

           Court looks at her, emotional; Superman is begging. 

                                 COURT
                        Please. 

           INT. JUSTINE’S CAR - MORNING

           Court’s in the passenger seat of her 1981 LE CAR, a bona fide 
           tas de mierde. Smoke comes out as they drive.

                                 JUSTINE
                        If you can’t even drive, what do 
                        you expect to do when you get to 
                        their location?

                                 COURT
                        I can drive. Right now, we need to 
                        put distance between us. Police are 
                        locking everything down here. 
                             (off her look)
                        We’ll do a transfusion in the car-- 
           As Justine switches gears, they grind, nosily--

                                 COURT 
                        -- not this one. 

           Court finds a PENCIL, writes a list on SCRAP PAPER--

           EXT. IN FRONT OF THE CLINIC - MORNING

           Parked. Court hears POLICE HELICOPTERS circling the river; he 
           passes her the SCRAP PAPER, then the car’s TIRE IRON. 

                                 COURT
                        Last one on the list should be with 
                        the pediatric drugs. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Dextrostat?

           He nods. She steps to the window, looks at Court--

                                 JUSTINE
                        You better not be lying to me about 
                        your kids. 

                                 COURT
                        I didn’t say they were mine.

                                 JUSTINE
                        If they weren’t, you’d be dead 
                        already.

           INT. CAR - MINUTES LATER

           Justine pulls up in an SUV. Opens the door-- Court passed 
           out. Blinks. She helps him climbs in the driver’s seat-- 

                                 JUSTINE
                        If you pass out-- 

                                 COURT
                        -- I won’t.

           INT. SUV - MORNING

           Justine dumps everything on her lap as Court drives. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Three unit’s O-positive, two bags 
                        dextrose, transfusion equipment, 
                        Morphine, and a suture kit. 

                                 COURT
                        And?
                                 JUSTINE
                        Oh yes, the Dextrostat. I read the 
                        bottle. It is a very strong 
                        amphetamine. If the stitches are 
                        not perfect, even one pill will 
                        spike your blood pressure so much 
                        you will bleed to death quickly.

           Court nods. Tucks the DEXTROSTAT into his pants pocket.

                                 COURT
                        Police will have roadblocks set up.

                                 JUSTINE
                        We can cut through Manet’s farm.

           EXT. WIDE ON THE TOWN - MORNING

           POLICE CHECKPOINTS have been set up at all the roads-- 

           EXT. COUNTRY LANE - MORNING

           The SUV drives off a dirt road, onto pavement. Accelerates.

           INT. SUV - DRIVING  - MORNING

           Justine has set up the TRANSFUSION EQUIPMENT. Tubes snake 
           from the BLOOD BAGS hanging in back-- into Court’s arms. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        -- second bag is already empty. 

           She switches it to a THIRD bag of blood.

                                 JUSTINE 
                        This attack, it will be just you?

                                 COURT
                        Unless you’re handy with a gun. 

                                 JUSTINE 
                             (not amused)
                        You don’t even have one.

           INTERNET ACCESS is legal in European cars. Court’s able to 
           pull up info on: ‘HAMILTON and ASSOCIATES’ sees their world 
           headquarters is in Geneva, Switzerland. Sees the ADDRESS.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        Odds are not so good for you?

                                 COURT
                        Been lucky so far-- 
                                 JUSTINE
                        Lucky? Your body is trash.
                             (Court looks at her)
                        I mean wrecked, no?

           Court tries to smirk. Barely has it in him, as we CUT TO--

           INT. BACKSEAT - FEW MINUTES LATER

           -- BAGS OF DEXTROSE and ALL THREE BLOOD BAGS are empty. In 
           FRONT, Justine has everything laid out-- 

                                 JUSTINE
                        You look better. 

                                 COURT
                        Let’s get this over with.

           Threads the RAZOR SHARP HOOKED NEEDLE, dips it in antiseptic. 
           She takes scissors, cuts the BANDAGE OFF, dumps antiseptic. 
           Stings. He jumps. She just looks at him-- 

                                 JUSTINE
                        If that hurts, this will not work. 

                                 COURT
                        It was cold. 

           Gets a smile out of her. Unfastens her seat belt, then his. 
           She gets on her knees in the passenger seat. Uses TAPE to 
           attach a PENLIGHT to the underside of the steering column, 
           lighting her surgical station. 

                                 COURT
                        You’ll have to go deep into the 
                        muscle to close it. If you stitch 
                        the skin, it will tear. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Why didn’t you ask for a numbing 
                        agent? 

                                 COURT
                        Cut’s too deep. Whatever I say, do 
                        not stop. 

           Justine starts a half inch outside the wound. Courts okay 
           until she TUGS IT-- his eyes roll back in agony.

                                 JUSTINE
                        You start feeling clammy, nauseous, 
                        tell me. You cannot go into shock. 
                             (he nods)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUSTINE (cont'd)
                        Do you want to talk about anything, 
                        to distract you?

           Looking down at the HOOKED NEEDLE--

                                 COURT 
                        It’ll have to be pretty thrilling.

           For the rest of this scene, she shoves the needle in time 
           with the questions-- uses gauze to wipe away the blood as she 
           works. Wipe, antiseptic, then a stitch--

                                 JUSTINE
                        How old are they?

                                 COURT
                        Eight. I spoke to them for the 
                        first time yesterday.

                                 JUSTINE
                        Ah. You are one of those men. 
                             (Court doesn’t answer)
                        Their mother is with them now?
                             (Court nods)
                        She was a fling, then?

                                 COURT
                        No. I was crazy about her.
                             (Justine looks confused)
                        You can’t leave what I do behind.

                                 JUSTINE
                        Even for a family?

                                 COURT
                        They’d never be safe. Only part of 
                        it, though, if I’m honest.

           Talking to a stranger, sleep deprived, emotionally spent, 
           trying to keep his mind off agonizing pain, this is the only 
           scenario that would ever get Court to open up. 

                                 COURT
                        My dad trained SWAT teams on our 
                        ranch; wasn’t the kind of person 
                        you want raising kids. I realized a 
                        long time ago, I’m just like him. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Did you tell her that?
                             (he shakes his head)
                        So then, what, you kissed her one 
                        last time, and that was it? 
                                 COURT
                        She told me she was pregnant-- and 
                        I never saw or spoke to her again. 

           Justine pauses to stare up at him: you sonofabitch.

                                 COURT
                        Don’t jab me, I know how it sounds; 
                        that was the point. 

                                 JUSTINE 
                        You wanted to make her hate you?

           Court nods. Looks raw and open as his wounds--

                                 COURT
                        Easier to move on that way. I loved 
                        her. The best gift I could give her 
                        was ammunition to hate me.   

           INT. CHATEAU BEDROOM - MORNING

           Miranda is sitting with Fitzroy. His face has swollen 
           considerably. Mouth no longer bleeding, though. He can talk.  

                                 MIRANDA
                        I’m so sorry, dad--

                                 FITZROY
                        -- shhh. I wish you’d told me-- but 
                        I understand why you didn’t. 

           A little cough. He winces. 

                                 FITZROY
                        Makes sense why I never managed to 
                        track down Mr. Soren Fletcher from 
                        South Africa, though.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Picked up a few tricks from you. 

           Miranda starts to cry. Softly. Shaking. Wracked with guilt.

                                 FITZROY
                        Took you long enough. You were 
                        influenced from birth to fall for a 
                        man like your father. It’s not your 
                        fault that it happened. 

           Fitzroy’s warm. Steady. It helps. Guard eyes them both. 
                                 MIRANDA
                        I’m a mess, dad. We wouldn’t be 
                        here if it weren’t for him, but for 
                        the first time, I know he cares. If 
                        he makes it, I don’t have the 
                        slightest clue how I’ll react. 

                                 FITZROY
                        I’m somewhere between choking and 
                        hugging him, myself.

                                 MIRANDA
                             (gets a little smile)
                        Can he really do this?

                                 FITZROY 
                        If he succeeds, skill won’t be the 
                        deciding factor; the deck’s too 
                        stacked against him. I’d never 
                        argue you can’t loathe him for what 
                        he did, but you should understand 
                        what he’ll have to endure to save 
                        you. A father throwing his body in 
                        front of a train for his family is 
                        one thing. Court will have to do it 
                        piece-by-piece. 

           INT. SUV - COURT DRIVING - MORNING

           On a busier road, traffic passing. Justine looks up at him--

                                 JUSTIN,
                        Almost done. Just need to pull it 
                        tight. It will be the most painful 
                        part. I will be as gentle as I can. 

           ON THE WOUND-- pulling it tight. Slowly-- closes perfectly. 
           Bleeding stops. Justine smiles up at Court. Head hanging. 
           Passed out. She feels the SUV run off the road as we CUT TO--

           EXT. EDGE OF A FIELD - MORNING

           POV-- DARKNESS-- Court hears--

                                 JUSTINE (O.S.)
                        Please. Paul. Paul you must wake. 

           -- before Court opens his eyes, he instinctively reaches up, 
           grabs Justine by the neck-- then releases-- 

                                 COURT
                        Sorry. Sorry, Justine. 
           Court looks around. Sees the SUV fifty-yards away, she 
           must’ve dragged him into the brush. Doesn’t matter though, he 
           sees THREE POLICE CARS. POLICE have guns up. Aimed at him.

                                 JUSTINE
                        I could not wake you.

           Court looks the other way, sees THREE MORE OFFICERS, guns up, 
           coming in slowly. Very wary of him. Court looks at her. At 
           all of them. Even in desperation, they’ve got him.

           EXT. SUV - DAY

           POLICE find his SCORPION MACHINE PISTOL; a big deal here. 

           INT. CAR - DRIVING - DAY

           SWISS WATCHER, listening to a POLICE SCANNER, on his phone--

                                 SWISS WATCHER
                        Police have him; they’re waiting 
                        for backup before transport.  

           INT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Court, on the ground, wrist awkwardly handcuffed to an iron 
           BENCH. Watch shows: 12 hours left. Justine’s handcuffed next 
           to him. SIX POLICE nearby: TWO YOUNG, TWO OLD, TWO FAT.

           Court, eyes everywhere, marking traffic, looks out over 
           gingerbread homes sprinkled amongst more modern structures. 

                                 COURT
                        Justine, soon as we’re out of this, 
                        I’ll send detectives the whole 
                        story. You’ll be okay.

           She looks down. As if her life is over.

                                 JUSTINE
                        Out of this? Look around you. 

           Court, guilty, watches a road, twisting up and over a hill. A 
           DELIVERY TRUCK is parked at the top of the hill. Something 
           about it makes Court look downhill. Good thing-- THWIP! The 
           METAL BENCH SLAT right next to Court’s head FRAGMENTS! 

                                 COURT
                        Sniper-- everyone down! 

           Downhill, Court spots a VAN accelerating out of a gas 
           station. Uphill, the OTHER VAN is cooking towards them too. 
           Court, with his leg, pulls a LUGGAGE CART over to hide him. 
                                 COURT
                        Sergeant, you need to lay down 
                        cover fire on the sniper--

           POLICE fumble to draw guns, hampered by panic. Sergeant grabs 
           his walkie-talkie. Speaks in SWISS-GERMAN. Court hears what 
           he said, Court repeats it back in English--

                                 COURT
                        Not rescue me. Kill me. At least 
                        get Justine inside.
                             (Sergeant’s frozen)
                        They will kill your men to get to 
                        me. We have to work together to 
                        survive. Unlock my cuffs. 

           Sergeant takes a SNIPER BULLET to the head-- DOWNHILL VAN’S 
           DOORS OPEN. TWO MASKED MEN with MACHINE GUNS exit. Police, 
           behind benched and luggage carts, fire unpracticed rounds--

                                 COURT
                        UP THE HILL! SHOOT THE OTHER TRUCK!

           LOOKING UPHILL-- TWO MORE MASKED MEN, armed, leapfrog each 
           other, moving with quick confidence, like a pride of lions. 

           Court puts his boots against the iron legs of the bench, 
           kicking hard as he can with both feet while pulling with his 
           wrist, trying to break the iron piece he’s manacled to off. 
           Each kick cuts into his wrist. Agonizing pain. Justine, hugs 
           the ground, but her wrist is attached to the same bench. 

                                 COURT
                        Goddamnit, they’re flanking us!

           Police Man #6 barks for backup as SUPERSONIC ROUNDS stitch up 
           the concrete behind him-- into his legs and body-- his bloody 
           death throes last throughout the rest of the battle.  

           The Four Remaining Police ignore him, as they fire blind, 
           then reload slowly with jittery hands. Court’s still kicking! 
           His hand, cut off from circulation, is turning blue--

           BULLETS SHATTER GLASS ABOVE HIM, shards rain down on the 
           bench. SWISS POLICE #2 gets shot in the shoulder and hip, 
           writhing on the ground in agony-- bleeding-- and finally--

           -- Court breaks the bench arm free. Wrist still attached to a 
           thirty pound PIECE. He lifts, allowing Justine to get free. 

                                 COURT
                        Inside!

           She crawls inside as Court sprint-slides to Swiss Police #2-- 
                                 SWISS POLICE #2
                        Help me--

           Court yanks the handcuff key off his utility belt, grabs the 
           COPS GUN, rolls off the platform, onto the tracks. Unlocks 
           his shackle. Wrist swollen. Court crouch-runs low, below the 
           lip of the platform, peeks back over, sees--  

           TWO POLICE still in the fight. Crouched behind poor cover. 

                                 COURT
                        Come to me! 

           Court spots movement behind the TWO POLICE-- TWO GUNMEN run 
           through THE STATION, flanking position, got both Police Men 
           and Justine dead to rights-- Court stands, and from twelve 
           feet blasts a ROUND through GUNMAN #1’s head-- who’s body 
           whiplashes back into GUNMAN #2-- as he fights to get around-- 
           Court buries another shot through Gunman #2’s neck. 

                                 COURT
                        Slide me his rifle!

           Now that they’ve seen Court work, Police #3 grabs the RIFLE, 
           slides it-- Court yanks the mag, it’s full. Distant SIRENS--

                                 COURT
                        When I say go, you’re going to run 
                        up there, keeping her between you--

                                 SWISS OFFICER #3
                        Downhill to the left is open--

                                 COURT
                        -- that’s their kill zone.
                             (pointing to each spot)
                        Sniper. Team One. Team Two. Creates 
                        a tactical crescent designed to 
                        look like an escape route. Amateur 
                        hour’s fuckin’ over; you want to 
                        live, put your rifles on semi-auto, 
                        fire one round each direction ‘til 
                        you’re empty-- heading up there. 

           The TWO COPS nod. Court grabs his BAG. Addresses Justine--

                                 COURT 
                        Tell ‘em everything, just make sure 
                        police don’t arrive before 8 PM-- 

           Below the raised platform, Court runs across the tracks. 
           Then, using a house for cover, edges around it, hears a RIFLE 
           being reloaded. Hears the men YELLING IN ARABIC. 
           At ten feet, he steps around the corner, and on full auto--- 
           BLASTS ONE MORE GUNMEN! Looks up the hill at the DELIVERY 
           TRUCK. Empty. Ready to go. Court grabs a RIFLE. Pulls up the 
           mask: dead Lebanese. Turns back at the Train Station--

                                 COURT
                        Go!

           THE TWO SWISS POLICE SHIELD JUSTINE-- running uphill-- firing 
           back and forth as Court told them-- 

           COURT-- aims uphill, waiting for the SNIPER to SHIFT! Court 
           FIRES. Up the hill. Three shots, two hit. Sniper’s down.  

           THE TWO DOWNHILL GUNMEN-- 

           -- move parallel to the Police, trying to spot Court. About 
           to open fire on the POLICE running uphill-- 

           COURT fires up the hill, then spins. COVERING FIRE for Swiss 
           Police and Justine-- allowing them to drop behind an 
           embankment-- POLICE cars haul up from below. Court sees the 
           Gunmen retreat towards their van at the gas station. 

           Justine’s going to be okay, she looks back at him. He runs. 
           Leaps in the UPHILL TRUCK. Zooms off, and we DISSOLVE TO--

           INT. THE GIRLS BEDROOM - DAY

           -- Claire looking at their Guard. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I need to go to the bathroom. 

                                 GUARD
                        Leave the door open.

           INT. CHATEAU BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Door open, Guard’s shoulder visible. Claire turns the FAN ON 
           pulls the cell phone out. Hits send-- can hear Eva. Crying-- 

                                 EVA (O.S.)
                        I need to see my mom. I don’t feel 
                        well, and--

           She keeps BLATHERING while CLAIRE whispers--

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hello?

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        Claire? 
                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes. I stole a phone. We didn’t 
                        call the police, because of what 
                        they said they would do. 

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        That’s good. Is there a bad guy in 
                        the room with you?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes. 

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        Can you see out a window?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I got out through it.

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        Did you see where the sun rose?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Um. No. But it set to the-- 
                             (makes an L with her hand)
                        -- right of the window. 

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        What direction did you run? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Um. The apple orchard. I guess it 
                        would be towards where the sun set. 
                        There was loads of lawn.

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        Is the house made of stone?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes. It’s gray. A castle with a 
                        turret. There’s a church not far. 
                        The way the sun rises, I think. 

                                 COURT
                        What’s the color of the roof? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Wood. And I saw a pond.

           Guard pops his head in. Claire can’t hide the phone in time.

           INT. DELVERY VAN - PARKING LOT DAY

           Court has DRAWN A DIAGRAM from Claire’s answers. 
           A North-South configuration based on the sun: window-- apple 
           orchard-- pond-- lawn-- area of the church. ‘Stone’ ‘Turret’ 
           ‘Wood roof’. Not nearly enough. Spots a MAN parking an OPEL. 

           INT. FITZROY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Reigel holds Archer’s cell phone in one hand. A gun in the 
           other. Hovering over Fitzroy, gagged. Claire, crying in the 
           corner, must’ve told him everything, since Mr. Felix has 
           drawn a SIMILAR MAP.

                                 MR. FELIX
                        What if she called the--

                                 REIGEL
                        -- we’re in an isolated location 
                        for numerous reasons, one of which 
                        is a long standing ‘friendship’ 
                        with the local Gendarmerie. If she 
                        called them, we’d know.

           INT. STOLEN OPEL CAR - DAY

           Court’s looking towards a FANCY OLD BUILDING. EMPLOYEES exit, 
           streets are busy. Cafes are packed for lunch in-- 

                                 -GENEVA, SWITZERLAND-

           Watch shows: under 8 hours left. Frustration mounts-- CLOSE 
           ON THE DOOR: ‘HAMILTON AND ASSOCIATES’. ANDRE BAUMAN (50’s) 
           exits. BODYGUARD/DRIVER opens his CAR DOOR. 

           INT. MICHELIN-STARRED RESTAURANT - DAY 

           Court limps in. GORGEOUS BAR separate form the DINING AREA. 
           HOSTESS tries to stop him, he pushes past her into the bar, 
           behind the counter. Freezing FEMALE BARTENDER with one look--

           -- eyes on BAR GOODS. Prepped for every old school drink you 
           could make. Pockets her LIGHTER first, sees cleaning supplies 
           near the speed rack. Dumps a SPRAY BOTTLE. Grabs a bottle of 
           ‘CASK STRENGTH’ SCOTCH. Dumps it in the spray bottle along 
           with CAYENNE PEPPER. Screws sprayer on. Aims up. Sprays-- 

           -- flicks the lighter. FIREBALLS with each spray at the 
           ceiling-- until FIRE SPRINKLERS come on. Court heads into--

           THE MAIN DINING ROOM

           -- everyone’s hurrying out, getting soaked. Court marks--

                                 COURT
                        Andre Bauman?
                                 BAUMAN
                        I’m sorry. You are?

                                 COURT
                        The Gray Man.

           DRIVER/BODYGUARD is hurrying in behind Bauman. Court pushes 
           Bauman hard while squirting DRIVER/BODYGUARD in the eyes with 
           Scotch/Pepper. Drops him. Takes his KEYS-- and GUN. Locks an 
           arm bar on Bauman, turns him. 

           OUT IN THE STREET-- Court uses the CROWD for cover, pops the 
           trunk of Bauman’s car. Throws Bauman in.  

           EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

           Court opens the trunk. BAUMAN blinks. Climbs out. Court takes 
           BAUMAN’S SMARTPHONE, holds it in his hand with the gun. 

                                 COURT
                        I have two kids; they’re about to

                        I want you to understand what 
                        you’re dealing with; I don’t give 
                        one fuck about your life. You have 
                        a weapons cache and answers. If the 
                        things you tell me save my girls, 
                        I’ll call in your location when 
                        it’s over. Lie, flies will find 
                        your body way before the police do.   

                                 BAUMAN
                        Clever deal.

           Court pushes Bauman up the hill-- 

                                 COURT
                        Who’s after me?

                                 BAUMAN
                        Word is you’re being hunted by Kurt 
                        Reigel. Runs Risk Management 
                        Operations for LaurentGroup. He is 
                        amoral cubed.

                                 COURT
                        They have billions in Nigerian 
                        resource concessions. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COURT (cont'd)
                        Isaac Abubaker leveraged a favor, 
                        and sicced their attack dog on me?
                             (Bauman nods)
                        Your firm was the middleman. Who 
                        really hired me? CIA? DGSE? Who? 

                                 BAUMAN
                        You don’t know?

           Court has no energy for a game face. Doesn’t hide anything.

                                 BAUMAN
                        You thought it was about Uranium. 
                             (amazed, smirks)
                        Blinders of the hired gun; the 
                        entire operation was a set-up. 

           Court blinks. What? Bauman actually smiles. 

                                 BAUMAN
                        My client hired me to have the 
                        President-elect killed, then they 
                        made sure his brother thought CIA 
                        did it. The intention, from the 
                        start, was to push Isaac Abubaker, 
                        and Nigeria, away from the West. 

                                 COURT
                        Who’s intention? Who’s they?

                                 BAUMAN
                        China. 

           As if Court’s life wasn’t bad enough. 

                                 BAUMAN
                        They’re busily scooping up the 
                        resources of Sudan, Niger, Congo; 
                        all the countries the West has 
                        embargoed. All countries the West 
                        refuses to deal with. Resource-rich 
                        Nigeria is a prize, but Western 
                        powers have a death grip on it. 
                        China’s trying to shake it away. 

                                 COURT
                        And coming after me?

                                 BAUMAN
                        All I know is that part wasn’t 
                        planned. You finally get to 
                        understand what ‘it’s nothing 
                        personal’ feels like.   
           Arriving at a WELL. Bauman looks in; angry and fearful.

                                 BAUMAN
                        Tell Madame Laurent the truth, 
                        broker it for your children’s 
                        release. She never lets emotion 
                        trump her bottom line. 

                                 COURT
                        My girls have seen Reigel’s face. 

           Bauman reacts: death sentence, and we CUT TO-- 

           INT. STORAGE UNIT - OUTSIDE GENEVA - DAY 

           -- Court unlocking a DIGITAL COMBINATION. Enters. Pulls the 
           cover off a BRAND NEW MERCEDES S-CLASS. IN THE TRUNK-- he’s 
           looking down on four aluminum cases, side-by-side:

           INSIDE #1: an H & K MP-5 with AMMO and TWO GRENADES. 

           INSIDE #2: MORE GRENADES. FLASHBANGS. BREACHING CHARGES. And 
           a CUBE OF SEMTEX EXPLOSIVE with a TWO REMOTE DETONATORS.

           INSIDE #3: TWO GLOCK 19 PISTOLS. SILENCERS. AMMO. 

           Underneath the carpet, one more treasure. A TAC-50 SNIPER 
           RIFLE with ammo. A HUGE GUN. Watch shows: 6 hours left.

           EXT/INT. MERCEDES - DAY

           Court’s using the INTERNET on the car’s NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
           Fast searches combined with cross-checks of GOOGLE EARTH. 

           Begins with a thirty kilometer radius around ‘Bayeux, 
           Normandy’. Searching churches. Has the DIAGRAM on his lap. 
           Knows from the angle of the sun, the church is Southeast of 
           the Chateau. Going to take awhile, but he’s got hours. 

           Church-- Orchards-- Chateau. Fields of SHEEP-- CATTLE. Apple 
           orchards-- vineyards-- spots the ‘NORMANDY AMERICAN 
           CEMETERY’. A grid of WHITE CROSSES. Keeps going-- 

           Checks his stomach. The STITCHES are oozing a bit of blood. 
           Not good. He heaves, goes back to the search. 

                                 REIGEL (PRE-LAP)
                        Our target has enough to figure out 
                        our location. There’s no longer any 
                        point chasing him all over France.

                        kilometers covered-- 

           -- HELICOPTER circles. TWO PILOTS. TWO SNIPERS in the back.

           TWELVE OPERATORS (all our survivors) study a map.

                        Our two best units, Grom and SSG 
                        have suffered few casualties. 
                        Survivors of the other units will 
                        reinforce them; gives us two five-
                        man hunter killer teams, and Two 
                        Snipers in the helicopter.  

           EXT. CHATEAU GROUNDS - DAY

           Reigel and Mr. Felix approach ENGINEERS TRENCHING LINES for 
           EXTENSION CORDS-- then fold the grass back over, hiding it. 

                                 REIGEL
                        If he manages to evade them, he’ll 
                        still have to attack a fortified 
                        position supported by eight more 
                        soldiers and a 360 degree wall of 
                        surveillance bearing bullet wounds, 
                        sleep deprivation, and a lacerated 
                        abdomen.

           CAMERAS, THERMAL SENSORS are being attached to trees.

                                 MR. FELIX
                        After what he’s done, your 
                        overconfidence is unsettling.

                                 REIGEL
                        Overconfidence? I can smell a fox 
                        pissed here. Taste rotted apples on 
                        my tongue. It’s like a General 
                        forced back to the front, realizing 
                        how much he missed it.   

                                 MR. FELIX

                        Fear. Logic tells me he’s a dead 
                        man; my body’s making sure I don’t 
                        forget we’re taking on the most 
                        efficient killer since Oppenheimer. 
                             (studying Mr. Felix)
                        This is what you wanted, isn’t it? 
                        Or was personal jeopardy not part 
                        of your equation?

           INT. COURT’S MERCEDES - LATE AFTERNOON

           Sun has travelled across the sky. Court’s driving through 
           beautiful vineyards. Golden hour approaching. NAV SYSTEM

           A CHURCH POPS UP. THEN SATELLITE IMAGE OF THE CHATEAU-- spot 
           checks his list: All there!

           Elation fades as he examines the target. Won’t be easy. A 
           HUGE OPEN ZONE surrounding the entire estate. Don’t need to 
           read his mind to see the concern: how do you cross it?

           INT. CHATEAU KITCHEN - DAY

                                 COURT 
                        Hello Kurt. 

                                 REIGEL
                        You’ve been sleuthing. Police 
                        reports had you in Geneva at noon. 
                        Better hurry, it’s a five hour 
                        drive. 

                                 COURT 
                        Turn around.

           REIGEL smiles. We see it takes an effort not to look.

                                 REIGEL
                        I wish. I saw the footage from the 
                        bridge; if you make it here, I’ll 
                        be able to kill you with a spoon.

                        Still got a spark of life. 

                                 COURT
                        Let me talk to them. 

                                 REIGEL
                        They’re fine. You’ll have to take 
                        my word for it. 

                                 COURT
                        Where are they, specifically?

                                 REIGEL
                        I’m sure you’ll be able to figure 
                        it out. It was a good description.

                                 COURT
                        Tricked by a little girl, Kurt?

                        Suppose I shouldn’t be surprised, 
                        given the gene pool. 

           -- Court (maintaining his track record) hangs up on him.

                                 MR. FELIX
                        What did he say? In German? 

                                 REIGEL

                                 REIGEL (O.S. FILTERED)
                        Target is heading towards you.

                                 SSG LEADER
                        Copy. He will not be able to drive 
                        through here. 

           SHEEP DOG nips and barks, herding SHEEP down the lane. 
           Towards the CHATEAU-- blocking the entire road. Three 
           Pakistani SSG and Lebanese #1 eye them. Hidden. 

                                 SSG LEADER
                             (in Arabic)
                        (You speak French, yes?)
                             (Lebanese nods)
                        (Tell the Shepard to turn back.)

                                 LEBANESE
                        (What if it’s Gentry?)

                                 SSG LEADER
                        (It’s not. The dog’s responding to 
                        his owners commands.)
           Lebanese nods. Steps out-- others cover. Staying hidden.

           INT. MERCEDES - EVENING

           Map: 2 kilometers. 7:30 PM. Court crushes the FOUR PILLS on 
           the dash with the his knife, scoops it all into his mouth. 

           Drugs hit like spinach for popeye. Eyes dilate. Looks at the 
           FRONT WINDSHIELD. Then at his STOMACH. BLOOD coming out. 

           EXT. WOODSY ROAD - EVENING

           SSG LEADER sees the MERCEDES roll over the hill. FRONT 
           WINDSHIELD SMEARED WITH BLOOD-- can’t see if anyone’s inside. 
           Not going fast. Sheep jog out of the way, not spooked. But 
           LEBANESE #1 knows it bad, pulls Shepard over the wall as--

           EXT. THE WOODS - DUSK

           -- COURT runs, carrying the heavy TAC 50. GRENADES hang on 
           webbing. He’s LOADED WITH WEAPONS. Pulls out one of the 
           REMOTE DETONATORS. Lays down-- eyes in the SCOPE--

           SCOPE POV-- looking at CATTLE. PANNING TO THE ATV--

           EXT. STONE FENCE - DAY

           Russian GROM watch the CATTLE herded by the MAN ON THE ATV-- 
           heading towards them. GROM LEADER-- puts his gun down. 
           Hurdles the fence. His Team covers him. Staying hidden--

           MAN ON ATV looks at his military camo. Hops off. 

                                 RUSSIAN GROM LEADER
                             (perfect French, friendly)
                        (Sorry, sir. A group of us are in 
                        from Paris, big paintball match. 
                        Your cattle could cause injuries.)

                                 LEBANESE #1 (O.S. FILTERED)
                             (alarmed)
                        This shepard said a man wired him 
                        money and bought all his sheep--

           EXT. WOODS - DUSK

           -- Court jams his finger on the REMOTE DETONATOR-- THEN 
           STARTS SHOOTING!

           INT. MERCEDES - CONTINUOUS

           -- a SEMTEX EXPLOSIVE CHARGE under the seat BLOWS UP! 
           EXT. ATV - CONTINUOUS

           -- Bullets pepper the ATV FUEL TANK-- AND BOOM!!! WE CUT TO--

           INT. EAGLE’S NEST - CHATEAU - DUSK

           -- SNIPER and SPOTTER scan their respective areas:

           -100 TERRIFIED SHEEP stampede towards them from the West.

           -200 TERRIFIED CATTLE rumble in over the LAWN from the East! 
           From up here, we see TWO GROM get trampled to death!

           EXT. NEAR THE FAR SIDE OF THE APPLE ORCHARD - DUSK

           Court, quietly, shifts in low grass, right next to a STONE 
           FENCE. TAC-50 in hand. Court looks at his watch-- 7:50 PM. 

           INT. EAGLE’S NEST - DUSK

           SNIPER and SPOTTER, see a muzzle flash-- too late to react. 
           SNIPER’s HEAD WHIPS BACK! 

           SPOTTER POV - BINOCULARS WHIPPING AROUND TO SEE--

           Court leaping the fence, left his rifle behind, as his SECOND 
           BULLET FILLS THE FRAME, we SMASH CUT TO--

           INT. CHATEAU CELLAR - DUSK

           -- thermals, motion sensors, cameras show-- CATTLE AND SHEEP. 
           Rendering all their technology completely worthless--

           INT. APPLE ORCHARD - DUSK

           Court runs through the same area Archer was shot--

           -- then he THROWS THE OTHER SEMTEX CHARGE at the main ENTRY 
           GATE-- not far away--

           EXT. EDGE OF THE ORCHARD - CLOSER TO CHATEAU - MOMENT LATER 

           Court, in the trees, runs perpendicular to the Chateau, 
           eyeing the kill zone. A hundred yards of grass. Looks at his 
           watch: 7:52. 8 minutes left. Yanks pins on--

           THREE GRENADES-- THROWS

           -ONE LEFT, far as he can. 
           -ONE RIGHT, far as he can, and the third-- 
           -STRAIGHT AHEAD, out into the MIDDLE OF THE GRASSY LAWN--
           INT. CHATEAU - DUSK

           A SECOND FLOOR WINDOW-- THREE GUARDS, weapons up-- see a 
           GRENADE EXPLODE in front of them. Sheep and CATTLE race 
           around. Totally freaked out--

           INT. CHATEAU - DUSK

           A DIFFERENT SECOND FLOOR WINDOW--

           THREE MORE GUARDS see the FLASH OF the FIRST GRENADE to their 
           left, then the SECOND ONE BLOWS UP to their right-- then--

           THEY SEE COURT-- running towards them as the THIRD GRENADE 
           EXPLODES right in front of them and we SMASHCUT TO-- 

           EXT. ON COURT - MIDDLE OF THE LAWN - CONTINUOUS

           -- diving. RIFLE in front of his head to block shrapnel. 
           Knows he’s far enough away to survive the EXPLOSION 
           ASSAULTING HIS SENSES. Moment it’s safe, he’s back up, 
           charging through the COVER OF SMOKE. DIRT, GRASS, rain down! 

           Running-- the SIDE OF THE HOUSE appears. Fuckin’ made it! He 
           buries himself against the stone wall, ivy snaking up. 

           Looks back at the main gate, where he sees A VEHICLE RACING 
           TOWARDS THE CHATEAU-- full of SSG-

           Gasping for air, he pulls out his REMOTE DETONATOR. BLOOD 
           draining on the ground. Tons of it. Stitches popped. 

           THE VEHICLE drives right through the gate-- and COURT BLOWS 
           THE SECOND SEMTEX CHARGE! Like an IED, the kill zone is 
           seventy feet, VEHICLE BLOWS SIDEWAYS from the shockwave, whip-
           rolling across the lawn. 

           Court’s eyes turn, sees TWO GROM charging in back towards the 
           house-- two hundred yards out. He FIRES to slow them down, 
           then-- smashes the window above him, leaps up-- 

           IN THE LIBRARY

           -- he looks at his watch, 7:54. Six minutes left. Rounds the 
           corner, into-- MR. FELIX. Court, gun up, right at him--

                                 MR. FELIX
                        I’m just the Butler sir!

                                 COURT
                        A Nigerian Butler?
                             (beat, gun at his face)
                        I look like I care if I’m wrong?
                                 MR. FELIX
                        Cellar. They’re in the cellar. 

           INT. TECH HUB - CELLAR - MORNING

           Tech is working, definitely on edge. Waiting. SIX GUARDS 
           surround Reigel. ONE CAMERA FEED shows COURT’S BACK--

                                 TECH
                        Gentry’s inside!

                                 REIGEL
                        All assets collapse on me. Use the 
                        back cellar entry!

           Watching HELMET camera feeds: TWO GROM run back--

                                 REIGEL
                        Upend all the tables; you three 
                        cover that entry, you three cover 
                        the rear stairwell. 

           Reigel opens HEAVY DOORS to the SIDE ROOM, sees the Fitzroy’s 
           all tied up. Alive. Their Two Guards look nervous. Reigel 
           better get his men under control--

           -- the TWO GROM OPERATORS enter through a CELLAR ENTRY.

                                 REIGEL
                        Two minutes. He’s on deaths door-- 

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                             (from the stairwell)
                        Wrong again, Kurt--

           INT. STONE STAIRWAY - NIGHT

           -- not really, though. It’s bluster, since Court is white as 
           a ghost. Bleeding to death as he forces Mr. Felix down the 
           stairs ahead of him. Pulls his last grenade out, YANKS the 
           pin. Holding the spoon down in his hand.

                                 COURT
                        Your innocent Nigerian Butler is 
                        about to step out.

                                 MR. FELIX
                        It’s Felix! Do not shoot!

           Court eases him out, around the corner, allows Court to a 
           peek of what he’s up against-- SIX SOLDIERS BEHIND TABLES, in 
           front of a THICK PAIR OF DOUBLE DOORS-- 
                                 MR. FELIX
                             (eyeing all the guns)
                        No one else can confirm he’s dead. 
                        No confirmation, no money.

           ON COURT-- that’s a piece.

                                 REIGEL (O.S.)
                        One minute left. Then there’s no 
                        reason to keep the Fitzroy’s alive.

           Court’s eyes are everywhere. 

                                 COURT
                        Felix here is about to die, means 
                        no one gets paid. But I won’t kill 
                        anyone I see protecting the 
                        Fitzroy’s-- 

           Court takes his finger off the GRENADE SPOON-- live. Five 
           second fuse-- Felix tries to struggle. Court’s got him under 
           control. Court throws the Grenade out into the room--

                                 COURT
                        -- the rest of you--   

           ON THE GRENADE - SLOW MOTION - 

                                 COURT (O.S.)
                        -- are fucked. 

           - EXPLODING IN MID-AIR! Shockwave SHATTERS EVERYTHING-- 
           CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES, CALVADOS CASKS-- SHREDDING MR. FELIX since-
           - COURT’S using him for cover, already running in BEHIND as--

           COURT throws Felix’s body over the Barricade--

           -- TWO GUARDS dive into the ROOM WITH THE FITZROYS-- slam the 
           doors before Court can get there. 

           Court sees TWO MORE, bleeding, grabbing weapons. Court kills 
           them. The TECH is crawling away, Court shoots him in the back 
           of the head. Killing everything between him and the doors,   
           a real life reaper, looking for Reigel. Doesn’t see him. 

           Court’s watch ALARM BLEEPS. Time’s up. Falls to his knees, 
           whole side is slick with blood all the way down to his boots-- 
           gets his feet back. Heads towards-- 

           THE HUGE DOORS 

           Court doesn’t know what he’ll find in there. We’re as blind 
           as he is as he kicks the door. One, two, three times until--
           IT CRASHES OPEN

           Court rolls back. Peeks to see the Fitzroy’s, tied up. Eva 
           and Claire are blindfolded. Two Guards beside them. One still 
           has a gun. Aimed down. No chances-- Court puts a bullet 
           through his head-- rolls back behind the wall for cover.

                                 COURT
                             (talking around the wall)
                        If they’re not cut loose next time 
                        I look, I double-tap your throat. 

           ON GUARD-- unshackles Fitzroy. Lays on the ground. Fitzroy 
           quickly frees Miranda. Court peeks in at the girls. First 
           time he’s seen them up close. Then his eyes meet--

                                 COURT
                        Miranda. 

           First time she’s seen him in nearly a decade. He makes sure 
           to keep his body tucked behind the door. Blood at his feet. 
           Glances around the CELLAR ROOM. A fucking slaughterhouse--

                                 COURT
                        Keep the blindfolds on the girls. 

           Miranda picks up both girls. Heavy, but knows she has to be 
           the mule. Fitzroy and Court can’t carry them and fight.

           Fitzroy, finally free, invigorated. Strips GUARD of a knife. 
           Court leads them out. Miranda with the girls. FITZROY last, 
           viper-quick stabs Guard in the neck. Whispers in his ear-- 

                                 FITZROY
                        I didn’t make a deal. 

           INT. TEN CAR GARAGE - MORNING

           Filled with at least a million dollars of CARS. Court raps on 
           the rear GLASS of a BENTLEY, ‘TINK TINK’. Moves on to a 7-
           series BMW, raps glass ‘TUNK-TUNK’. Armored. Sees a WALL 
           LOCKER. Unlocked. He grabs the keys. Throws them to Fitzroy. 

           Eva and Claire still blindfolded. Miranda’s staring at him; 
           eyes locked on the absolute wreckage of his body. 

           Court doesn’t have the energy to say anything. Just a quick 
           self-conscious look. Acknowledging so much with so little-- 

                                 COURT
                        Fitz. I’ll cover you.

           Fitzroy opens the GARAGE DOOR-- hops into the driver’s seat. 
           Court pulls BAUMAN’S CELL out, hands it to Fitzroy--
                                 COURT
                        Give that to Madame Laurent. 

           No time for questions, the Fitzroy’s drive off. Court, rifle 
           in hand stays conscious, almost done. Runs up the steps as-- 

           REIGEL RUNS DOWN-- 

           -- neither one of them get their guns out in time-- they 
           barrel into each other! Court, coming in lower, gets Reigel, 
           lifting him into the air, and--

           EXT. POOL AREA - GLOAMING

           -- crashing out, into TABLES, a CABINET filled with DISHES, 
           FORKS, SPOONS, KNIVES. Court’s lost most of his blood, weak. 
           Reigel is uninjured, PUNCHING DOWN ON COURT’S FACE, laying 
           waste to it; sees the FLATWARE all over. Grabs a SPOON, 
           shoves it in Court’s mouth, tries to jam it down his throat--

                                 REIGEL
                        I told you.

           Court hears something. Reigel drops the spoon, pulls Court’s 
           head up so he can see a POLICE HELICOPTER CIRCLING-- POLICE 
           streak towards the gate-- surrounding Armored car-- 

                                 REIGEL
                        Think they’re safe now, don’t you?

           Reigel smirks. Shakes his head. Court, ungodly willpower, 
           summons everything-- wrangles his leg between Reigel’s, and 
           grappling, flips Reigel, they roll towards the water-- 

           Court, twisting Reigel’s joints. We hear a POP. Reigel’s leg 
           is now out of it’s socket. He screams! Court pops Reigel’s 
           other leg out. Moves on to Reigel’s arm, POP, then the other. 

           He pushes Reigel into the pool face up. Court gently takes 
           the spoon, puts it in Reigel’s mouth, rolls him over to 
           drown. Court collapses. Eyes the sky. That’s it. They close.

           IN DARKNESS - MINUTE LATER

           A voice, in French. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        (If I couldn’t see inside him, I’d 
                        think he was made of something 
                        else.)  

           COURT OPENS HIS EYES-- being carried on a stretcher towards a 
           Medevac. FOUR POLICE OFFICERS surround him, guns in hand. 
           FITZROY, MIRANDA, CLAIRE, AND EVA 

           Are being kept back as they pass. The girls, blindfolds gone, 
           stare at their father-- 

                                 EVA
                        That’s Grandad’s good friend?

           Court looks at his girls. At Fitzroy. At Miranda. All he can 
           muster, but he manages to give his head a little shake.

                                 MIRANDA
                         No. His friend didn’t come. 

                                 CLAIRE
                         Then who’s that?

           Hardest thing in the world to say. Eyes locked on Court.

                                 MIRANDA
                         That’s nobody. 

           We FADE OUT-- hearing only the Blip. Blip. Blip of the EKG,  
           in DARKNESS. As it FLATLINES, we DISSOLVE TO--  

           INT. OFFICE - LONDON - DAY

           SEAL OF MI-6 on a MONITOR. Then ISAAC ABUBAKER appears, 
           getting a standing ovation from Congress. PULL BACK TO REVEAL-
           - Madame Laurent watching with the HEAD OF MI-6.

                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        Sounds like Nigeria has a bone to 
                        pick with China. Good news all 
                        around. 

                                 HEAD OF MI-6
                        Nigeria’s new President has also 
                        agreed to cancel their Uranium 
                        contract with Syria. Leaves one 
                        last detail to address. This was 
                        sent to President Abubaker--

           Opens an EMAIL FILE SHOWING: Andre Bauman, in the woods. 
           (Court recorded their meeting on Bauman’s Smartphone)

                                 BAUMAN (RECORDED)
                        ...the intention, from the start, 
                        was to push Isaac Abubaker, and 
                        Nigeria, away from the West.

           He fast-forwards--
                                 HEAD OF MI-6
                        This last section-- was not--

           FOOTAGE CUTS TO: Court, recorded while driving the Mercedes-- 

                                 COURT (RECORDED)
                        I marked Bauman’s location on this 
                        phone’s map. Madame Laurent, I know 
                        why you came after me. Bauman’s 
                        information will allow you to keep 
                        your contracts. Long as Reigel’s 
                        dead, you’ll have no reason to harm 
                        the Fitzroys. 

                                 HEAD OF MI-6
                        We have Bauman. We know everything. 

                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        I’m afraid Mr. Reigel went mad. 
                        Dangerous business, working in 
                        Africa. Infects the mind. 

                                 HEAD OF MI-6
                        Spare me. Fortunately for you, all 
                        of us want this business forgotten. 
                        So long as the Fitzroy’s remain 
                        safe, none of it ever happened.

                                 MADAME LAURENT
                        Sir Donald agreed to this?
                             (he nods)
                        He’s hardly a forgiving man. 

                                 HEAD OF MI-6
                        He agreed to honor the terms as a 
                        tribute-- to his friend. 

           He offers his hand. She takes it, sealing the deal.

           EXT. BRITISH ESTATE - DAY

           CLOSE ON-- FEET OF A FOX-- sprinting across a CREEK      
           CLOSE ON-- PAWS OF HOUNDS -- hot on it’s heels.          
           CLOSE ON-- HOOVES OF HORSES-- running flat out.           
           WIDER ON-- MADAME LAURENT, in fox-hunting gear. 

           BA-BOOM!! Her red coat explodes in crimson; DOUBLE-BARREL-
           BLASTED off her horse! 

           A FIGURE, in duck hunting gear, steps from the foliage. 
           Calmly, strolls towards her. We don’t see a face, just 
           SNIPPETS AND IMAGES of the body, not enough to tell who it 
           is. Could be old, or young. Male or female. Can’t tell.
           MADAME LAURENT-- looks up. A glimmer of recognition on her 
           face, or maybe-- it’s just the strain of sucking her last 
           breaths through lungs punched like a colander.     

           OTHER RIDERS watch. Zero surprise; a set-up for certain. 
           Especially when we see one rider is Head of MI-6.

                                 HEAD OF MI-6
                        Dangerous sport, hunting. 

           He looks at the FIGURE, already disappearing into the woods. 
           A shadow in foliage, then nothing, and we FADE OUT. 

                                 -THE END-
