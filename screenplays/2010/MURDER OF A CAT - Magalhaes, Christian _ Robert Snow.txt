        Beverly Hills, CA 90211
           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           We TRACK through the town of BETHANY, NY, a typical Northeast 
           American suburb, past a sign that reads BOXWOOD LANE. Prefab 
           houses, towering elms, landscaped lawns, gyrating sprinklers.

           EXT. MESSY SUBURBAN LAWN - CONTINUOUS

           A rusty sign: “THE MOISEY EMPORIUM: The Collector’s Refuge,” 
           marks yard sale trying desperately to be a legit store. 

           We TRACK across a table lined with boxed action figures, 
           carefully organized comic books, and encased baseball cards. 
           Everything is priced. 

           A plucky boy, TREVOR (10), looks over the merchandise 
           disinterestedly. 

                                 TREVOR 
                        Stuff sucks.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Alright, kid, you want some top 
                        shelf quality? This is my own 
                        personal line, the Doghouse Series--

           A hand raises a home-made ACTION FIGURE wearing a trench coat 
           and fedora.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Doghouse Reilly. Age: unknown. Eye 
                        color: cobalt. Intelligence: 
                        unparalleled. Occupation: 
                        trillionaire detective. 

                                 TREVOR
                        Where’s he from? 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        He is known to have lived in every 
                        country, but he prefers the 
                        solitude of his caved mansion off 
                        the coast of Chongming where he 
                        lives with his trusty cat, Mouser, 
                        and feeds solely on indigenous 
                        algae and zebra meat. 

           Beat.

                                 TREVOR
                        Sounds gay.
           CLINTON MOISEY, disheveled but intense, holds the toy 
           delicately. Uncouth hair hangs over his eyes, six-day old 
           stubble protrudes from his chin, and a terry cloth robe hangs 
           over a body that hasn’t seen exercise in years. 

                                 CLINTON
                        You’re gay kid. Doghouse would 
                        punch out your whole family for 
                        that remark. 

           Trevor pops a Sour Patch Kid. He glances at a TABBY CAT 
           sleeping on the side of the table.

                                 TREVOR 
                        That cat for sale? 

                                 CLINTON
                        Is that a real question?

                                 TREVOR
                        He’s on the table.

                                 CLINTON
                        So is your hand. Is that for sale?

           Trevor shakes his head.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Great, so please remove it. And 
                        yourself from my lawn.

                                 TREVOR
                        Loser. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Doll kisser.

           Trevor walks off. 

           Clinton sighs and delicately places the action figure back 
           onto the display table. 

           EDIE MOISEY (50s), Clinton’s kind but doting mother, emerges 
           from the house. An old soul and a bit of a pushover. She 
           wears a house dress and holds a CAT CARRIER. 

                                 EDIE
                        Clinton, what did you say to that 
                        boy?

           Clinton suddenly looks at his wrist watch. 
                                 CLINTON
                        Ma, we’re gonna be late!

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           The tabby cat, MOUSER (17), rests lethargically on an exam 
           table. He lets out a yawn. 

                                 CLINTON
                        See that? This is exactly what I’m 
                        talking about. He’s not himself. 
                        He’s sleeping all the time, eating 
                        less, staring blankly into space. 

           The veterinarian, DR. DIKEMBE KULU (40s), tall, stoic, 
           African, observes Mouser. 

                                 DR. KULU
                            (heavy accent)
                        I don’t know, sir. He is a cat. 

                                 CLINTON
                        No, something’s off. He’s been 
                        disappearing for days at a time and 
                        there’s something wrong with his 
                        hair.

                                 DR. KULU
                        Yes, he looks vibrant, have you 
                        been grooming him?

                                 CLINTON
                        What? No, it must be some kind of 
                        vibrant-hair-shedding disease. And 
                        watch this.

           Clinton ruffles Mouser’s ears. He doesn’t stir. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        See? Nothing. That is not normal. 
                        It’s like he feels nothing anymore.

                                 DR. KULU
                        For a 17 year old cat he appears 
                        quite healthy. 

                                 CLINTON
                        I think it’s depression. 

           Clinton sighs. He lies back-down on the exam table.
                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Truth is, doc, things haven’t been 
                        so good. Nothing makes him happy 
                        anymore, his will and spirit are 
                        gone. Just gone.

           Dr. Kulu peers at him for a moment. 

                                 DR. KULU
                        I’m a veterinarian. You may want to  
                        visit a psychiatrist.

           Clinton looks up. 

                                 CLINTON
                        A psychiatrist, huh? They have 
                        those for cats now?

           EXT. VETERINARY LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Edie sits on a couch, chatting with an attractive college-age 
           GIRL who pets a WHITE FERRET.

           Clinton emerges from the office with Mouser in his arms and a 
           dire look on his face.

                                 EDIE
                        Hey, hon, this is Jenny and her 
                        ferret--

                                 CLINTON
                        No time, ma. 

           Clinton marches out. Edie and Jenny share an awkward look.

                                 EDIE
                        He’s...very tired. 

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Edie’s station wagon.  Edie drives. Clinton rides passenger. 

                                 EDIE
                        She was a nice girl, Clinton, you 
                        could at least make an effort.

           Clinton holds up his doctor’s slip.

                                 CLINTON
                        Ma, we have to make an appointment 
                        with this--Dr. Sloan in Harrisburg. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLINTON (CONT'D)
                        Dr. Kulu says he’s the best 
                        therapist in the Tri-state area.

                                 EDIE
                        Harrisburg, Pennsylvania? 
                            (sighs)
                        This is why you need to get your 
                        license.

           Clinton looks at her, insulted.

                                 CLINTON
                        I’m talking about Mouser’s well 
                        being here and you’re bugging me 
                        about driver’s licenses? 
                        Unbelievable, ma.

           Edie rolls her eyes. She pulls into the left lane.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? 

                                 EDIE
                        I need a few things. I’m just gonna 
                        stop by Ford’s for a minute.

           She indicates a large, looming shopping center in the 
           distance, FORD’S MEGASTORE.

                                 CLINTON
                        If you pull into that parking lot, 
                        I will throw myself from this car.

                                 EDIE
                        Oh stop.

                                 CLINTON
                        You know very well that store is 
                        against everything I believe. 

           She starts to veer in. 

           Clinton clutches the door handle and looks at her 
           threateningly. A showdown.

                                 EDIE
                        Not this time. I really don’t care. 
                        Throw yourself if you want.

           She glares at him and continues to drive toward the store.

           Clinton opens the door and dangles his foot outside. 
           She presses on, determined. Clinton unbuckles his seat belt 
           and prepares to leap.

           Edie suddenly pulls VEERS back onto the road. Clinton wins.

                                 EDIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re impossible!

           Clinton closes the door and sighs. 

                                 CLINTON
                        It killed my business, ma. Now I’m 
                        stuck running a yard sale.

                                 EDIE
                        You ran a corner comic shop for six 
                        months! You never made a cent! What 
                        does Ford’s Megastore have to do 
                        with anything?!

                                 CLINTON
                        It scared away my clientele. 

                                 EDIE
                        What Clientele? The store was 
                        doomed, Clinton.

                                 CLINTON
                        This coming from my number one 
                        investor. 
                            (sadly)
                        You’ve changed, ma. 

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The room of an overgrown child. Meticulously organized 
           comics, model airplanes, boxed action figures. 

           Clinton lounges on a futon and munches on a bag of pork 
           rinds. He watches a rerun of “Step by Step.” 

                                 CLINTON
                            (to the TV)
                        Cody, Dana loves you. That’s what 
                        she’s trying to tell you!

           Edie clops down the stairs. 

                                 EDIE
                        Clinton, “mac and chee” is in the 
                        fridge. 
           Clinton sniffs the air and turns to her. 

                                 CLINTON
                        You smell gasoline? Is there a gas 
                        leak?

                                 EDIE
                        It’s perfume, Clinton. 

                                 CLINTON
                        What is that, lipstick? You’re not 
                        going on date are you?

                                 EDIE
                        I can’t dress up? Not that it’s any 
                        of your business.

                                 CLINTON
                        Hey, I’m just trying to protect you 
                        from the douche bags you seem to 
                        attract. 

                                 EDIE
                        Douche bags?

                                 CLINTON
                        Douche bags, scum bags, dirt bags. 
                        All the bags. 

                                 EDIE
                        Thank you, Clinton. As you know, I 
                        haven’t had a date in years.

           A faraway look comes over her.

                                 CLINTON
                            (belly laugh)
                        HAHAHAHAH!
                            (To Edie)
                        Not you, ma, the show.

           She shakes her head and disappears up the stairs. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Hey, ma, where’d you say the--

           Clinton turns to find her gone. He sighs.

                            (buttery voice)
                        Hi folks, I’m Al Ford, owner and 
                        founder of Ford’s Megastore, where 
                        our motto is “you steal from us.” 
           CLOSE UP on TV: A handsome WASPy man, ALISTAIR FORD (50s), in 
           a sport coat and pleated Khakis stands proudly in the aisle 
           of a retail store.

           He hands a wad of cash to a pleasantly surprised costumer.

                                 FORD
                        We have it all here at the 
                        Megastore! Electronics?

           Ford joyfully types on a laptop. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Of course! Sporting goods?

           Ford cocks a rifle and flashes a hammy smile. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You betcha! Toys for the kids?

           A grinning CHILD holds a kite. Ford ruffles his hair.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Absolutely! 

           Ford stands in front of a line of smiling EMPLOYEES. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        It’s all here at Ford’s Megastore! 
                        Where you steal from us everyday! 

           A SHOE careens into the television console. CLICK.

           Clinton glares at the blank screen.

                                 CLINTON
                        Phony prick. 

           Clinton turns to Mouser, who sits perched on a sill, gazing 
           out the window.

           Clinton walks over to Mouser and gently picks him up. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        What’s out there bud, what are you 
                        looking at? 

           Clinton slouches back into his chair, places Mouser in his 
           BED and pets him on the belly. Mouser doesn’t react.

           Clinton picks up a cat TOY and dangles it above Mouser.
                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Mouse, Mouse, look. Look.

           No reaction. Clinton sighs.

           After a moment, Mouser gently crawls onto Clinton’s lap. He 
           places his paws on Clinton’s chest and looks up at him.

           Clinton looks into his eyes. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Hey you.

           Mouser continues to stare at him for a pregnant moment. He 
           then lays onto Clinton’s lap and closes his eyes.

           Clinton smiles.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           A ray of moonlight through the window. The sound of 
           television STATIC. 

           FWAP. FWAP. 

           Clinton stirs awake. He looks around groggily. 

           He turns to find Mouser’s bed empty.

                                 CLINTON
                        Mouser?

           FWAP FWAP. He looks up to find the basement WINDOW swaying in 
           the wind.

           He drifts back to sleep.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. BASEMENT - MORNING

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!

           Clinton awakens with a start. He rubs his eyes. 

           He pries himself off the futon and makes his way to the 
           window. He peers out. 

           A crowd has gathered on the street in front of his house. 
                                 CLINTON
                        The hell?

           EXT. CLINTON’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Clinton, in robe and slippers, exits his house. 

           He approaches the gathering at the foot of his drive. 
           Suddenly, he stops in his tracks.

           The MOISEY EMPORIUM sign has been knocked over and trampled. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Are you kidding me?

           Clinton marches up to the sign and stands it back up. He 
           brushes some dirt off, then turns to the crowd. 

           An over-snacked FAT KID, a concerned FATHER consoling a 
           sobbing GIRL, and a passerby JOGGER stare at something on the 
           ground, OFF-SCREEN. 

           Clinton notices Edie behind them, a look of detached grief on 
           her face.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Ma?...Ma, what’s going on?

           Edie is silent. Clinton slowly approaches the crowd.

           Nudging through, he finds the object of their rapt attention.

           Mouser’s dead body. An ARROW protrudes from his rib-cage.

           Clinton freezes.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Mouser?

           He kneels by the body. He reaches out to touch Mouser, but 
           stops himself. Anguish settles over his face. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

           He looks up at the crowd.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Did anyone see what happened here?

           They all stare back at him, speechless.
                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        No one saw anything?!
                            (to Edie)
                        Ma? 

           She looks at him, despondent.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Get back. Everyone, just get away!

           The crowd backs up and begins to disperse.

           Clinton kneels in front of Mouser. He gently pets between his 
           ears.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                            (under his breath)
                        Mouser-boy?

                                 EDIE
                        I’m sorry, Clinton.

           Clinton glances at his mother fleetingly, torment in his 
           eyes, then picks up Mouser and cradles him against his chest.

           We CRANE UP, eventually looking down on him from a great 
           height.

           EXT. CLINTON’S HOUSE - MORNING - LATER

           A POLICE CRUISER is parked in front of the house.

           OFFICER HOYLE (40s), rugged with a slight paunch, jots notes 
           on a pad.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        So tell me about last night. What 
                        did you do, what did you see?

                                 CLINTON
                        Umm, let’s see. I watched four 
                        episodes of “Step By Step.” Maybe 
                        five. I ate my dinner. Macaroni and 
                        cheese. Kraft. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        You didn’t see or hear anything?

           Clinton shakes his head.
                                 OFFICER HOYLE (CONT’D)
                        Any enemies you know of or recent 
                        threats?

                                 CLINTON
                        No, no. Mouser was very well liked. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        I meant you.

                                 CLINTON
                        Oh. No. None whatsoever. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Do you know anyone who owns a bow 
                        and arrow?

           Clinton gives him a look. Seriously? He shakes his head no.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Thanks.

           Officer Hoyle closes his pad and turns to leave.

                                 CLINTON
                        Wait, that’s it?

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        No. I still have to file the 
                        report. Then we hope for the best.

                                 CLINTON
                        Hope for the best?

           Officer Hoyle nods.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        THERE’S AN ARROW STICKING OUT OF MY 
                        CAT!

           Officer Hoyle glances at Mouser, then back at Clinton.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        I’m sorry, sir.

                                 CLINTON
                        Aren’t you gonna take photos, get 
                        DNA samples?

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Alright, take it easy, bud.  
                                 CLINTON
                        No, I’m not gonna take it easy bud. 
                        My cat was clearly murdered. So I’m 
                        not gonna take it easy, BUD. 

           Officer Hoyle glares at him, shakes his head and walks away.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, sir. Can I have a few 
                        words for the Bethany Gazette? 

           Clinton turns to the young, overly made up REPORTER. She 
           holds a mini tape recorder. 

                                 CLINTON
                        What do you want?

                                 REPORTER
                        I’m doing a piece on this, is there 
                        anything you’d like to say?

           Clinton thinks for a moment, then takes the recorder from 
           her.

                                 CLINTON
                        My best friend was murdered today. 
                        And I demand justice. End quote.

           He spits on the ground and walks away.

           EXT. CLINTON’S HOUSE - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton trudges out of the house with a SHOEBOX in his arms.

           He kneels down and peers at Mouser plaintively.

           Clinton winces. He grips the arrow and carefully removes it.

           With a dustpan, Clinton gently scoops Mouser off the street 
           and into the shoebox. 

           He turns to see Officer Hoyle and his mother chatting by the 
           police cruiser. Officer Hoyle’s hand rests on Edie’s 
           shoulder.  

           Clinton scowls.

           INT. CLINTON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Edie walks down the steps and peers around. The room is 
           empty. She looks concerned.
           EXT. CLINTON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Edie walks outside.

                                 EDIE
                            (calling)
                        Clinton?

           She walks onto the lawn and looks up.

           Clinton sits Indian style on the roof, a candle by his side.

                                 EDIE (CONT’D)
                        Not this again. 
                            (calling)
                        Clinton, please come down from 
                        there.

                                 CLINTON
                        I’m having a vigil.

                                 EDIE
                        A vigil?

                                 CLINTON
                        Yes. A candlelight vigil. 

                                 EDIE
                        Can you have it inside, or at least 
                        from a safe height? 

           No answer. He lowers an EXTENSION CORD from the roof. 

                                 EDIE (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 CLINTON
                        Side socket, by the window.

           Edie sighs, then plugs it in.

                                 EDIE
                        Okay, will you come down now?

           Clinton pulls a small BOOMBOX from behind him and presses 
           play. “Amazing Grace” fills the air. He cranks up the volume.

                                 EDIE (CONT’D)
                        Clinton!

           WIDE ON STREET
           The lights in the houses flicker on as “Amazing Grace” blasts 
           through the neighborhood.  

           Dogs HOWL into the night.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

           A thick mist settles low in the sky.

           Clinton wanders down the barren street. 

           He peers around, puzzled.

           From OFF-SCREEN, the strained BREATHING of a man emerges.

           Clinton looks around, but the fog is too thick.

                                 CLINTON
                        Hello?

           He follows the breathing to find--

           Mouser lying in a puddle, the arrow jutting from his belly.

           Clinton stares at him in shock.

           Suddenly, Mouser turns to him and opens his mouth.

                                 MOUSER
                        Help me. 

           EXT. ROOF - MORNING

           Clinton awakens with a start.

           CLINTON’S POV: the neighborhood street, upsidedown.

           Clinton finds himself sprawled on the roof, his head dangling 
           over the gutter. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Oh god.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton walks in.

           Edie looks up from the newspaper.
                                 EDIE
                        Did you sleep on the roof again?

                                 CLINTON
                        What is that?

           Edie folds the paper. 

                                 EDIE
                        Nothing.

           Clinton grabs it. A small tussle ensues.

                                 CLINTON
                        What are you hiding?

                                 EDIE
                        Nothing. I just haven’t finished 
                        reading it.

           Clinton gives the paper a hard yank and wrestles it from her 
           hands. He peers at the article on the folded page. 

           ANGLE ON NEWSPAPER: “Suburban Cat Found Dead.”

           Clinton scans the page and finds a picture of himself waving 
           off the camera. 

                                 CLINTON
                        They called me an oddball?!

                                 EDIE
                        I think it’s meant to be endearing.

                                 CLINTON
                        He wasn’t just found dead, he was 
                        murdered. This is bullshit. Nobody 
                        cares.

                                 EDIE
                        Frank cares.

                                 CLINTON
                        Who the fuck is Frank?

                                 EDIE
                        Officer Hoyle.

                                 CLINTON 
                        You make me sick, you know that?

           Clinton tosses the paper to the ground.
           EXT. CLINTON’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton steps outside, a determined look on his face. He 
           walks to the edge of the driveway and stops. 

           Clinton scans the block pensively. Something’s rotten in the 
           town of Bethany. 

           Clinton leans over and picks up the “Moisey Emporium” sign.

           Out of the corner of his eye, Clinton notices Trevor peering 
           at him from across the street.

                                 CLINTON
                        Store’s closed. Indefinitely. I 
                        have other business to attend to. 

           Clinton tosses the sign across the yard.

           Trevor stays put.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        What do you want, kid? 

                                 TREVOR
                        Your cat, I saw him.

                                 CLINTON
                        What?

           Clinton marches over to Trevor.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        What do you know?

                                 TREVOR
                        Twenty.

                                 CLINTON
                            (intrigued)
                        Twenty? What is this twenty? Twenty 
                        what?

                                 TREVOR
                        Bucks. 

           Clinton shakes his head. 

                                 CLINTON
                        I’m not giving you twenty bucks, ya 
                        little weasel. 
           Trevor shrugs and begins to peddle away. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Okay, wait, wait!

           Clinton stuffs his hand in his pocket.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        All I got is ten.
                            (counts change)
                        Thirty-six. 

           Trevor snatches the money. 

                                 TREVOR
                        Follow me. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER

           Trevor peddles to a stop. Clinton jogs to catch up. 

                                 TREVOR
                        Here. 

                                 CLINTON
                            (catching his breath)
                        Here what? 

                                 TREVOR
                        I saw him. He dragged himself with 
                        the arrow sticking out of him and 
                        all. 

           He points to a DROP OF BLOOD on the pavement. 

           Clinton inspects the dried blood. He cringes. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Why didn’t you help him?

                                 TREVOR
                        I didn’t know what to do. You don’t 
                        see that every day. A cat with an 
                        arrow out of it. 

           Trevor begins to peddle off.

                                 CLINTON
                        Wait, where you going? 
                                 TREVOR
                        I gotta go to the pool with my 
                        brother. 

           Clinton shakes his head. 

           He peers at the pavement. 

           CLINTON’S POV: A few feet from the blood spot is another 
           spot. And another. A trail. 

           Clinton’s eyes light up. He follows it. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton closely follows the trail down the street. 

           He creeps along and suddenly stops in his tracks. 

           The trail has disappeared into wet asphalt, washed away by a 
           nearby sprinkler. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Shit.

           Clinton peers around. The sprinkler sits on the lawn of a 
           large APARTMENT COMPLEX. 

           He avoids the sprinkler and hops onto the curb. He furrows a 
           brow and thinks. He paces on the sidewalk and glances around.  

           A hot pink FLYER on a nearby telephone pole catches his eye. 
           Clinton approaches it.

           ANGLE ON FLYER: A gray tabby. White spots on the ears. A 
           matching white spot on the tail. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Mouser?

           He rips the flyer off the pole.

           ANGLE ON FLYER: The address reads “Hi, have you seen me? I 
           answer to Horatio. I live at 172 Hope’s Crossing, Apt. 21.”

           Clinton looks up at the apartment building, a large sign at 
           the entrance: “HOPE’S CROSSING. A 60+ Community.”

           Clinton raises an eyebrow. 
           INT. HOPE’S CROSSING RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER

           A sterile waiting area. Muzak plays too loudly over the 
           speakers. Stock paintings of landscapes and beach vistas.

           Clinton walks in and peers around. 

           On the wall an arrow marks rooms 10-31. Clinton heads for the 
           hallway.

           An octogenarian in a booth, PHYLLIS, takes notice.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Where do you think you’re going, 
                        mister?

           Clinton stops. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Umm, Apartment 21. 

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Who are you here to see? 

           Clinton hesitates. He glances at the flyer.

                                 CLINTON 
                        Horatio.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        There’s no Horatio here. What’s 
                        your name, sir? 

                                 CLINTON
                        Umm, Reilly. Doghouse Reilly.

           Phyllis peers at him coldly, then presses a button on the 
           desk. 

           An elderly man, ARTHUR, wearing only a European bathing suit 
           and Reebok cross trainers, swaggers from the pool area. His 
           aged skin is bronzed and his hair is badly dyed and slicked 
           back. He is the building’s self-appointed security guard. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey baby cute, this hepcat 
                        bothering you?
                            (to Clinton)
                        Beat it.

                                 CLINTON
                        Take it easy, gramps. 
                                 ARTHUR
                        Who you calling gramps, ivy leaguer 
                        pants? I will chase you down and 
                        box your ears. Try me. 

           Clinton peers at Arthur’s impressive sneakers, then back at 
           his sneering face. He takes off down the hall.

           Arthur gives chase. 

           Clinton ducks into the stairwell.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton treads down the hallway, peering around nervously. 

           He stops at Apartment 21. 

           He takes a deep breath and adjusts his collar, anxiously.

           He holds his fist in front of the door for a moment, then--

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. 

           Nothing. Silence. 

           He tries again, louder this time. KNOCK KNOCK--

           The door swings open a crack. 

           Surprised, he steps back from the door. He looks down the 
           hall, and hears Arthur approaching from around the corner. 

           Clinton looks back inside. Something catches his eye. 

           CLINTON’S POV: in the corner, a cat’s SCRATCHING POST. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Umm, hello? 

           He looks back down the hallway. Arthur rounds the bend. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Shit. 

           Clinton jumps inside. 
           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The place is a mess. A kaleidoscope tapestry hangs from the 
           ceiling. Various junk fills the space: a piece of painted 
           driftwood, an easel, a dusty gramophone.

           Clinton makes his way inside. 

           SQUEAK! Clinton jumps. He looks down to find a furry CAT TOY. 
           He inspects it with a scowl. Mouser’s. 

           Clinton finds traces of grey CAT HAIR on a recliner in the 
           corner. He rubs it through his fingers. 

           On the windowsill, cans of GOURMET CAT FOOD and a PLUSH CAT 
           BED.

           On the far wall, above an unmade bed, hangs a collage of 
           black and white pictures. 

           Clinton walks over to get a closer look. They are all 
           pictures of Mouser. A Shrine?

           Clinton grows pale. 

           Suddenly, FOOTSTEPS approach from the hallway. 

           Clinton panics. The footsteps close in. No time. 

           He scans the apartment. 

           A sliding SCREEN CLOSET in the corner. 

           Clinton dashes into the closet just as--

           A FEMALE FIGURE steps inside the door. 

           Inside the closet, Clinton struggles to see through the 
           screen.

           The Female Figure unloads some bags by the door. Wavy raven 
           hair flows over a worn leather jacket.

           After a moment, the Female Figure sheds the jacket and turns, 
           revealing herself as--

           An attractive woman in a gray tank top. Tattoos smatter her 
           arms and black hair dangles over pale blue eyes. A cigarette 
           juts from fire red lips. This is GRETA CHAPLINSKI, twenties.  

           She forcefully dabs out her cigarette and immediately sparks 
           another. She blows out a cumulonimbus cloud with a sigh. 
           She takes off her shirt, revealing a tattoo of tree extending 
           from her lower belly to her navel. She wears only a bra.

           Clinton bites his lip.

           Greta tosses the shirt aside and approaches the closet. 

           Panicked, Clinton attempts to hide behind some hanging 
           garments, causing a RUSTLE. 

           Greta freezes. She looks at the closet suspiciously.

                                 GRETA
                        Horatio?

           She opens the closet, revealing--

           Clinton, draped in her garments. Greta jumps back. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        AAAAAAAAH. HOLY HELL!!!

           Clinton holds up his hands in an attempt to appease her.

           Greta grabs a FLUTE from the dresser and brandishes it 
           menacingly.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        GET OUTTA OF MY HOUSE!!!

           Clinton raises his hands in surrender.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Who the FUCK are you?!

           Clinton struggles for words. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        The hell are you doing in my 
                        closet, you pervert?! Were you 
                        jerking off in there?

                                 CLINTON
                        No. No! God no!

           She grabs her phone.

                                 GRETA
                        I’m calling the police. Don’t even 
                        try to move, I will smash your 
                        balls with this flute.
                                 CLINTON
                        No, stop--I didn’t break in, the 
                        door was open, err, unlocked.

                                 GRETA
                        So you just prance right in, you 
                        deviant?

           She continues to dial.

                                 CLINTON
                        No no no. I’m not--It’s not--

           He reaches for the flyer in his back pocket.

           THWAP. She whacks him with the flute.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Aaahh! Fuck! 

           He drops the flyer. 

           Greta collects some broken flute pieces from the floor.

                                 GRETA
                        You broke my flute, asshole.

           She notices the flyer on the ground.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        What’s this? My flyer? 

           Clinton rubs his tender arm and glares at her.

                                 CLINTON
                        Yeah. And I want to know, why 
                        there’s a picture of my cat on it, 
                        not to mention all over your walls.

                                 GRETA
                        What?

                                 CLINTON
                        Skip it. I know what you did. Why 
                        don’t you throw a shirt on, cause 
                        I’m calling the police.

                                 GRETA
                            (indicating her phone)
                        No, I’m calling the police.

                                 CLINTON
                        No, I am. Give me that phone.
           Clinton reaches for it. She pulls away and readies the flute 
           again.

                                 GRETA
                            (into phone)
                        Yes, there is an intruder in my 
                        home, a sexual deviant. 

           Clinton glares at her.

                                 CLINTON
                        You’re gonna pay for this. 
                        You...pet hunter.

           He marches out. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Officer Hoyle monitors an elementary school crosswalk. He 
           blows a whistle at a young BOY crossing on yellow. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Hold it. You know better than that, 
                        Morgan.

           Clinton shoves the kids aside and runs the red light into 
           moving traffic.

           An SUV screeches to a stop.

                                 CLINTON
                        Hoyle!

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Clinton, what do you think you’re 
                        doing?!

                                 CLINTON
                        I found the killer!

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - LATER

           The cruiser is parked outside of Hope’s Crossing Retirement 
           Community.

           Officer Hoyle sits driver side. Clinton sits shotgun.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        You’re sure about this?
                                 CLINTON
                        Yes I’m sure. She attacked me with 
                        a lead pipe. Look.

           He demonstrates a small red mark on his arm.

           Officer Hoyle gives him a skeptical look.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Just let me do the talking.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton marches down the hallway. Officer Hoyle follows.

           Clinton stops at Greta’s apartment and rings the bell 
           repeatedly.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Okay, take it easy.

           After a moment, Greta opens the door. Upon seeing Officer 
           Hoyle, she sighs.

                                 GRETA
                        Finally, you’re here.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Excuse me?

           Greta spots Clinton. She looks at Officer Hoyle, confused.

                                 GRETA
                        Wait, that’s the guy!

                                 CLINTON
                        Quick, cuff her Hoyle. She’s 
                        dangerous.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Alright, what’s going on here?

                                 GRETA
                        This perv broke into my house, 
                        watched me change and masturbated 
                        on my clothes!

           Officer Hoyle turns to Clinton, wide-eyed.

                                 CLINTON
                        I was looking for evidence. There 
                        was no masturbating. 
                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        You broke into her apartment?

                                 CLINTON
                        No! The door was open. The 
                        important thing is, she’s a 
                        murderer. She killed Mouser! 

                                 GRETA
                        The hell are you talking about?! I 
                        didn’t kill any mice. 

           Clinton points to the “shrine” above her bed.

                                 CLINTON
                        The proof is on the walls! You 
                        lured Mouser here with your cheap 
                        bribes and fancy cat food, then ya 
                        pulled the trigger, err...the bow.

                                 GRETA
                        That’s Horatio! My cat!

           Officer Hoyle eyes the shrine.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Ma’am, is your cat here now?

                                 GRETA
                        He’s been gone for the past week. 
                        He disappears from time to time. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Bullshit! 

           Officer Hoyle thinks for a moment. He walks into the 
           apartment and removes a picture from the wall and studies it.   

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        I think I know what’s going on 
                        here. You two owned the same cat. 
                        He was moonlighting.

           Clinton pauses.

                                 CLINTON
                        Impossible. 

                                 GRETA
                        What do you mean owned? Past tense. 
                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        I’m sorry, ma’am, but Mouser, err, 
                        Horatio was found dead on Saturday.

           Greta stares at him in disbelief. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Cut the charade and show us the bow 
                        and arrow. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Shut up, Clinton.
                            (to Greta)
                        I’m sorry ma’am. I know this is a 
                        little awkward. But do you mind if 
                        I just take a quick look around the 
                        apartment?

           Still reeling, Greta steps aside and gestures for Officer 
           Hoyle to enter the apartment. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE (CONT’D)
                            (to Clinton)
                        You--wait in the car.

           Officer Hoyle steps inside. 

           Clinton gives her an accusatory look before marching off.

           EXT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY

           Officer Hoyle drives, silently. Clinton sits passenger.  

                                 CLINTON
                        --So you’re not gonna do anything 
                        then?! Not a damn thing?! How’d you 
                        even get that badge, man, you’re a 
                        quitter! 

           Officer Hoyle pulls to an abrupt stop in front of Clinton’s 
           house. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        First of all, there is not a shred 
                        of justifiable evidence linking 
                        that girl to this crime. And second 
                        of all, this is a POE-leece matter. 

           Officer Hoyle raises the badge on his chest pocket.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE (CONT’D)
                        For police officers. 
           He points demonstratively to the police insignia on his hat. 

                                 CLINTON
                        What’re you trying to tell me?

           Officer Hoyle sighs. He notices Edie on the lawn watering a 
           flower bed. He waves to her and smiles. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        I’m going to turn a blind eye to 
                        your breaking and entering. But you 
                        need to STOP. No more of your 
                        little detective game. It’s a cat 
                        we’re talking about here, not the 
                        Lindbergh baby. 

           Officer Hoyle reaches across Clinton and opens the door. 
           Clinton shakes his head and steps out. 

           EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING - NEXT DAY

           Clinton finishes digging a small hole underneath a tree. 

           He gently removes MOUSER’S BODY from the shoebox and puts it 
           in the hole.

           He gazes somberly at the body.

                                 GRETA (O.S.)
                        Hey asshole!

           Clinton jumps. He turns to find Greta marching toward him 
           from around the side of the house.

                                 CLINTON
                        What are you doing here? How’d you 
                        find my house?

                                 GRETA
                        I looked up fucko in the white 
                        pages.

           She quickly approaches him. Clinton raises his hands in 
           defense.

                                 CLINTON
                        Whoa, whoa. Don’t try anything, my 
                        mom’s in the house.

           Greta stops and sizes him up.
                                 GRETA
                        God, you’re a real pussy when you 
                        don’t have a cop to hide behind.

           Clinton glares at her.

                                 CLINTON
                        Why’d you do it?

                                 GRETA
                        Christ, would you stop with that? 
                        Just show me the cat.

                                 CLINTON
                        Not a chance. 

           Clinton spreads his arms, blocking her view of Mouser.

                                 GRETA
                        What are you hiding?

                                 CLINTON
                        Nothing. Get away!

           She pushes past Clinton to find Mouser’s lifeless body 
           nestled in the hole, almost as if he were sleeping.

           She gasps and covers her mouth with her hands.

           Her eyes well up.

           Clinton watches, confused.

                                 GRETA
                        Horatio.

           Anguish pours over her face. She bursts into overwhelming, 
           almost childlike tears.

           Without warning, she buries her face into Clinton’s chest and 
           wraps her arms around him.

           Clinton freezes up. He has no idea how to handle this.

           After a moment, she starts to pound on him with feeble 
           punches.

                                 CLINTON
                        Hey, hey, stop, what’s wrong with 
                        you?

           Clinton pulls away from her. She kneels down next to Mouser.
           She peers at the body for a long, somber moment. 

                                 GRETA
                        I don’t know what I’m gonna to do 
                        without him. It’s kinda sad, 
                        but...he was the best thing in my 
                        life.

           Clinton says nothing. But we know he feels the same.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Mouser, right?

           Clinton nods.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        This is nice. This burial here.

           Beat. Clinton peers at her for a moment.

                                 CLINTON
                        This was his favorite tree.

           Greta smiles faintly. She turns back to Mouser.

           She runs her fingers along the ARROW WOUND in his chest. She 
           looks at the BLOOD on her fingers.

                                 GRETA
                        How did this happen?

           INT. BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton rummages around in his closet.

           Greta peers around the room. She picks up a POLAROID of 
           Clinton, age 15, holding Mouser playfully. They both wear 
           sunglasses. 

           Greta smiles. She notices the multitude of action figures 
           lining his walls. She picks up homemade CAT ACTION FIGURE. 

                                 GRETA
                        Is this supposed to be Horatio? 
                            (plays with it)
                        His legs move and all. This is so 
                        cool, I love it!

           Clinton snatches it from her.
                                 CLINTON
                        It’s a work in progress, it’s part 
                        of my toy line. 

                                 GRETA
                        You have your own toy line?

                                 CLINTON
                        Let’s stay on task. 

           Clinton removes the arrow from a Ziploc bag. He carefully 
           hands it to her. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Be careful with this. 

           She takes it and inspects the fins. 

                                 GRETA
                        Bite marks.
                            (she thinks, then sadly)
                        He was trying to pull it out. 

           Clinton nods. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Who would do this?

                                 CLINTON
                        Well, now that you’re off my list, 
                        my other theories are: LARPer or 
                        Indian. 

           Greta gives him a look. She thinks.

                                 GRETA
                        They sell these at Ford’s.

                                 CLINTON
                            (disgusted)
                        Ford’s Megastore?

                                 GRETA
                        Yeah. I used to be assistant 
                        manager there. They have a whole 
                        weapon’s section.

           Clinton shudders. He gazes into the distance.

                                 CLINTON
                        I thought I’d never have to set 
                        foot in that place.

                                 CLINTON (CONT'D)
                            (then, heroically)
                        Let’s roll.

           INT. GRETA’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           A rusty orange ‘83 Volkswagon Rabbit. Beaded necklaces hang 
           around the rearview above a bobble-head Buddha. 

           Greta drives fast and loose. Clinton grips his seat.

                                 CLINTON
                        Is this thing road safe? 

                                 GRETA
                        Harvey? Of course. He’s a beast. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Harvey? 

                                 GRETA
                        Harvey Keitel. He’s a VW rabbit. So 
                        first I called him Harvey, like the 
                        Jimmy Stewart movie. But he’s also 
                        a badass, like Keitel. So there you 
                        have it, Harvey Keitel. 

           She pats her steering wheel lovingly.

                                 CLINTON
                        Doesn’t make sense.

                                 GRETA
                        What doesn’t make sense?

                                 CLINTON
                        The Keitel trumps the Harvey. The 
                        Jimmy Stewart reference is totally 
                        lost with the “Keitel.” I mean, why 
                        don’t you just call him Harvey 
                        Pacino?

                                 GRETA
                        Cause I don’t like Pacino. And 
                        because his name is Harvey Keitel. 
                        By the way, it’s Greta.

                                 CLINTON
                        What, the dashboard?

                                 GRETA
                        No, me, idiot.

           Clinton stares out the window, unresponsive.
                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        This is where you give me your 
                        name.

                                 CLINTON
                            (squeamish)
                        Clinton.

           She speeds through a yellow light. Clinton holds on for dear 
           life.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        You almost hit that school bus.

                                 GRETA
                        So you live with your mom?

           Clinton nods.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        God, that’s brutal. If I had to 
                        live with my parents I’d kill 
                        myself. And them.

                                 CLINTON
                        It’s a business choice. I run a 
                        small enterprise out of the home. 
                        You’re one to talk, living with a 
                        bunch of geriatrics.

                                 GRETA
                        Phyllis gives me a good deal in 
                        exchange for cutting everyone’s 
                        hair. Plus the elderly are quiet, 
                        peaceful, full of stories. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Old people remind me of death. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING

           A tall imposing sign reads, FORD’S MEGASTORE, in bold capital 
           letters. 

           Greta and Clinton cross the vast parking lot and head for the 
           entrance, a garish store front. 

           They pause at the entrance. The automated doors part. 
           Clinton looks up to see a motto emblazoned above the 
           entrance: “You steal from us.” He peers inside the open 
           doors: blinding fluorescent lights, boundless aisles of 
           wholesale goods, families pushing carts like drones. 

           A cardboard cut-out of owner Al Ford smiling and waving. 

           Clinton shudders. He turns to Greta, who appears uneasy. She 
           sucks on a cigarette, anxiously.  

                                 CLINTON
                        What’s your deal? 

                                 GRETA
                        It’s nothing, I just haven’t been 
                        here since I quit.

           She tosses the cigarette to the ground and stamps it out.  

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Come on. 

           Greta steps through the doors. Clinton follows. 

           INT. FORD’S MEGASTORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Walking down the long aisle, Clinton spots the TOY SECTION 
           and enters. 

           Rows of franchise toys: Lego, GI JOE, Transformers, etc. He 
           grabs a box.  

                                 CLINTON
                        Soulless crap.

           He tosses it.

           INT. FORD’S MEGASTORE - SPORTING SECTION - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton catches up with Greta at the weapons corner. Rows of 
           glass encased rifles, handguns, and hunting knives. 

           From behind the counter, a striking half-Asian employee with 
           long flowing hair whittles a WOODEN UNICORN with a Bowie 
           Knife. This is YI KIM (19). He looks up at Greta. 

                                 YI KIM
                        Greta Chaplinski. Back from 
                        retirement. Am I that irresistible?
                                 GRETA
                        Eat my balls, Yi.

           Clinton removes the ARROW from his back pocket.

                                 CLINTON
                        You know where this came from?

           Yi glances up from his whittling.

                                 YI KIM
                        Can’t you see I’m on break?

           Yi gently hands Greta the unicorn and walks off. 

           The WEAPONS SALESMAN, a squat mustached man wearing a 
           collared shirt and red vest, emerges from a back room. 

                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN
                        Howdy, how can I help you two?

           Clinton gestures to the arrow.

                                 CLINTON
                        Where did this arrow come from?

           Clinton lays the arrow on the glass counter. 

                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN
                        Well, that is not an arrow. That is 
                        a bolt. 

                                 GRETA
                        A bolt?

                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN
                        Yes, a bolt. For a crossbow. Looks 
                        like an arrow, but it’s 
                        significantly heavier and has 
                        vastly different flight 
                        characteristics. This one in 
                        particular belongs to the Sure Shot 
                        5000 series. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Show it to me. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           The Weapons Salesman places the Sure Shot 5000 CROSSBOW on 
           the table. 
                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN
                        It’s a quality crossbow. 
                        Manufactured in China. Zhengzhou I 
                        believe. 

           He compares the bolts. An exact match. 

                                 GRETA
                        Is this a popular model?

                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN
                        Actually, Sure Shot is a fledgling 
                        company. We’re the only ones in the 
                        country to carry it. 

           The Weapons Salesman picks up the crossbow and looks through 
           the cross hairs. 

                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        She’s a real beaut though. A fine 
                        weapon. Look at the craftsmanship 
                        on this thing: titanium barrel, 
                        nickle inlay. She’s a true shot and 
                        packs a real wallop. You could take 
                        down a rabbit at full stride from 
                        100 feet--

                                 CLINTON
                        --My cat was murdered with that 
                        thing.

           The Weapons Salesman registers shock and gently places the 
           crossbow on the counter. 

                                 GRETA
                        My cat too. 

                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN
                        Two cats?

                                 GRETA
                        No, one cat. Two owners.

           CRASH! Clinton knocks the crossbow to the floor. 

                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN
                        Sir?

                                 CLINTON
                        Who’d you sell it to!

                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN
                        Excuse me?
                                 CLINTON
                        You heard me. Who’d you sell the 
                        murder weapon to?...Deathmaster!

           The Weapons Salesman looks around uneasily.

                                 GRETA
                        Clinton!

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        What’s going on here?

           Clinton and Greta turn to see--

           A tall fit man (50s) approaches. He has thinning, well-
           groomed hair. This is none other than ALISTAIR FORD.

                                 FORD
                            (stiff)
                        Greta?

           Greta forces a thin smile. Clinton glares at him.

                                 CLINTON
                        You’re--

                                 FORD
                        --from the commercial. Yes, I’m Al 
                        Ford.

           He extends his hand to Clinton. Clinton ignores it.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        So...What’s the problem here?

                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN
                        He called me deathmaster.

                                 FORD
                        Deathmaster? What is this 
                        “deathmaster?”

           Clinton peers at Ford with cold, unblinking eyes.

                                 CLINTON
                        Your crossbow killed my best 
                        friend. 

                                 FORD
                        My god.

                                 WEAPONS SALESMAN
                        He means his cat.
           Ford assumes a grave air.

                                 FORD
                        Oh. I think I saw that in the 
                        Gazette. I am so sorry. Truly. It 
                        kills me to think that someone 
                        would use a product of mine in that 
                        way. If there is anything I can do 
                        to help, anything at all, please, 
                        don’t hesitate to ask.

                                 CLINTON
                        I want the names of everyone who 
                        bought this damn thing.

                                 FORD
                        That I can’t do.

                                 CLINTON
                        You shit-faced phony.

                                 GRETA
                        Godamnit Clinton!

           Ford’s face reddens, he takes a step toward Clinton.

                                 FORD
                        What did you just call me?

           Greta steps in between them.

                                 GRETA
                        Listen, we just want to take a 
                        quick look at the sales inventory 
                        so we know the people who bought 
                        this thing, then we’ll get out of 
                        here.

                                 FORD
                        Ms. Chaplinski, as you well know, 
                        what you’re asking is strictly 
                        against store policy. Now I might 
                        have considered bending the rules a 
                        bit. But quitting without notice, 
                        leaving everyone completely 
                        stranded, not returning your vest--
                        all of this demonstrates blatant 
                        disregard for this establishment. 

           Greta glares at him for a pregnant moment, then sighs.

                                 GRETA
                        I’m outta here.
           Greta walks away.

           Clinton throws his arms in the air.

                                 CLINTON
                        Wait, where are you going?

           She walks off without answering. Clinton turns to Ford.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Just show me the goddamn inventory, 
                        Ford.

                                 FORD
                        Can’t do that.

           Clinton glares at him.

                                 CLINTON
                        You really are a sham.

                                 FORD
                        Get out of my store.

           Ford motions to some security guards.

                                 CLINTON
                        Alright, you want to play hardball?

           EXT. FORD’S MEGASTORE - AFTERNOON

           A drum BEAT sounds from somewhere unseen. 

           Clinton plasters a large BANNER on the wall of the Megastore, 
           next to the entrance. 

           ANGLE ON POSTER: Styled like Soviet Agitprop, FORD looms over 
           the slain body of Mouser. Across the body it reads, “To the 
           living we owe respect, but to the dead we owe only the 
           truth.’ - VOLTAIRE.”

           A sizeable crowd has formed. A concerned middle-aged WOMAN 
           approaches Clinton.

                                 WOMAN
                        What is this all about? What are 
                        you protesting?

                                 CLINTON
                        Isn’t it obvious? Ford’s. This 
                        store puts innocent lives at risk.
           She looks up.

                                 WOMAN
                        Oh my god! 

           We TILT up to reveal Trevor, Clinton’s kid neighbor, 
           perilously perched atop the giant “F” of “Ford’s Megastore” 
           sign. He pounds on a bongo drum.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        He’s just a boy!

                                 CLINTON
                        Exactly. And a very noble one. He’s 
                        fasting in protest. 

                                 TREVOR 
                            (shouting)
                        This is gay, let me down!

                                 CLINTON
                        You want your five bucks or not?! 
                        Keep drumming!

           The crowd murmurs and boos. 

           WHOOP WHOOP. Two police cruisers creep into the parking lot. 

           Ford emerges from the building and peers at the scene. He 
           approaches Officer Hoyle, who stands beside the police 
           cruiser.

           They converse for a moment, then Ford walks over to Clinton.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Hear that? They’re booing you Ford. 
                        You’re finished.

                                 FORD
                        They’re booing you, you 
                        idiot!..Look, I’ve asked the police 
                        not to interfere. But you need to 
                        stop this. Now. You’re completely 
                        out of line.

                                 CLINTON
                        What’s out of line is your store, 
                        your products, and everything you 
                        stand for.

           Ford sighs and rubs his eyes. 
                                 FORD
                        Okay, listen kid. I’m a business 
                        owner. Among other things, I sell 
                        sporting goods, some of which, are 
                        weapons. I’m no maverick here. 
                        There are similar stores all over 
                        the country. I’m very sorry about 
                        your cat. But, frankly, it’s not my 
                        problem. If you choke on a 
                        McNugget, do you blame McDonalds?

                                 CLINTON
                        Perhaps. 

           Ford curses under his breath.

                                 FORD
                        Look, you pinhead, this whole 
                        charade you’re putting on is 
                        pointless. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Oh yeah? We’ll see.

                                 FORD
                        No, we won’t see, goddamnit. The 
                        Sure Shot 5000 is a bust, okay? You 
                        want the inventory info, I’ll tell 
                        you: no models have been sold. Get 
                        it? It didn’t come from my store. 
                        Now quit making a fool of yourself 
                        and get out of here before I change 
                        my mind about pressing charges.

           Clinton glares at Ford, at a loss for words.

                                 CLINTON
                        That’s impossible.

                                 FORD
                        It’s fact.

           Ford marches off.

           Clinton just stands there, perplexed. 

           INT. GRETA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Swinging jazz fills the room.
           Arthur, the elderly security guard, reclines in the “barber’s 
           chair”. Greta runs a comb through his freshly dyed jet black 
           Greaser cut. 

           He admires his reflection in the mirror. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        That’s fine work there, dolly. Fine 
                        work.

                                 GRETA
                        Yeah? I’m glad you like it, Arth. 

           He holds up his hand.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Please, call me Ramrod. 

           Arthur picks up a skinny joint from the table, he puffs it.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Haven’t had tea this good since the 
                        summer of ‘58. 
                            (nostalgic)
                        I had me some good dolly pussy back 
                        then. 

           Greta lets out an amused chuckle. 

           WHAP. The door swings open. Clinton barges in.

                                 CLINTON
                        Greta, we need to talk. 

                                 GRETA
                            (sarcastic)
                        Um, hello Clinton. Come on in why 
                        don’t you. Make yourself at home.

                                 CLINTON
                        It’s about the crossbows. We’ve hit 
                        a wall. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Greta, you’re friends with this 
                        Clyde?

                                 GRETA
                        I’m sorry Arthur, can you excuse me 
                        for a second?

           Arthur takes another puff of the joint. 
                                 ARTHUR
                        I have no idea what you’re saying 
                        to me. This tea’s got me on another 
                        planet. I’ll catch you on the 
                        flipside, babe.

           He swaggers out the door. 

                                 CLINTON
                        You’re selling pot to old people?

                                 GRETA
                        Dried paprika. Arthur can’t handle 
                        his weed--What the hell is going 
                        on? 

           Clinton scans the hair cutting booth. Something dawns on him.

                                 CLINTON
                        Were you cutting Mouser’s hair?

                                 GRETA
                        Yeah, of course. I needed the 
                        practice, and his hair was a mess.

                                 CLINTON
                        What?! His hair was untamed and 
                        beautiful!

                                 GRETA
                        I think it was my best work. 
                            (beat)
                        Why are you all sweaty?

                                 CLINTON
                        I broke Ford. He claims no 
                        crossbows were sold, but it doesn’t 
                        add up. 

           Greta raises an eyebrow. 

                                 GRETA
                        Really? None? Well, I don’t know 
                        then. Maybe it came from Zhengzing 
                        or whatever.

                                 CLINTON
                        Or maybe Ford is lying. The 
                        crossbow had to come from his 
                        store. But this thing is a 
                        publicity nightmare for him. Mr. 
                        Family values is trying to protect 
                        his image. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLINTON (CONT'D)
                        Something is definitely going on.
                            (beat)
                        And I’m gonna find out what. 

           Greta hesitates.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        You with me?

                                 GRETA
                        I don’t know, Clinton. 

                                 CLINTON
                        What the hell is going on with you? 
                        You ditch me at Ford’s, and now 
                        you’re just giving up? I need your 
                        help.

           Greta looks conflicted. 

                                 GRETA
                        I’m not giving up. But, the police, 
                        Ford’s, it’s too much. It’s not 
                        worth it. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Too much? Are you not hearing me? 
                        Ford’s full of shit. Their crossbow 
                        killed Mouser, Horatio - OUR CAT! 
                        These are the same scumbags who ran 
                        my store out of business. They 
                        think they can just push around the 
                        little guy. Well this time the 
                        little guy is pushing back! Are you 
                        with me?

           Greta checks her watch.

                                 GRETA
                        Are we done? Cause, I have another 
                        customer coming. 

           Clinton glares at her. He’s obviously disappointed. 

           He turns for the door, then stops. He removes the MOUSER 
           ACTION FIGURE from his pocket and places it on a bookshelf.

                                 CLINTON
                        I finished it. 

           He marches out of the room and closes the door.
           Greta walks over to the bookshelf and picks up the Mouser 
           Action Figure. She runs her finger along the nape of its neck 
           and smiles wistfully.  

           INT. CLINTON’S HOUSE - ATTIC - MORNING

           Clinton, frustrated, rummages through musty old boxes. He 
           tosses them around carelessly.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Edie walks into the hallway and spots the ceiling ladder 
           leading up to the attic.

           CRASH. THUD. An old lamp falls with a SMASH. She shakes her 
           head.

                                 EDIE
                        What in god’s name are you doing up 
                        there?

                                 CLINTON (O.S.)
                        Where are grandpa’s binoculars?

                                 EDIE 
                        Why do you want those?

                                 CLINTON (O.S.)
                        I need them for something. Christ, 
                        don’t you ever clean this place?!

           INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

           Clinton pops open a dusty wood chest. He removes antique 
           brass BINOCULARS. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Jackpot.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Clinton scales the ladder, the binoculars in hand.

                                 EDIE
                        Clinton, that is an heirloom. From 
                        Vienna. They’re opera glasses. 

                                 CLINTON
                        They magnify don’t they?
                                 EDIE
                        Over my dead grave you’re taking 
                        those. 

                                 CLINTON
                        It’s happening.

                                 EDIE
                        Clinton!

           Clinton marches out of the room.

           BASEMENT

           Edie follows Clinton down the stairs.

                                 EDIE (CONT’D)
                        What is going on with you? You 
                        haven’t been home, you’re acting 
                        like some kind of frazzled stock 
                        broker!

                                 CLINTON
                        Big things are happening mom. I 
                        can’t get into it, but it’s a game 
                        changer.

                                 EDIE
                        What does that even mean? I’m 
                        calling Dr. Kulu.

                                 CLINTON
                        He’s a vet mom. He’s of no use to 
                        us now.
                            (beat)
                        By the way, I’m gonna need a ride 
                        to Ford’s.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Clinton holds a cheap plastic razor and stares pensively at 
           his stubble in the mirror. 

           INT. BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton, now with a budding mustache, lays a cheap black suit 
           on his bed. 

           Clinton buttons up a white shirt. He slips on a skinny tie. 
           He throws on an old blazer. Threadbare. Too tight.  
           He looks contemplatively at the mirror. Stoic. Knightly.

                                 CLINTON
                            (whisper)
                        Reilly. Doghouse Reilly.

           EXT. BUSHES - MORNING

           BINOCULAR POV: Ford’s Megastore Warehouse. 

           Clinton lays prostrate on the crest of grassy knoll. He peers 
           through the opera binoculars. 

           He checks his watch, then reaches for a bag of Fritos. 

           Clinton suddenly perks up. He looks through the binoculars. 

           BINOCULAR POV: Ford exits from the warehouse, talking on his 
           cell phone. He gets into his baby blue Mercedes Benz and 
           drives off. 

           Clinton hops up. This is his chance. He opens a beat-up 
           briefcase to reveal a Ford’s Megastore employee VEST, with 
           the nametag, “Greta”.

           EXT. FORD’S MEGASTORE - WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton, the vest over his shirt and tie, approaches the 
           entrance. 

           He makes a wide berth around the warehouse FOREMAN.

                                 FOREMAN
                        The hell do you think you’re doing?

           Clinton slows to a stop. He nervously turns to the Foreman. 

                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                        Who are you? 

                                 CLINTON
                        Me? I’m, uh, Greta. Greta 
                        Johnno...Dan...Nathan...Linden... 
                        Burger.

           The foreman looks him over.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Ah, a fellow Jew. Go on in, khaver. 

           Unsure of what to do, Clinton bows awkwardly then walks in.
           INT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton steps into the warehouse. A vast space. Rows upon 
           rows of boxes. 

           He rolls up his sleeves and marches forth. 

           MONTAGE: The Search

           1. Clinton browses aisle after aisle of boxes. No dice.

           2. Clinton types “Sure Shot 5000” into an employee computer 
           station. An error message: ACCESS DENIED. 

           3. Clinton shows a METALHEAD Stockboy a crude drawing of a 
           crossbow. The stockboy shrugs. 

           4. Smoking break outside. A few employees lean against the 
           wall. Clinton talks to an ELDERLY EMPLOYEE.

                                 CLINTON
                        I know brother. Another day another 
                        dollar. But we gotta keep our nose 
                        to the grindstone so to speak. 

           The Elderly Employee nods vaguely. Clinton inhales the 
           cigarette and coughs violently. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        So where do we keep those, uh, Sure 
                        Shot 5000 Crossbows everyone’s 
                        talking about?

                                 ELDERLY EMPLOYEE
                        Everyone’s talking about ‘em? I 
                        dunno, check weapons, Row G-12. 

           Clinton nods and mouths “G-12.”

           INT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Row G-12. Clinton make his way to a sign that reads Sure Shot 

           The shelf is empty. Not a single box. 

           He checks the boxes in the surrounding area. No crossbows. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Fuck. 
           Clinton scratches his head in frustration. 

                                 FORD (O.S.)
                        Yi, come here!

           Clinton panics at the sound of Ford’s voice. He looks around 
           for an escape. 

           He dashes to a shadowy corner and ducks behind a stack of 
           boxes. He peers out. 

           A few yards away, Yi smokes a cigarette next to a hulking 
           linebacker type, DAVE CALVETTI (19). 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        What did I tell you about smoking 
                        in the warehouse? Put it out. 
                        What’s wrong with you?

           Yi gives a subtle, unblinking nod, then allows the cigarette 
           to limply fall from his lips. He produces a fresh cigarette 
           from his ear and places it in his mouth. 

           Ford looks confused.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 YI KIM
                        Not smoking.

           With his index finger he pushes it into his mouth. Then he 
           opens wide. No cigarette. 

           He points at Ford’s ear.

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, what’s that there? 

           With a magician’s flourish, he pulls the cigarette from 
           behind Ford’s ear.

                                 FORD
                        Okay, Yi, this is ridiculous. 

                                 YI KIM
                        I’m sorry, sir, you’re right. But 
                        isn’t there something you wanted to 
                        give me? From your pocket? 

           Confused, Ford reluctantly reaches into this pocket. He 
           removes yet another cigarette.
           Ford tosses the cigarette to the ground, glares at Yi, then 
           storms off.

           Yi picks up the cigarette, lights it, and inhales pensively. 

           Dave chuckles. Yi places a finger on Dave’s lips.

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        Mute.
                            (very serious)
                        We have to get these boxes to our 
                        man by four sharp. So no ice cream 
                        breaks. And, Dave? If you get a 
                        flat tire this time, do not call 
                        the police. Do you understand me?

           Dave looks down guiltily, like a wounded child.

           Yi places two fingers under his chin and raises it.

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        Chin up, Tenderfoot. I still have 
                        faith in you.

           Yi walks off. Dave proceeds to pile boxes onto a pushcart.

           Clinton peers at the boxes curiously. He raises the 
           binoculars to his eyes.

           CLINTON’S POV: The label on the box: “Sure Shot 5000.”

           Clinton’s eyes light up.

           Dave stacks the final box and pushes the cart down the aisle. 

           Clinton covertly follows.

           EXT. PARKING LOT  - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave stacks the Sure Shot boxes into a WHITE VAN. 

           Clinton watches from behind a dumpster. 

           Suddenly distracted, Dave walks off. 

           This is Clinton’s chance. He looks around, then makes a dash 
           for the van.  

           VAN

           Clinton peers inside. The boxes are stacked high. 
           In the back, Clinton spots SURE SHOT 5000 CROSSBOWS scattered 
           about. 

           Clinton grows pale. 

           He grabs a box and fumbles with the seal. He tears it open to 
           find--

           STACKED LAPTOPS, sealed in bubble wrap.

           Clinton furls brow. Huh?

           A SOUND in the distance. Clinton turns.

           Dave, ice cream cone in hand, stares at Clinton. He drops the 
           cone and gives chase. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Oh god. 

           Frantic, Clinton grabs the box and makes a run for it across 
           the parking lot.

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           1. Clinton sprints down a suburban street. Like a Leviathan, 
           Dave keeps a steady pace. 

           2. Clinton runs beside a pickup truck, wildly gesturing for 
           help. The DRIVER gives him a skittish look and drives off. 

           3. Clinton weaves through a street hockey game. Dave body 
           checks a roller blader.

           4. Clinton cuts through a backyard, Dave follows close 
           behind. Clinton tosses the box into an in-ground pool and 
           hops a picket fence. 

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Panic-stricken, Clinton stumbles down the sidewalk.

           Dave follows in the distance.

           Clinton approaches an IRISH PUB - MCGILLICUTTY’S. Something 
           catches his eye--

           Greta’s VW RABBIT double-parked in the pub lot.

                                 CLINTON
                        Greta.
           Clinton veers toward the pub.

           He scrambles to the door and takes one last look behind him. 
           No Dave. Clinton goes inside.

           INT. MCGILLICUTTY’S - CONTINUOUS

           A smoky, oak speakeasy. 

           Happy hour. A small crowd of no-nonsense regulars. Drinkers. 

           The ‘84 World Series plays on a small TV. 

           Clinton, sweaty and out of breath, stumbles in and peers 
           around. 

           The regulars stop momentarily and gaze at him. Greta is 
           nowhere to be found. 

           Clinton sniffs the air, then heads for the bathroom. 

           BACK AREA

           Outside of the bathroom, Greta leans against the wall and 
           puffs on a JOINT. 

           A thin college professor type, HOWARD, peers at a bag of weed 
           through thick glasses. 

                                 HOWARD
                        --Cause, you know, I prefer the 
                        sativa. The Hemp Star you gave me 
                        was just too soporific. It needs 
                        to be more lively, abstract, but 
                        not cloudy. 

           Greta passes the joint to him. 

                                 GRETA
                        Look, Howie, admit it, you teach 
                        high. I know.

           Howard chuckles, embarrassed. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Just try it. It’s a complete head 
                        high. You’ll be thinking on at 
                        least 9 levels while lecturing. 
                        Forget linear algebra, you’ll be 
                        solving the riddles of the 
                        universe. Course, if you don’t like 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        it, just bring it back, I’ll give 
                        you something you will. 

           Clinton emerges. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Greta!

                                 GRETA
                        Whoa, Clinton, holy shit, what 
                        happened to you? 
                            (beat)
                        Nice ‘stache, Alex Trebek. 

           Clinton is too winded to respond. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Greta, I should, yeah, I’m gonna... 
                        This looks great. 

           Howard slips her a wad of bills and ducks out. 

           Clinton leans against the wall. He talks in short, panicked 
           bursts.

                                 CLINTON
                        I was just chased. All the way 
                        here. He was...like a machine. A 
                        running machine. 

           Greta lays a comforting hand on his shoulder. 

                                 GRETA
                        Shhh, Clinton, calm down.
                        Breathe. Just take a second and 
                        catch your breath. 

           Clinton hunches over, hands on knees, and wheezes heavily. 
           Greta rubs his back, almost maternally. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, relax. You’re gonna be 
                        okay.

           Clinton’s breathing slows.

           She helps him up. Clinton lays his back against the wall, 
           panting. He notices her hand on his shoulder.

           He flushes over. Suddenly he feels very awkward.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        I have something that’ll help.
           She leans in. They lock eyes.

           She purses her lips.

           Time stands still. Clinton tries to say something, but 
           nothing comes out.

           She closes her eyes and opens her mouth. This is happening.

           Clinton closes his eyes. He puckers. His lips quiver.

           Inches from his face, Greta exhales pot smoke into Clinton’s 
           lungs.

           He opens his eyes and gasps. 

           He collapses into a coughing fit. 

                                 CLINTON
                            (between coughs)
                        Good god, what is this?

                                 GRETA
                        Trust me. It’ll help. 

           INT. MCGILLICUTTY’S - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton slouches in a booth staring with fascination at the 
           baseball game on TV. His eyes are red, welled with tears.

           Greta places two PINTS on the table and slides into the seat 
           across from him.

           A solitary tear trickles down Clinton’s cheek.

                                 GRETA
                        Jesus, are you okay?

                                 CLINTON
                            (broken up)
                        They just pulled him right off the 
                        mound. Look at him. Did they even 
                        think how he might feel? I mean, he 
                        walked one guy. One guy. And just 
                        like that they pull you? Such a 
                        cruel game. In a cruel world. 

                                 GRETA
                        Clinton, what the hell happened to 
                        you?
           Clinton snaps to. He rubs his eyes, then proceeds to explain 
           with a stoner’s philosophical gravity.

                                 CLINTON
                        I broke into the Ford’s warehouse.

                                 GRETA
                        You what?

                                 CLINTON
                        Yeah. Crawled in through a 
                        ventilation shaft. Very dangerous. 
                        I was like some kind of clever 
                        mongoose. 

           Greta just looks at him. Clinton leans forward.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Listen, it’s deeper than I thought. 
                        The Sure Shots, Ford’s, it’s all 
                        connected. That’s obvious. But, I 
                        mean, there’s something bigger 
                        going on, some kind of theft ring.   

           She leans back in her chair, taking it in.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        That guy, Kimchi--

                                 GRETA
                        --Kimchi, um, Yi Kim?

                                 CLINTON
                        Yeah, him, there’s something off 
                        about him.

                                 GRETA
                        To say the least. 

                                 CLINTON
                        What does that mean?

                                 GRETA
                        He’s weird. Like, maybe the 
                        weirdest person I know.

                                 CLINTON
                        Whoa, whoa. I’m weird. I’m a 
                        friggin’ weirdo. 

                                 GRETA
                        You’re minor league weird. I’m 
                        talking hall of fame weird. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRETA (CONT'D)
                        Like, if Prince and Pee Wee Herman 
                        had a baby, it wouldn’t play with 
                        Yi Kim.

                                 CLINTON
                        Whatever. The point is, Liu Kang 
                        and his Sasquatch buddy are 
                        stealing from the store. They’re 
                        using the unsold crossbow boxes as 
                        a cover somehow. They’re boosters, 
                        dropping off the stolen goods to a 
                        fence. I’ve read all about this in 
                        a Hardy Boys book. I’m not sure how 
                        it’s connected to Mouser yet, but 
                        these guys are the only ones to 
                        have access to the crossbows. 

           Greta looks pale.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        What? What is it?

                                 GRETA
                        Nothing. 

                                 CLINTON
                        That is not nothing. You’re all 
                        tense. And you’ve torn that coaster 
                        to shreds.

           ANGLE ON: Greta’s coaster is ripped into bits and rests in a 
           small mound. 

           She quickly wipes the shreds off the table.

                                 GRETA
                        You’re just high, Clinton. 

           Clinton studies her for a moment. She averts his gaze.

                                 CLINTON
                        You knew about this. 

           She shakes her head no. Clinton narrows his eyes.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        That’s why you quit. And why you’re 
                        acting all weird. 

                                 GRETA
                        Clinton, seriously, you don’t know 
                        what you’re talking about. 
                                 BARTENDER (O.S.)
                        Two Glenlivets. Neat. 

           A matronly Irish BARTENDER places two shots on the table.

                                 CLINTON
                        What’s this? Look, we’re trying to 
                        have a conversation here.

                                 BARTENDER
                            (miffed)
                        Simmer down honey. They’re courtesy 
                        of the gentleman over there.

           She points across the bar to--

           YI KIM, leaning against the Juke Box. He wears black pleated 
           pants and a partially unbuttoned collared shirt.

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           A QUARTER drops into the slot.

           A RECORD unhinges and lowers onto the turntable.

           The NEEDLE lowers. STATIC, then--

           “Big Girls Don’t Cry” by the Four Seasons fills the air. 

           Clinton’s face grows pale. He looks over his shoulder--

           Dave stands arms akimbo by the exit.  

           Clinton freezes. They’re trapped.

           Yi Kim saunters over, a slight rhythm in his step. He carries 
           his own whiskey shot.

           He stops in front of the table and peers down at them, his 
           long hair flowing over his eyes. 

           Clinton stares at the table like a scared child.

           Yi Kim sips the shot, swirls it around his mouth, savoring 
           the taste, then downs the rest.

           He slips into the seat next to Greta and puts his arm over 
           her shoulder.

                                 YI KIM
                        Gretabear, aren’t you gonna drink 
                        your shot? It’s Glenlivet, your 
                        favorite.
           Clinton looks up at Greta, confused. What’s going on here?

           Yi Kim offers Clinton his hand.

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think we’ve met. Yi Kim.

           Clinton cautiously shakes his hand. 

           Dave slides in next to Clinton. 

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        This is Dave Calvetti. I didn’t get 
                        your name.

                                 CLINTON
                            (mumbles)
                        Clinton.

                                 YI KIM
                        Your shot is collecting dust.

                                 CLINTON
                        I don’t really--

                                 YI KIM
                        --Drink it.

           Clinton reluctantly takes it down.

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        Let’s take a walk. The varnish in 
                        this place smells like sadness.

           Dave lays a meaty hand on Clinton’s neck. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Yi leads the foursome to the edge of the parking lot.

                                 GRETA
                        Yi, where the hell are we going?

           Yi wraps his arm around Greta’s shoulder.

                                 YI KIM
                        We’re going on a little trip, 
                        Gretabear. It’ll be fun.
                            (gives her a wink)
                        Like old times.
           Clinton looks over his shoulder nervously, but Dave gives him 
           a shove to keep moving. 

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           They make their way through the patch of woods.

           Yi Kim checks his watch, then picks up his pace.

                                 YI KIM
                        We miss you at the store. What are 
                        you up to these days? Still dealing 
                        to oddballs and the elderly?

                                 GRETA
                        That’s right. Which one does that 
                        make you, Yi?

           Yi Kim smiles thinly.

                                 YI KIM
                        Oddball of course. 

           He turns to Clinton.

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        So Clinton, you like Greta, huh?

           Clinton looks to Greta. They share an uneasy look. 

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        Don’t talk much, do you? You must 
                        be complicated. We all know how 
                        Greta loves a challenge.

           Greta shrugs Yi’s arm off her shoulder. 

                                 GRETA
                        Alright, what the fuck, Yi?! What’s 
                        going on here? 

                                 YI KIM
                        Whoa, take it easy. You’ll see. 

           EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Yi leads them through the clearing to a stretch of railroad 
           track. They slow to a stop. 
                                 GRETA
                        This is getting old, Yi. Come on, 
                        Clinton, let’s go. 

           Greta grabs Clinton by the arm and turns. 

           Dave steps in front of them and gives a menacing stare. 

           Clinton suddenly turns to Yi.

                                 CLINTON
                        Look, Kano, or whatever your name 
                        is, I don’t know what you’re trying 
                        to pull, but I know. I know what--

           Dave grabs Clinton’s arm and twists it behind his back.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Christ.

           Yi chuckles. He nods to Dave. Dave releases Clinton’s arm.

                                 YI KIM
                        That’s a great hammerlock, Dave. 
                        He’s training for UFC. You okay, C-
                        man? We’re all friends here, we all 
                        trust each other, don’t we?

           Dave nods. 

           Yi rips his shirt off, revealing a lean and impeccably cut 
           chest. He throws his hair back and ties a tie dye headband. 

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

           Yi begins dancing about like a pre-match boxer. He swings his 
           arms wildly. The display is menacing, but somehow alluring. 
           The grace of a jungle puma.  

           Clinton furrows his brow. 

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        I’m feeling it tonight! You feeling 
                        it, Dave?

           Dave smiles slightly. 

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        I love it! I love it out here! You 
                        feeling it Clinton?

           Clinton stirs nervously. 
                                 CLINTON
                            (reluctant)
                        Um, yeah?

                                 YI KIM
                        You know, you don’t seem like some 
                        9 to 5 drone. You’re rebel, ain’t 
                        ya? A revolutionary. Like me. You 
                        don’t give a fuck. What do you do, 
                        Clintonio? Clint...Eastwood.

                                 CLINTON
                        I run a small shop.

                                 YI KIM
                        What do you sell?

                                 CLINTON
                        Um, collectible action figures. 

                                 YI KIM
                        Fuckin’ toys! Amazing! You can do 
                        anything, Clintonio. You know that? 
                        The world is your oyster! 

           Yi leans over and puts his ear to the railroad track. A 
           RUMBLE, followed shortly by the sound of a train HORN. 

           Yi hops onto the tracks. He closes his eyes and spreads his 
           arms out. He takes a meditative breath.

           A TRANSIT TRAIN at full-speed makes its way past a curve. 

                                 GRETA
                        Okay, Yi, enough!

           Clinton watches confused, horrified. 

           Yi flays his arms and tilts back in a Christ-like pose. 

           The TRAIN bears down. Another blast of the HORN. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        This is insane, Yi! Stop it!

                                 YI KIM
                            (eyes closed)
                        Clintonio, give me your hand 
                        please. 

           Clinton remains still. Dave gives Clinton a firm push. 

           Clinton moves his trembling hand to Yi’s, who clutches it. 
           The train HORN sounds. 

                                 GRETA
                        Yi!

                                 YI KIM
                        We’re all friends here, right? 
                        Friends trust each other.

           Clinton watches the TRAIN approach, petrified. Yi’s grip on 
           Clinton’s hand tightens. 

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                        It’s all about trust. 

           The TRAIN closes in. 

           Yi suddenly thrusts Clinton onto the rail track. He flops 
           onto on the wooden ties, prostrate. 

           Yi hops on top of Clinton, pinning him to the cross ties. 

                                 GRETA
                        Clinton!

           Greta lunges forward, but Dave holds her back. 

           Clinton looks up to the oncoming TRAIN. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Don’t do this. Please, don’t do 
                        this. 

           Yi leans into his ear. 

                                 YI KIM
                        You’ve been a nosey little kitty 
                        cat. We need to learn to trust each 
                        other. 

           Yi gives a tender kiss on the cheek. 

           VOOOOOOOOOOORRRSSSSHHHHH! 

           The TRAIN rushes above them. Inches away from Yi’s head. 

           Yi smiles, gleefully. 

           ON CLINTON

           His eyes closed, teeth grit.

           The SOUND of the train fades out to complete SILENCE.
           After a moment, Clinton opens his eyes. 

           The train has passed. Yi is gone.

           We see that Clinton is feebly clutching an ACTION FIGURE.

           The sound of HEAVY BREATHING above him.

           Clinton rolls over to see--

           Dave bearing down on him. He raises his massive fist.

           THUD.

           BLACK.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

           A strangely familiar suburban street. Mist hangs thick.

           Clinton wanders through the void.

                                 CLINTON
                        What’s going on?

           A PATTERING SOUND arises. 

           Clinton follows it. In the distance, someone appears to be--

           Dancing. It’s Yi, in a double breasted suit, tap dancing.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Why? Why would you...

           Yi pulls a crossbow from behind him and aims it at Clinton.

                                 YI KIM
                        Welcome to Ford’s Megastore.

           Clinton mouths the words “where you steal from us.”

           Yi Kim shoots the arrow directly at him. 

           The bolt flies towards us. Clinton closes his eyes.

           INT. GRETA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Clinton groggily opens his eyes. He lies in a half daze on a 
           couch. He peers around with heavy eyelids.

           Greta stands at the far end of the apartment, on the phone.
                                 GRETA
                            (urgent whisper)
                        No! There’s no one else. I don’t 
                        have to justify anything to you. 
                        Christ! Just let me live in peace. 

           She hangs up the phone and sighs heavily. She turns to find 
           Clinton coming to.

           She walks over and sits beside him. She presses a SLAB of 
           steak on his blackened eye.

                                 CLINTON
                        How’d I get here?

                                 GRETA
                        We walked. Well, I sort of carried 
                        you. 

                                 CLINTON
                        I don’t remember any of that. Oh 
                        god, I think I have memory loss. 
                        Was I hit by the train?

                                 GRETA
                        If that’s what you consider Dave 
                        Calvetti. You’re fine. Just a 
                        little bruised is all.

                                 CLINTON
                        I gotta go.

           He tries to get up, but his legs can’t support his weight. He 
           falls back to the sofa.

                                 GRETA
                        Easy there, bruiser. Stay put. I’ll 
                        be right back.

           She walks to the kitchen.

           Clinton picks up a loose CD from the coffee table and looks 
           at his reflection. He winces.

           Greta emerges from the kitchen with two steaming mugs. She 
           passes him one.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Here. Try this. My special recipe.

           He sips it and recoils.
                                 CLINTON
                        Is this just boiled whiskey?

                                 GRETA
                        Pretty much.

           She peers at him. She notices the Doghouse Reilly ACTION 
           FIGURE jutting from his breast pocket.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Did you make that one too?

           Embarrassed, Clinton tucks the head away and mumbles 
           something under his breath. 

           Greta reaches into her purse and pulls out the Mouser ACTION 
           FIGURE Clinton gave her. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Looks like they go together, are 
                        they partners? 

                                 CLINTON
                        Yes.
                            (changing the subject)
                        This steak smells funny. My eye 
                        better not get mad cow.

           Greta moves in closer to him. Clinton leans away. She reaches 
           for his breast pocket and takes out the action figure. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Hey! 

           She inspects the toy, the careful attention to detail.

                                 GRETA
                        It’s really good. How long have you 
                        been doing this? 

                                 CLINTON
                        I don’t know. Awhile. Hey, it’s 
                        midnight, “Step by Step” is on.

                                 GRETA
                        Come on. I’m just curious. I mean, 
                        have you always been into making 
                        these?

                                 CLINTON
                        Yeah. I mean, I don’t know. Since I 
                        was a kid I guess.
                                 GRETA
                        So you had like a little workshop?

                                 CLINTON
                        No. Like, I used to run around in 
                        tighty whities and a trench coat 
                        and try to interrogate strangers. 

           Greta chuckles.

                                 GRETA
                        Awww, cute. Little Clinton.

                                 CLINTON
                        I was fifteen. 

           She laughs out loud. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        I was very imaginative. 

                                 GRETA
                        You must have been a handful. What 
                        did your parents think?

           Clinton gets quiet. 

                                 CLINTON
                        My dad hated it. Pussbag. That’s 
                        what he used to call me. 

                                 GRETA
                        Pussbag? What does that even mean?

                                 CLINTON
                        I’m not sure. Puss, like I’m a 
                        pussy, and bag, like I’m a bag of 
                        it. Of pussies. Yeah, it doesn’t 
                        make much sense. 

                                 GRETA
                        What an asshole! And you still live 
                        with him?

                                 CLINTON
                        Fuck no. He left for greener 
                        pastures. He has some new family in 
                        Texas. He owns some pussbag store. 

           Greta takes this in. 

                                 GRETA
                        When did he leave?
           Clinton thinks for a moment. 

                                 CLINTON
                        I don’t remember, I was a kid. 

           Greta stares at him for a moment. Clinton meets her gaze.  

           She looks at him deeply and a smile creeps onto her face. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 GRETA
                        Get up. I want to do something for 
                        you. In the chair over there. Don’t 
                        argue, just go. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Greta, now in a tank top, straps on a stylist’s utility belt. 

           Clinton sits nervously in the makeshift barber’s chair. 

                                 CLINTON
                        I don’t know about this. I don’t 
                        let anyone touch my--

                                 GRETA
                        --Just stop talking. Relax. 

           Greta straightens his head and faces it towards the mirror. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Trust me. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           Greta spritzes Clinton’s hair with a spray bottle. 

           Greta runs her hands through his curls. Clinton tenses up. 

           SNIP. SNIP. SNIP. Greta, very focused, cuts with precision.         
           she works on his sideburns.

                                 CLINTON
                        Easy on the burns. I like--

                                 GRETA
                        --Sssshhhhhhh. 

           Greta rubs gel between her palms and massages her fingers 
           through his hair. 
           She walks around to the front of the chair to face him. She 
           leans in close and inspects the cut. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Do you mind?

           She gently sits on his lap. She licks the tips of her fingers 
           and adjusts the hair behind his ears. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        What do you think? 

                                 CLINTON
                        It’s, I don’t know. 

           Clinton looks like a different person. Mature. Adult. 

                                 GRETA
                        You look older. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Aw great. Thanks.

                                 GRETA
                        No. That’s a good thing. You look 
                        handsome. You look like a man.

                                 CLINTON
                        I don’t know if I wanna look like a 
                        man. 

           Greta leans in toward him.

                                 GRETA
                        I like it. 

           She leans in and kisses him. 

           Clinton freezes. He stares at her, eyes wide open.

           But he starts to go with it. He closes his eyes and awkwardly 
           puts his arms around her.

           She runs her fingers through his hair and kisses him deeply.

           She gently pull away, fixes his collar, and gazes at him.

           Clinton, flushed and dazed, smiles in spite of himself.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Are you sure you want this?
                                 CLINTON
                        Um, what do you mean?

                                 GRETA
                        I, um, I’ve made some mistakes. I 
                        don’t want to make them again.  

           Clinton looks confused.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        I need someone to be with me. Not 
                        against me.

                                 CLINTON
                        With you, like, to find Mouser’s 
                        killer? 

           Greta sighs.

                                 GRETA
                        Is that all you can think about? 

                                 CLINTON
                        Um, I’m not sure what we’re talking 
                        about.

                                 GRETA
                        Horatio--our cat is dead Clinton. 
                        But he brought us together.

                                 CLINTON
                        To find his killer.

           She shakes her head.

                                 GRETA
                        My life has enough problems. You 
                        can’t run around in a trench coat 
                        and tighty whities forever.

           Beat. 

                                 CLINTON
                        I see how it is.

                                 GRETA
                        No you don’t. That’s what I’m 
                        trying to say. I want---

                                 CLINTON
                        ---No. I know exactly what you’re 
                        saying. You’re just like everyone 
                        else.
           Clinton stands and heads for the door.

           Greta stands.

                                 GRETA
                        Hey!

           He stops and turns to her.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Whatever you think you’re after, 
                        it’s not worth it. 

           She wrings her hands and stares pensively at the floor.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        I knew about the scam, okay? That’s 
                        why I left the store. Don’t you 
                        fucking get it? Yi’s dangerous.

           Clinton glares at her.

                                 CLINTON
                        Thanks for the tip.

           He marches out.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. CLINTON’S ROOM - MORNING

           Clinton, in yesterday’s clothes, lies face down on his futon. 

           Laughter from upstairs wakes him with a snort. 

           Clinton rubs his aching neck as he rises. 

           More laughter. 

                                 CLINTON
                            (looking up)
                        Huh?

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton trudges upstairs. He peers into the kitchen.

           A GENTLEMAN sits at the table, reading a newspaper. His face 
           concealed with the Bethany Gazette. 

           Clinton freezes. 
           He watches for a moment. The Gentleman reaches for cup of 
           coffee, his face still a mystery. 

           Clinton takes a ROLLING PIN from a drawer and moves a few 
           quiet steps closer. 

           He readies the rolling pin, like a slugger. 

                                 EDIE (O.S.)
                        Clinton! You’re up. 

           Edie emerges in the doorway. 

           The paper lowers revealing Officer Frank Hoyle, all smiles. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Morning, hello. 

                                 EDIE
                            (awkward)
                        Clinton, honey, you remember Frank, 
                        don’t you?

           Clinton glares at Officer Hoyle. 

                                 CLINTON
                        No I don’t know any Frank. I know 
                        an Officer Hoyle, but...
                            (beat)
                        Is he wearing my robe?

                                 EDIE
                        I didn’t know if you were coming 
                        home last night.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Don’t worry, Clinton, I’ll wash it. 

                                 CLINTON
                        You might as well burn it, because 
                        I will never wear that thing again. 

           Edie shoots him a black look.

                                 EDIE
                        You got a haircut. It looks 
                        distinguished. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        It does.

                                 CLINTON
                        Stop talking about my hair.
           Edie serves up two steaming breakfast plates.

                                 EDIE
                        Why don’t you sit down and eat for 
                        a second. I made your favorite, 
                        chocolate pancakes.

           Clinton crosses his arms, stubbornly. A quiet rebellion.

           As the aroma tickles his nostrils, he slowly sits down and 
           stuffs a pancake into his mouth. 

                                 EDIE (CONT’D)
                        Where have you been Clinton? I was 
                        worried.

                                 CLINTON
                        Hmmm. You had time to worry during 
                        your sexcapades with this doughnut 
                        husker?

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Hey, watch your mouth, peewee. 

                                 CLINTON
                        You watch your mouth! This is my 
                        house. I can act any way I want.

           Edie slams the spatula against the counter.

                                 EDIE
                        Actually, it’s my house. And is it 
                        too much to ask for you to be nice, 
                        just once?

                                 CLINTON
                        Nice? Okay. 
                            (to Hoyle)
                        I got a nice little tip for you. 
                        She’s got the gout. Real bad. S’why 
                        she never takes off her socks.

           Officer Hoyle casts a furtive glance at her socked feet.

                                 EDIE
                        I...have chilly feet. 

           Her face flushes over and she storms out of the room.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Look, Clinton, I know this is 
                        awkward. But I’d like to try and be 
                        friends.
           Clinton scowls. But a thought occurs to him.

                                 CLINTON
                        Alright, you wanna be my friend? I 
                        know who killed Mouser. I wanna go 
                        there. Now. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Whoa whoa. What are you talking 
                        about? 

                                 CLINTON
                        Yi Kim. That’s who did it. And I 
                        wanna get him today. Now.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        You mean Rogin Kim’s son? Of Kim’s 
                        Tuxedos? 

                                 CLINTON
                        He’s running this huge scam 
                        involving the crossbows at Ford’s. 
                        He killed the cat to put a scare 
                        into Greta, the one who stole 
                        Mouser. She knew about the scam.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Frankly, this sounds ridiculous. 

                                 CLINTON
                        You’re doin’ it, or I’m drivin’ you 
                        outta here. 

           Officer Hoyle sighs, then checks his watch.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        I guess I have some time before my 
                        shift.

           DING DONG. 

           INT/EXT. DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton answers the door. 

           Greta stands on the stoop holding Clinton’s DOGHOUSE REILLY 
           action figure.

                                 GRETA
                        Hey. You, uh, left this last night.

           Clinton gazes at her.
                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        I thought maybe we could talk. I’m 
                        sorry things got weird last night. 

           Officer Hoyle arrives at the door with his police uniform on. 
           He adjusts his badge as he makes his way toward the car.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                            (to Greta)
                        Excuse me.
                            (to Clinton)
                        Clinton, we better get going if 
                        we’re gonna do this.

           Greta watches wide-eyed, confused.

                                 CLINTON
                        Just warm her up, Hoyle. I’ll meet 
                        you in the squad car in T-minus one 
                        minute.

           Officer Hoyle shakes his head and shuffles to the car. 

           Greta leans into Clinton.

                                 GRETA
                            (sotto)
                        What are you doing? 

                                 CLINTON
                        I’m taking care of a little thing 
                        called justice. It’s not a good day 
                        to be Yi Kim if you know what I 
                        mean.

                                 GRETA
                        Clinton. Pease don’t do this! I’m 
                        telling you it will come back to 
                        me.

           He starts for the car. She reaches for his arm.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        Clinton. 

           He marches past her.

                                 CLINTON
                        This ends today. 
           INT. SQUAD CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Officer Hoyle pulls up in front of an upper middle class 
           home. Yi Kim’s. 

           Clinton peers at the house with disgust. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Rich spoiled bastard. Makes me 
                        sick. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Okay, look, Clinton, what we’re 
                        doing here is not exactly police 
                        protocol. You can’t go in there and 
                        start looking around and making 
                        accusations. We don’t have a 
                        warrant. So let me do the talking 
                        here. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Don’t worry, this place is 
                        going to be stacked to the ceiling 
                        with stolen goods. I’m pretty much 
                        handing you an easy collar. 

           Officer Hoyle rolls his eyes. 

           EXT. YI KIM’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Officer Hoyle strides to the door, Clinton follows.   

           Clinton reaches for the doorbell. Officer Hoyle stops him. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Let me, please. 

           Officer Hoyle presses the doorbell. 

           After a moment, a cute Korean girl, RAMMY (6), opens the 
           door. She wears a tutu. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Who are you? Where’s Yi? 

           Officer Hoyle nudges Clinton with his elbow. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Hi sweetie, is your father here? 
           Rammy nods. 

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton and Officer Hoyle emerge through the sliding door.

           On the porch, a prim short man in a polo shirt, measures out 
           2x4s. This is ROGIN KIM (50s), earnest and proud. 

           Rammy yells from the door. 

                                 RAMMY
                        DAAAAD!

           Rogin Kim looks up to see Officer Hoyle and Clinton. He wipes 
           his hands off on a rag and approaches. 

                                 ROGIN KIM
                            (mild concern)
                        Morning, officer, can I help you?

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Hi, Mr. Kim. Officer Frank Hoyle.
                            (shakes)
                        We were just wondering if we could 
                        have a quick word with your son? 

                                 ROGIN KIM
                        With Yi? Is he in trouble?

                                 CLINTON
                        He’s fucked--

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        --No, we just want to have a talk 
                        with him. Clear something up. 

           Rogin Kim nods, concerned. He leads them to the shed at the 
           back of the yard. 

           Wood sanding SOUNDS. 

           Yi kneels hunched over, intently working on something unseen. 

                                 ROGIN KIM
                        Yi!

           Yi stops and turns around. His hair tied in a ponytail, he 
           wears golf shorts and a polo. 

                                 YI KIM
                        What’s going on, Dad?
           Clinton raises an eye brow. 

           Yi walks to them, holding a round wooden OBJECT. He addresses 
           Clinton and Officer Hoyle without a hint of suspicion. He 
           shows Rogin Kim the object - a wood carving of his sister’s 
           face. A perfect likeness.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        My god, is that your sister? That’s 
                        amazing.

                                 YI KIM
                        I’m struggling with it. Oak is a 
                        tricky medium. I still think the 
                        eye lashes could use some work. 
                        Anyway, what’s going on? 

                                 CLINTON
                        Don’t act like you don’t know. You 
                        know exactly why we’re here.

                                 YI KIM
                        Clinton, right?

                                 CLINTON
                        Yi, it’s over. I told him 
                        everything. The store, the threats, 
                        my cat. Just come clean and maybe 
                        we’ll cut you some kind of deal. We 
                        can do that right Hoyle?

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Clinton, shut up. Yi, what happened 
                        at the Megastore yesterday?

           Beat.

                                 YI KIM
                        Well, I wanted to be forgiving 
                        about this whole thing. I didn’t 
                        want to report it. But, I guess I 
                        have no choice now. Clinton broke 
                        into the warehouse of Ford’s 
                        Megastore yesterday. Call me a 
                        softie, but he was apologetic and I 
                        accepted that. I just didn’t think 
                        I had to get the authorities 
                        involved.  

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Clinton, did you break into Ford’s 
                        Megastore? 
           Clinton grits his teeth. 

                                 CLINTON
                        NO.
                            (beat)
                        Well, technically yes. But it was 
                        for the purpose of good. I was 
                        undercover. Deep cover.

                                 ROGIN KIM
                        This is your partner?

                                 CLINTON
                        Look, he’s stealing from Ford’s. 
                        He’s got this whole scam with 
                        crossbows in laptop boxes. I mean, 
                        laptops in crossbows boxes. It’s 
                        very elaborate. 

                                 YI KIM
                        This is what I get for taking pity 
                        on you?

                                 CLINTON
                        Goddamnit! Can’t you see he’s lying 
                        through his teeth?! I wanna see his 
                        room! I guarantee it’s jam packed 
                        with stolen merchandise and drugs. 
                        I swear to god!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. YI KIM’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A neat, perfectly organized bedroom. The walls are lined with 
           bookshelves. A painting of Abraham Lincoln hangs above a bed.

           Clinton, Officer Hoyle, Yi, and Rogin Kim stand in the 
           doorway. Clinton peers around.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Alright, I think we’ve bothered 
                        these two enough for one day. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Hold on. 

           Clinton walks into the room for a closer inspection. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Clinton, no!
                                 YI KIM
                        It’s okay. I don’t mind.

           Clinton scans his desk and finds nothing out of the ordinary. 
           He points to a pad scribbled with diagrams and equations. 

                                 CLINTON
                        And what’s this Yi, the numbers 
                        you’re running on your operation?

                                 YI KIM
                            (dryly)
                        Um, no, that’s the plans for the 
                        tree house my father and I are 
                        building?

                                 CLINTON
                        Tree house?

                                 YI KIM
                        Yes, for my sister and all her 
                        friends.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Okay, it’s time we go, Clinton. 
                        Come on.

           Clinton’s eyes do a final search. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry for the inconvenience, 
                        we’ll be on our way. 

                                 YI KIM
                        It’s no problem. 

           Officer Hoyle perks up at noticing the Lincoln portrait. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        You’re an admirer of Lincoln? I’m a  
                        Lincoln man myself.
                            (quoting)
                        "Leave nothing for tomorrow which 
                        can be done today."

           Yi slowly turns to Clinton.

                                 YI KIM
                        “The demon of intemperance ever 
                        seems to have delighted in sucking 
                        the blood of genius and of 
                        generosity.” Springfield, Illinois, 
                        February 22, 1842.
           Clinton glares at Yi with simmering hatred. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Impressive. 

           Clinton suddenly spots a point-and-shoot CAMERA on Yi’s 
           bedside table. He raises an eyebrow.  

                                 OFFICER HOYLE (CONT’D)
                        Clinton, let’s go. Come on. 

           Clinton sighs.

           Rogin Kim, Yi, and Officer Hoyle turn to leave. 

           Clinton SWIPES the CAMERA off the table.

           INT. CAR - AFTERNOON

           Officer Hoyle drives. Clinton sits passenger, sulking. 

           Awkward silence. 

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Clinton, I really like your mom. 
                        She’s a wonderful and beautiful 
                        woman. So I’m going to pretend I 
                        didn’t hear some of the things I 
                        heard back there. This is the 
                        second time a person has accused 
                        you of breaking and entering. We’re 
                        talking multiple felonies here. If 
                        it happens again, I’m haulin’ you 
                        in. You are done with this 
                        business. Done. Leave it to the 
                        authorities. And I’m not asking. 

           Beat. Clinton sighs heavily.

                                 CLINTON
                        You’re right, Frank. I appreciate 
                        that. 

           Officer Hoyle nods. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        And now that we know each other 
                        better and that you’re getting 
                        involved with my mom and all, 
                        there’s something very important I 
                        think you should know...
           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           SCREEEEEEEEEEEECH! The police cruiser brakes to a stop. 

           Clinton exits the car, swiftly. 

           The cruiser peels out. 

           EXT. BUSY STREET - LATER

           Clinton trudges down the street, peering at Yi’s camera.

           ANGLE ON CAMERA: Various pictures of Yi posing shirtless, 
           some party shots of Yi and Dave Calvetti drinking forties, a 
           photo of Greta and Yi blowing smoke rings from a joint.

           Clinton sighs. 

           He toggles through more photos. 

           ANGLE ON CAMERA: pictures of LAPTOPS from various angles.  
           Product photos. Jackpot. 

           Clinton’s eyes light up. He ponders, paces nervously. 

           His gaze lands on a BILLBOARD across the street, Ford’s Mega-
           Store. Ford poses with his wife and children, the all 
           American family. “Ford’s: The Neighborhood Store.”

           EXT. FORD’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           A McMansion. An elaborate landscaped lawn. A fountain out 
           front. A six car garage. The earmarks of old money. 

           Clinton approaches the imposing oak doorway. He swings a 
           brass door knocker. The reverberations ECHO within the house. 

           FOOTSTEPS approach and the door creaks open, revealing a 
           squat Latina maid, ROSALITA (40s). 

                                 ROSALITA
                        Can I help you?

                                 CLINTON
                        Are you Mrs. Ford? I’m looking 
                        for...Ford.

                                 ROSALITA
                        Mrs. Ford is not here. And Mr. Ford 
                        is not well right now. 
                                 CLINTON
                        It’s urgent. I need to see him.

                                 ROSALITA
                        I’m sorry, sir. Mr. Ford say no 
                        visitors.

           She closes the door, but Clinton wedges his foot inside.

                                 ROSALITA (CONT’D)
                        Hay, senor!

           Clinton pushes past her and marches into the house.

           INT. FORD’S HOUSE - DEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton walks through an expansive den. High ceilings, a 
           glistening chandelier, a grandfather clock.

           He looks around in awe. Rosalita follows after him.

                                 ROSALITA
                        No, senor, this is NOT allowed. 

           She tugs on his shirt. Clinton shrugs her off and runs up the 
           grand stairway.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton makes his way down a long corridor. Elegant oil 
           paintings line the wall. The Fords through the generations.

           The faint SOUND of a television emerges from a nearby room. 
           Clinton follows it. 

           He lightly presses on the door. It slowly swings open. 

           INT. ENTERTAINMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Clinton cautiously steps into the dimly lit room. 

           A 60s era action film projects on a wall. 

           The room is in complete disarray.

           Clinton rounds a sofa chair to find -- Ford, listless and 
           wearing a terry cloth robe and boxers. He has a three-day-old 
           beard, red sleepless eyes, and disheveled hair. He puffs on a 
           briar wood pipe. 
                                 CLINTON
                        Ford? Jesus.

                                 FORD
                        How’d you get in here?

                                 CLINTON
                        I have some urgent information 
                        about your store. I had no other 
                        choice.

           Rosalita emerges in the doorway, out of breath.

                                 ROSALITA
                        Mr. Ford, sorry. He no listen, he 
                        just come in. 

                                 FORD
                        Remember what we discussed about 
                        looking me in the eye.

           She lowers her gaze.

                                 ROSALITA
                        Si. Yes. I’m sorry sir. Can I get 
                        you anything?

                                 FORD
                        Indeed. I’d like some ice cream.

                                 ROSALITA
                        We’re out of ice cream, sir.

                                 FORD
                        In that case, get me a bourbon. 
                        Pint glass. To the brim.

           Rosalita takes Clinton by the arm and attempts to lead him 
           out of the room.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        No. He stays. 

           Rosalita glares at Clinton before stepping out. 

                                 CLINTON
                        She has the grip of a stevedore.

           Ford refills his pipe. 

           Clinton gazes at Ford, befuddled.
                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on with you, Ford? 
                        Jesus you look like some kind 
                        of...transient.

                                 FORD
                        Can’t a man just watch “Ice Station 
                        Zebra” in the comfort of his own 
                        home?

           Clinton peers at the projection screen - Ernest Borgnine and 
           Rock Hudson arguing in the captain’s quarters of a submarine.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        This is my fourth time watching it. 
                        Today. It’s meaning is becoming 
                        clearer to me.

                                 CLINTON
                        Ford, I’m here to talk to you about 
                        the store. There’s a major theft 
                        operation--

                                 FORD
                        Shhhh. This is my favorite part.

           Clinton sighs and walks over to him. He removes the camera 
           from his pocket and holds it in front of Ford’s face.

                                 CLINTON
                        Yi Kim is stealing from you. He’s 
                        running a huge scam right under 
                        your nose! HE’S the one who killed 
                        my cat.

           Ford’s attention stays on the film. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Do you hear what I’m saying?

           Rosalita enters the room with the pint glass of bourbon and a 
           sheath of legal papers.

           She carefully hands both to Ford, trying not to look him in 
           the eyes. 

                                 FORD
                        What’s this?

                                 ROSALITA
                        A fax, senor. From Mrs. Ford. 
                                 FORD
                        So now she’s afraid to bring it in 
                        person?!

           Ford snatches it from her and looks it over. His eyes narrow 
           as he flips through each page. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        She’s wants fucking everything! I’m 
                        not signing this. 

           Ford throws his glass across the room. SMASH. He leaps to his 
           feet and points directly at Rosalita. She awkwardly shifts 
           around to avoid direct eye contact.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You tell her I’m not afraid of 
                        Levinson, Levinson & Rothberg! I’ll 
                        see her in hell before I sign this. 

           Rosalita nods and shuffles out of the room.

           Clinton watches on in shock.

           Ford raises his hand to his mouth.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit! Where’s my bourbon?!

                                 CLINTON
                        Um. You just threw it against the 
                        wall. 

           Ford turns to him sharply.

                                 FORD
                        So you have all the answers huh? 
                        I’m supposed to believe Yi Kim is 
                        stealing from Al Ford? AL FORD. Al 
                        Ford doesn’t get scammed by weirdo 
                        stockboys and he certainly doesn’t 
                        listen to pinheads like you.

           Clinton holds the camera in front of Ford. Ford snatches it.

           ANGLE ON: Photos of various merchandise. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Product photos for resale. You see? 
                        He’s stealing them in the surplus 
                        crossbow boxes and handing them 
                        off. Thousands of dollars worth. I 
                        just don’t know who the fence is.
                                 FORD
                            (sotto)
                        Sonovabitch.

           Ford stops scrolling. His face hardens.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Greta? 

           Clinton takes a look at the camera - the picture of Yi and 
           Greta smoking. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Oh yeah. She knew. Err, she may 
                        have. Actually, I don’t know. She’s 
                        innocent though. 

           Ford breathes heavily and hands the camera back to Clinton. 
           His face turns beet red. 

                                 FORD
                        Is the whole world trying to FUCK 
                        me?!

           Ford storms out of the room.

           EXT. FORD’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ford, still in only a bathrobe and boxers, strides to his 
           Mercedes. 

           Clinton runs out of the house after him.

                                 CLINTON
                        Ford! The hell are you doing?

           Ford gets in the car and starts it.

           Clinton runs around to the passenger side and leaps into the 
           moving car. 

           INT. FORD’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Ford slams on the breaks.

                                 FORD
                        Get out.

                                 CLINTON
                        No.
           Ford grabs him by the collar and shoves him out the door.

           Clinton fends him off and clings to the seat like a stubborn 
           child. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                            (desperate)
                        This is my battle too. I’m coming! 

           Ford finally lets go.

                                 FORD
                        Fuck it.

           He slams on the gas and explodes out of the driveway. 

           INT. FORD’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ford drives like a bat out of hell through the quiet streets.

           Clinton clings to the seat for dear life. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Hey! You just passed Yi’s!

           Ford keeps driving. Silent. Determined.  

           INT. FORD’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ford veers into the Hope’s Crossing parking lot. 

           He skids to a stop over the curb below Greta’s window.

                                 CLINTON
                        Why are we at Greta’s? I told you 
                        she wasn’t involved! 

           Ford ignores him and steps out of the car. Clinton follows. 

           EXT. HOPE’S CROSSING - CONTINUOUS

           Ford picks up an empty beer bottle from his car and hurls it 
           at Greta’s window. It shatters on the side of the building.

                                 FORD
                        Greta! You bitch. Did you think I 
                        wouldn’t find out?!

           Greta appears behind the window. 
           Upon seeing Clinton she looks stung. A betrayal. She closes 
           the shades forcefully.

           Clinton bites his lip. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Are you deaf man?! I’m telling you 
                        it’s Yi. She’s got nothing to do 
                        with this!

           Ford ignores him and walks to his car.

           At a loss, Clinton peers at Greta’s window. 

           SMASH! Clinton turns to find the Benz backing up from Greta’s 
           car. Steam rises from Greta’s hood. SMASH! He drives into it 
           again.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?!

           Greta opens her window.

                                 GRETA
                        Oh my god.

           She disappears inside the apartment.

           Clinton jumps onto Ford’s hood.

                                 CLINTON
                        Stop, you madman!

                                 FORD
                        Get off!

                                 CLINTON
                        Why are you doing this?!

           Ford sighs.

                                 FORD
                        You idiot. She’s the fence. 

           Clinton absorbs this. Confusion spreads across his face.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Now move.

           Ford hits the gas and Clinton slides off the hood. 

           SMASH. Ford delivers one last punishing blow to Greta’s car. 
           Her bumper falls the ground with a THUD.
           Ford peels out of the lot. 

           Clinton watches him drive away, then slowly gets to his feet. 

           Greta emerges from the complex and approaches the demolished 
           car. She looks over the damage. She touches the dangling 
           rearview mirror. It falls off. 

                                 GRETA
                        Harvey.

           She turns to Clinton, her eyes welling up.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        How could you?!

           Beat. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Are you the fence?

           Greta gives him a cold stare. 

                                 GRETA
                        Get the fuck outta here, Clinton. I 
                        don’t want to ever see you again.

           Clinton just stands there.

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        GO!!!

           Confused, Clinton opens his mouth but nothing comes out. 

           He turns and walks away.

           EXT. CLINTON’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Forlorn, Clinton walks across the lawn. 

           The porch light suddenly flicks on. 

           Clinton looks up. 

           Edie bursts from the front door. She marches to Clinton. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Ma, not now. 

           Edie stops abruptly and glares at him. 
                                 EDIE
                        I’m gonna ask you a question and I 
                        want the truth. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Um, okay.

                                 EDIE
                        Did you tell Frank that I have 
                        AIDS? 

           Clinton hesitates. He smacks his lips. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CLINTON’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Edie tosses an arm full of clothes out the side window. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Ma, what are you doing! It was a 
                        joke. Hoyle obviously has no sense 
                        of humor! 

           Clinton collects the clothes sprawled out on the lawn. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        You can’t kick me out! Where am I 
                        supposed sleep!

                                 EDIE
                        Frank is right, I’ve been spoiling 
                        you. This is for your own good!

                                 CLINTON
                        Hoyle said that? You’re taking his 
                        side over your own child?!

                                 EDIE
                        You’re a grown man!

           Edie takes a handful of ACTION FIGURES and begins to fling 
           them out the window one by one. 

                                 CLINTON
                        STOP THAT! You have any idea what 
                        those are worth!

           Clinton scrambles to collect the fallen figures. 

           Edie closes the window and disappears from view.
                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        I’ll die out here, ma!
                            (beat)
                        Ma?

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

           Clinton wanders down the desolate street, a trash bag over 
           his shoulder. 

           A chilly breeze. Clinton rubs his arms.

           A fog slowly settles over the street. Clinton peers around. 

           A faint MEOWING emerges from somewhere unseen.

                                 CLINTON
                        Hello?

           The MEOWING continues, gets closer.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Mouser?

           Clinton quickens his pace, but the fog only grows thicker. 

           Clinton glances up to see the FORD’S MEGASTORE BILLBOARD in 
           the distance. 

           MEOW. MEOW. MEOW. He furls his brow.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Mouser?

           A break in the fog. A huddled FORM lies on the street.

           Turning over, we see that it’s Greta. Blood seeps from a 
           wound on her chest. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Greta!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT

           Clinton awakens with a start to find himself on a park bench.

           THUNDER claps across the night sky. 

           Heavy rain suddenly begins to pour.
           Clinton quickly stands and looks up at the sky, the rain 
           beading off him. A hateful scowl comes over his face.

           He quickly grabs a large text book from his bag. He holds it 
           over his head. But it’s pointless, he’s already soaked.

                                 CLINTON
                        FUCK!!!

           He shoves his hands in his pockets for warmth, but notices 
           something inside. He pulls out Yi’s CAMERA.

           He glares at it with contempt, then tosses it against the 
           ground.

           It doesn’t break. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Sonova!

           He marches over to it and kneels down to pick it up.

           He stops. The photograph on the display catches his 
           attention. He picks it up and takes a closer look.

           ANGLE ON: Yi Kim standing outside the warehouse next to a 
           stack of stolen goods. In the background -- the white van.

           Clinton narrows his eyes. He zooms into the van.

           ANGLE ON: We zoom in closer. The side mirror. The driver’s 
           face reflected. A familiar face -- FORD. 

           Clinton goes pale.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Ford’s the fence. He’s stealing 
                        from himself!

           Clinton runs off. 

           EXT. FORD’S MEGASTORE - NIGHT

           Clinton crests the hill and peers down at the warehouse.

           The WHITE VAN is parked by the lift gate in the back.

           EXT. FORD’S MEGASTORE - WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton creeps along the side of the building.
           WHIMPERING emerges from around the corner.

           Clinton gets to the edge. He carefully takes a peek.

           The white van idles in the middle of the lot, its back doors 
           open. Boxes are strewn about in disarray.

           Two fallen MAGLITES cast beams of light across the dark 
           asphalt. One illuminates the hunched figure of--

           Dave Calvetti. He kneels before a prostrate FIGURE. Dave 
           whimpers quietly.

           Clinton accidentally makes a RUSTLE.

           Dave suddenly turns and looks at Clinton. He grabs the 
           Maglite and stands menacingly.

           The Figure’s hand rises and clutches Dave’s wrist.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        No, Tenderfoot.

           Dave Calvetti stands back, revealing the Figure to be--

           Yi Kim. Blood drips from his nose and mouth. One eye is 
           swollen shut.

                                 CLINTON
                        Yi? My god.

                                 YI KIM
                        Clintonio? 

           Yi beckons him over. 

           Clinton goes to him. He kneels beside a heartbroken Dave. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Who did this to you? 

           Yi weakly raises his arm.

                                 YI KIM
                        Take my hand.

           Clinton takes it and peers into his eyes. Yi indicates 
           Clinton’s pocket.

                                 YI KIM (CONT’D)
                            (feebly)
                        Your pocket.
           Confused, Clinton reaches into his pocket. He finds a 
           cigarette.

                                 CLINTON
                        I don’t understand. What is thibb--

           Yi shushes him with a finger on his lips.

           He delicately reaches into Clinton’s mouth and produces 
           another cigarette. 

           Dave watches, wistfully. A solitary tear on his cheek. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Alright Yi, I’m calling the cops.

           Yi puts both cigarettes in his mouth. Dave lights them. 

           Yi struggles to form words.

                                 YI KIM
                        Greta. 

           The cigarettes fall from Yi’s mouth. He closes his eyes.

                                 CLINTON
                        Yi! Where is she? What the fuck is 
                        going on?

           Yi reopens his eyes. 

                                 YI KIM
                        She needs you. 

           Yi shuts his eyes again. 

           Clinton stands, exasperated. He turns to Dave.

                                 CLINTON
                        He’s gonna be okay. Just call the 
                        police. 

           Clinton runs off. 

           EXT. HOPE’S CROSSING - NIGHT

           Clinton, thoroughly soaked, strides to the complex. 

           A MAN in a jumpsuit rigs Greta’s car onto a TOW TRUCK.

           Clinton looks up to Greta’s window. The lights are out. 
           EXT. MCGILLICUTTY’S PUB - NIGHT

           Torrential downpour.

           Clinton makes his way through the parking lot.

           Clinton peers around and spots -- Ford’s baby blue Mercedes 
           Benz, badly battered. 

           Clinton cautiously makes his way towards the car.

           He peers inside. No sign of Ford. Clinton glances around him. 

                                 FORD (O.S.)
                        Over here. 

           Clinton turns and squints to see through the rain--

           Under an awning, a shadowy FIGURE leans against a brick wall. 
           A cigarette glows in the darkness. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Ford?

           Clinton hesitates, then walks under the rain-drenched awning. 

           Ford, still in his robe and boxers, gazes despondently at the 
           parking lot. He quietly sucks on a cigarette.

           Ford raises a small WHISKEY BOTTLE to his lips and takes a 
           swig. There is blood on his knuckles.

           Clinton peers at him with steely eyes.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        You had to have everything, huh, 
                        Ford? You put a Megastore in this 
                        town and ran out all the local 
                        businesses - including mine - and 
                        you turned a massive profit. But it 
                        wasn’t enough - the palace, the 
                        fast cars. You needed another 
                        chandelier for your chandelier. So 
                        you ran a scam from the inside. And 
                        you thought you were sittin’ 
                        pretty. Until your assistant 
                        manager caught wind of it and quit 
                        on you. You couldn’t have her 
                        running her mouth. So how’d you 
                        shut her up? You kill her beloved 
                        cat with an untraceable crossbow. 
                        You sick fuck. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        But you didn’t count on the cat 
                        having another owner did ya? A 
                        pinhead. A loser. A guy out for the 
                        truth. So you want the truth now? 
                        You’re the fucking loser Ford. 
                        America’s family store. Pathetic. I 
                        may be a loser. But at least I’m 
                        not a phony.

           Beat. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Now where’s Greta?

           No answer. Clinton raises his cell phone.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        You see this? This is all going on 
                        Officer Frank Hoyle’s voicemail as 
                        we speak. It’s over. Just tell me 
                        where she is, Ford. 

           Ford slouches to the ground. He begins to weep quietly. 

           Clinton watches, astonished.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Are you...crying?

           Ford looks away and rubs his eyes. 

                                 FORD
                        I’m broke. I have nothing. The 
                        store’s going under. It’s been in 
                        the red for months.

                                 CLINTON
                        Ford’s Megastore?

                                 FORD
                        And my wife’s taking me for 
                        everything. The house - Everything. 
                            (beat)
                        I am a phony. You’re right about 
                        that. My whole life is an act.

           Ford wipes the stray tears from his eyes. 

           Clinton stirs uncomfortably.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I never wanted any of this. The 
                        store, it was my wife’s idea. This 
                        life, it was my father’s. 
           Ford takes a moment. He turns to Clinton.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I played Biff in an Ohio State 
                        production of “Death of a 
                        Salesman.” The Lantern said it was 
                        an “inspired performance.” Theater 
                        was my dream.

           Ford gazes into the distance, musing.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I had headshots made and I took 
                        them home for Thanksgiving. When I 
                        showed them to my dad, he laughed 
                        at me. He thought I was joking. I 
                        was so embarrassed I didn’t know 
                        what to do. So I just went along 
                        with it. I laughed with him.

           Ford reaches into his wallet and removes a small weathered 
           WALLET-SIZED PHOTO.

           Clinton kneels down and takes the picture. 

           It’s the headshot. Ford is about Clinton’s age - a bowl cut 
           and an earnest open-mouth smile. “Al Ford” is printed in 
           Ariel Bold at the bottom.

                                 CLINTON
                        That’s you?

           Ford nods. He takes another swig from the bottle.

                                 FORD
                        The irony is, I got stuck with one 
                        role for the rest of my life. The 
                        role of Al Ford. 

           Clinton hands him back the headshot.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Listen, if you don’t to go after 
                        what you want, I mean, really go 
                        for it, you’ll end up like me. With 
                        nothing.  

           Clinton takes this in. He gives Ford an earnest look. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Al, I just want to know where she 
                        is.
           Ford looks up at McGillicutty’s, then down at the ground. He 
           sighs heavily.

                                 FORD
                        Does she love you?

                                 CLINTON
                        What?

                                 FORD
                        Greta. Does she love you?

                                 CLINTON
                        I really have no idea--

           SMASH. Ford throws the bottle to the ground. 

           He turns to Clinton, a fiery look in his eyes.

                                 FORD
                        I need to know. Yi told me 
                        everything. It was you! DOES SHE 
                        LOVE YOU?!

           Clinton’s eyes widen. He begins to understand.

           Out of the corner of his eye he sees--

           Greta coming out of the pub. Ford sees too. 

           Ford and Clinton meet eyes for a pregnant moment. Then--

           WHAM! Ford punches Clinton in the face. 

           Clinton stumbles back. His head collides with the brick wall.

           Ford tries to go after her, but Clinton grabs his robe. 

           Ford yanks it away, ripping it. He dashes off.

           Clinton, in a daze, looks up. 

           In the distance, Ford chases Greta.

                                 CLINTON
                        Greta! 

           He spots Ford’s CAR KEYS on the ground. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. FORD’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Clinton starts the car. Scans the dashboard controls. Tries 
           the windshield wipers, the air conditioner. Finally, the 
           headlights flare on.

           He hits the gas. VROOOOOOOOOM!

           The car revs, but stays in place. Clinton looks around him 
           confused, then realizes the car is in PARK. He shifts and 
           slams the gas again. 

           BA-DOOOMP! The car REVERSES over the parking block and stops. 

                                 CLINTON
                        FUCK!

           He shifts into DRIVE and floors it. 

           The car lurches forward into the parking lot. He spins the 
           wheel and veers onto the road.

           Clinton clutches the wheel and skids down a suburban street. 

           A thick mist hangs low in the air. Clinton struggles to see 
           through the fogged windshield. He wipes it with his sleeve. 

           Ford and Greta appear ahead. Clinton hits the horn and jerks 
           the steering wheel.

           The car veers left. Clinton slams the brakes.

           But suddenly, he’s drifting, hydroplaning.

           He careens out of control.

           THUD. Ford topples over the hood and flops onto the other 
           side of the car.

           The car continues sliding, heading straight for a LAMP POST. 

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        OH SHI--

           SMASH!

                                                              FADE OUT.
           INT/EXT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton comes to, his head resting on the steering wheel. He 
           looks up at a lamp post jammed into the hood. 

           The car alarm blares. Smoke emanates from the engine.

           Clinton kicks open the door and falls out onto the asphalt.

           Greta stands in the middle of the street in complete shock.

                                 GRETA
                        Clinton?! Jesus, are you okay?

                                 CLINTON
                        I...I think so.

           Clinton tries to get to his feet, but immediately collapses.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Greta, listen--

           THUD. The trunk of the car opens. 

           Clinton turns to see Ford, bloodied and bruised, hunched over 
           the trunk.  

           Ford removes a Sure Shot 5000 CROSSBOW and trains it on 
           Greta.

           Greta attempts to run.

                                 FORD
                        Don’t fucking move!

           Greta stops and slowly turns to him.

           Clinton desperately drags himself toward her.

                                 CLINTON
                        Don’t do it, Al.

           Ford points the crossbow at Clinton.

                                 FORD
                        Shut the fuck up.

           Ford turns back to Greta. He peers at her through the 
           crosshairs. He breathes erratically. Tears well in his eyes.

                                 GRETA
                        It was YOU.
                                 FORD
                        Greta, I love you. Come with me. I 
                        have money now. I figured it out 
                        for us.

           Inching slowly, Clinton continues to crawl towards Greta.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Bora Bora, like we talked about. 

                                 GRETA
                        It’s a fantasy! You used me as an 
                        escape. You need help, Al.

                                 FORD
                        I need you!

                                 GRETA
                        You want me to go away with you and 
                        you’re threatening to shoot me! 
                        You’re insane. You killed my cat!

                                 FORD
                        You loved that cat more than me! 

           Tears stream down Ford’s face. His finger dangles over the 
           trigger. 

           Clinton gets to his feet and quickly jumps in front of Greta.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Move!

                                 CLINTON
                        Just put it down, Al. 

                                 FORD
                        Get the fuck out of the way!

           Clinton spreads his arms.

                                 CLINTON
                        You’ve hurt her enough. I’m not 
                        gonna let you do it. I’m not 
                        moving. If you want somebody to 
                        shoot, then shoot me goddammit--

           FWOOP.

           Clinton looks down. An arrow juts out of his thigh.

           Blood slowly collects in an expanding circle.
                                 GRETA
                        Oh my god!

           Clinton grits teeth.

                                 CLINTON
                        You fucking shot me? You actually--

           FWOOP. Ford shoots him again higher up on the thigh.

           Clinton looks down in shock.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Nnnngggg.

           Tears well in Greta’s eyes.

                                 GRETA
                        Stop! Please! Just--

           Clinton collapses.

           Greta kneels beside him. She takes his head in her hands.

           Ford watches in resignation. He grabs another arrow and 
           reloads the crossbow. 

           Ford sits on the edge of the trunk and sighs. With a faraway 
           look in his eyes, he turns the crossbow around and awkwardly 
           points it at himself. 

           Clinton gazes at him through glassy eyes.

                                 CLINTON
                        Al.

           Ford turns to Clinton, the crossbow inches from his face.  

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do it. It’s not worth it. 
                        And, honestly I don’t think it’ll 
                        even work. It’ll be painful and 
                        you’ll probably just end up 
                        deformed.
                            (beat)
                        I mean, that’s what “Al Ford” would 
                        do. You’re better than that.

           Ford glares at him, his finger still over the trigger. 

           Ford slowly lowers the crossbow and slides down the car in a 
           heap on the ground.
           Greta let’s out a sigh of relief. She looks down at Clinton. 

           Clinton takes look at his bloodied thigh, then at Greta.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 GRETA
                        I need your shirt.

           She pulls his shirt over his head and proceeds to tie it 
           around his leg. A makeshift tourniquet.

                                 CLINTON
                        Greta. I, uh...

                                 GRETA
                        Shhhh. Just rest your head.

           He looks her in the eyes.

                                 CLINTON
                        I’m sorry.

           WHOOP WHOOP. The distant sound of police sirens rings out.

           Greta rises to look at the flashing lights in the distance. 
           She looks back to Clinton.

           Clinton passes out. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Clinton comes to.

           A blurry FIGURE looms above him.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        God?

           The figure comes into focus -- Trevor, Clinton’s plucky kid 
           neighbor. He licks a popsicle. 

                                 TREVOR
                        Sucks. 

           Clinton grits his teeth in excruciating pain and woozily 
           looks at his blood-drenched hand. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Take care of my ma, Trevor. I’m not 
                        gonna make it. 
                                 OFFICER HOYLE (O.S.)
                        It’s a flesh wound, Clinton.

           Officer Hoyle emerges. He kneels over Clinton and smiles. He 
           pats Clinton on the shoulder.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna be fine, bud. 

           Two EMTs rush out of a nearby AMBULANCE and approach Clinton. 

           They ease him onto a back board and raise him onto a gurney. 

           As they wheel him toward the ambulance, Clinton looks around. 
           Greta is nowhere to be found.

           Ford sits in the back seat of HOYLE’S CRUISER. He peers out 
           the window at Clinton. There is a peculiar sense of peace 
           about him.

                                 CLINTON
                        I’ll give this one to you, Hoyle.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Shut up, Clinton. Someone get this 
                        guy to the hospital already.

           The EMTs push him into the ambulance.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           TITLE CARD: ONE MONTH LATER

           EXT. CLINTON’S HOUSE - MORNING 

           A MOVING TRUCK is parked out front. 

           With the aid of a CANE, Clinton emerges from the house, a bag 
           of clothes over his shoulder. He walks to the truck.

           Officer Hoyle emerges from the back.

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Hold on, let me get that for you.

                                 CLINTON
                        You know, I always sort of wanted 
                        to have a limp. 

           Clinton affects his limp into a confident swagger. 
                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Okay, take it easy there, Duke. 

                                 CLINTON
                        You’re just jealous cause I’m a 
                        better detective than you. 

           Officer Hoyle shakes his head and grabs the bag from him.

           Edie peers from the driver’s window. 

                                 EDIE
                        Are you kids ready?

           INT. MOVING TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           As they drive down the street, Officer Hoyle puts his arm 
           around Edie’s shoulder. 

           Clinton notices, then gazes out the window wistfully. We know 
           what he’s thinking about. 

                                 EDIE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Clinton, want some snacks for 
                        the new place?

           Clinton peers across the street. FORD’S MEGASTORE is gone. In 
           it’s place, a quaint strip mall under construction.

           EXT. STRIP MALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Edie leans out the window.

                                 EDIE
                        You sure you don’t want me to go in 
                        for you?

                                 CLINTON
                        I’m fine, ma. 

           Clinton hobbles across the parking lot. 

           On his way to a small grocer, Clinton notices an empty 
           storefront with a “For Rent” sign.

           He walks over and peers inside. 

           He takes a FLYER off the window and pockets it.

           Glancing up, he sees a pet store and groomers, PET-TASTIC.
           EXT. PET-TASTIC - MOMENTS LATER

           Clinton stands in front of the window.

           Inside, a KITTEN paws at the window. Clinton smiles and taps 
           back with his finger. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Hey, guy. What’s your name?

           The kitten opens it mouth in a silent meow behind the glass.

                                 GRETA (O.S.)
                            (gruff voice)
                        Bartleby.

           Clinton freezes. He notices Greta’s reflection in the glass.

                                 CLINTON
                        Ah, Bartleby. So, Bart, how’re 
                        things?

                                 GRETA (O.S.)
                        Same ol’ Same ol’. Life behind bars 
                        is rough, but I’m up for parole 
                        soon. 

           Clinton chuckles.

                                 CLINTON
                        So, uh, I know we just met, Bart, 
                        but I sort of miss you. 

           No answer.

           Clinton turns to face Greta. She wears a stylist’s smock.

                                 GRETA
                        Ditto.

                                 CLINTON
                        Is that you or Bartleby talking?

           She smiles.

                                 CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        So what’re you doing here?

           She gestures to Pet-Tastic. 

                                 GRETA
                        New job. I’m the head groomer. 
                                 CLINTON
                        Really?

                                 GRETA
                        Yeah, human hair was just too easy, 
                        but cutting fur, that’s an art.

                                 CLINTON
                        So, now you’re making pets 
                        respectable?

           She smiles.

                                 GRETA
                        How’d it work for you?

                                 CLINTON
                        I’m, uh, still trying.

           Greta looks up at the moving van in the distance.

                                 GRETA
                        Is that your mom with Hoyle?

                                 CLINTON
                        Yep. Can you believe it? They’re 
                        helping me move into my new place.

                                 GRETA
                        That’s great. Moving up in the 
                        world. 

           Clinton nods. Awkward silence. 

                                 GRETA (CONT’D)
                        I got a Vespa. Look. 

           She points out an old school maroon Vespa parked in the lot. 

                                 CLINTON
                        What’s its name, Ernest Borgnine?

                                 GRETA
                        No, its name is the GTS 250. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Oh. Well, it was nice seeing you 
                        again. 

           He waves awkwardly and starts to hobble away.

                                 GRETA
                        Hey. You wanna take a ride?
           Clinton turns.

                                 CLINTON
                        Don’t you have to...

           Clinton gestures to the salon. 

                                 GRETA
                        Yeah and I guess you’re moving. 

           A standstill. 

           INT. MOVING TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Edie and Officer Hoyle wait patiently. They suddenly glance 
           through the windshield. 

                                 EDIE
                        Clinton?

                                 OFFICER HOYLE
                        Sunovabitch. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           ANGLE ON: The kitten from the window, “Bartleby,” peers out 
           of a CAT CARRIER, wind blowing through its fur.

           We PULL OUT to see Clinton on the back of Greta’s Vespa, 
           holding onto the cage. Greta drives them across the lot.

           Wobbling for balance, Clinton tightly wraps his arms around 
           Greta. She smiles. 

           Greta turns out of the parking lot onto the main drag.

           We hold on them as they disappear down the street.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
