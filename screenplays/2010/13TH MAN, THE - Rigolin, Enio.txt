           TITLE OVER BLACK:

                                   December 11th, 1941

           Inspired by the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, Adolf 
           Hitler vows to deliver the horrors of war to the shores 
           of America.

                                     June 13th, 1942

           With virtually no experts in the field of espionage, the 
           U.S. Government recruits mathematicians, crossword 
           enthusiasts, pulp novelists, even comic book artists to 
           form the nation's first civilian intelligence agency, the 
           Office of Strategic Services, known today as the CIA.

                                     24 hours later

           German submarine U-202 surfaces off the coast of Long 
           Island, launching a team of Nazi Saboteurs armed with 
           explosives, fifty thousand dollars in cash, and a secret 
           mission to bring America to its knees.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. LONG ISLAND PIER - NIGHT

           A tin caricature of Adolf Hitler SNAPS to attention. POP! 
           The shot from a Sailor’s bee-bee rifle knocks it back 
           with a PING. 

           Flashing lights and MUSIC pour from the penny arcades as 
           Service Men and Women crowd the pier. 

           EXT. BEACH, ONE MILE DOWN SHORE - NIGHT

           A group of BOYS (6-9) lie beneath the boardwalk watching 
           a SOLDIER try to “woo” his Girl in the dark.

                                 SOLDIER
                        C’mon, Doll. Something to remember you 
                        by.

           The light of a COAST GUARDSMAN’s lamp washes over them. 

                                 COAST GUARDSMAN
                        Beach is closed.

           The couple run off. The boys hold their breath. 

           CLANK! The Guardsman turns with a start. Nothing but the 
           tide-breaker stretching out to sea. 
           CLANK - from the other side of the breaker wall. The 
           Guardsman goes to investigate. The boys all scamper, 
           except for one BEANIE-CAPPED BOY (6) whose curious gaze 
           follows the Guardsman up and over...

           THE TIDE-BREAKER WALL...

           Climbing over the breaker the Guardsman drops his lamp. 

                                 COAST GUARDSMAN (CONT’D)
                        Cripes.

           He gets down on his hands and knees, feels around the 
           sand, and finds his light - by a stack of wooden crates.

                                 HUSHED GERMAN (O.S.)
                        Vergrab’ die Uniformen mit den anderen 
                        Sachen. Die brauchen wir jetzt nicht 
                        mehr.

           The Guardsman turns on his flashlight to reveal... SIX 
           RAGGED-LOOKING MEN standing by the water.

                                 COAST GUARDSMAN
                        Beach is closed.

           The ragged men are too startled to speak. The Guardsman 
           approaches. Pauses. Some of them are only half dressed. 

                                 COAST GUARDSMAN (CONT’D)
                        You fellas been swimming or something?

           EXT. HARBOR WATERS, ALONG BREAKER WALL - SAME

           A SHADOWY FIGURE bursts from the choppy water. Hearing 
           VOICES towards the shore he slips back beneath the waves.

           EXT. HARBOR BEACH - SAME

           A ragged man in SPECTACLES steps forward.

                                 SPECTACLES
                                 (To Guardsman)
                        Hello, Officer. My companions and I were 
                        just out fishing when the time flew by 
                        and caught us in the darkness. 

           The Guardsman sees a rubber dinghy bobbing in the waves.

                                 SPECTACLES (CONT’D)
                        But we are quite alright now, thank you.

           The others nod. The Guardsman spots something in the sand 
           - by the SQUAT ONE’S feet - Some sort of uniform?
                                 SPECTACLES (CONT’D)
                        Yes. We are quite alright. 

           A tense beat. The Guardsman goes for his side-arm.

                                 SPECTACLES (CONT’D)
                        Nein!

           BANG!

           EXT. BREAKER WALL - SAME

           Hearing the shot, the Beanie-Capped Boy finishes his 
           climb up the breaker wall to see:

           A GERMAN U-BOAT drifting past. So close he can almost 
           touch it. As the Swastika comes into view the diesel 
           engines ROAR alive thrusting it out to sea.

           EXT. SHORELINE - SAME

           Smoke wafts from the Guardsman’s gun as his lifeless body 
           crumples to the sand. 

           CHRISTIAN WULFF - tall, chiseled, stoic - removes his 
           STILETTO SWITCHBLADE from the back of the Guardsman’s 
           neck and slips it beneath his wet-suit.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                                 (German, w/subtitles)
                        You. Hand me that rope. 

           They jump at the sound of his German. A TALL ragged man 
           hands him the rope.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                                 (German w/subtitles)
                        Unpack your supplies. Take what you need, 
                        bury what you don’t.

           Binding the Guardsmen’s feet with the rope, Christian 
           breaks into a flawless British accent.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        And for Christ’s sake, stop speaking 
                        German.

           They watch as Christian drags the body to the tree-line.

                                 SQUAT
                                 (German w/subtitles)
                        Who was that?
           EXT. TREE-LINE - NIGHT

           Shoving the body beneath a fallen tree, Christian leans 
           back... and freezes. The Beanie-Capped Boy sits crouched 
           atop the fallen tree, staring down at the dead Guardsman. 

                                 BEANIE-CAPPED BOY
                                 (Whisper)
                        Is he sleeping?

                                 CHRISTIAN 
                        Yes. So we’d best leave him be, or he’ll 
                        be cross. 

           Christian gently takes the Boy’s hand and leads him away.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        A bit late for a little man like you to 
                        be out and about. Where’s your mum?

                                 BEANIE BOY
                                 (Still whispering)
                        At work.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Ahh, at work. Tell me, does your mother 
                        take her car to work with her?

           EXT. NEWS STAND, WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

           THOMAS DOOLEY (early 20s), the embodiment of youthful 
           enthusiasm, adds two Hershey Bars and a toy tin soldier 
           to a stack of comic books on the counter. 

           Dooley pays for the items while scribbling in his trusty 
           sketch-book. By the looks of it he has a lot of thoughts-

           ...word puzzles, numeric equations, and lots and lots of 
           illustrations (aka comic-book art)...

           A street trolley RINGS past. Dooley grabs his items and 
           races after the trolley.

           EXT. AERIAL D.C. SKYLINE - DAY 

           The Trolley passes through DC’s German district where 
           shop windows advertise in German as well as English.

           INT. TROLLEY CAR - DAY 

           Dooley haggles with a group of German-American ten-year-
           olds over a German comic book titled “Die Abwehr” in the 
           back of the trolley. 
           He adds his American comics, the Hershey bars, and - just 
           to sweeten the deal - a Junior G-Man’s Lil’ Assistant’s 
           Badge to the pot.

           Unimpressed, the kid gives him a “hand-it-over” gesture. 
           Dooley SIGHS, peers over his shoulder and pulls a book of 
           Government Issue Gas Ration Stamps from his pocket.

           EXT. BICYCLE, MOVING - DAY

           Dooley weaves through traffic on a Schwinn Super Deluxe 
           Autocycle. Ignoring incoming traffic, he cuts across the 
           street - SKREEECH-HONK - and speeds through the gates 
           marked: “ARLINGTON HALL SCHOOL FOR GIRLS”.

           EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 

           Down a line of parked bicycles - SKREE - Dooley comes to 
           a stop, dismounts, and hoofs it across the manicured lawn 
           of an ivy-covered Sorority House. He slows to a jaunt as 
           two young ladies step out.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Ladies.

           He holds the door, tipping his hat, and steps inside.

           TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP-

           INT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

           A pair of dour-faced Receptionists bang away at their 
           typewriters at the end of the foyer.

           Dooley slips behind a punch-clock mounted on the wall. 
           Taking the toy soldier from his pocket, he peels the 
           cheap tin off its base revealing a fat magnet underneath.

           He raises the magnet to the punch-clock glass. As the 
           magnet’s force pulls the hour-hand back from “11” to “9”-
           CLUNK! Dooley punches his time-card and crosses into...

           THE PANTRY...

           Grabbing a small marble bust of President Roosevelt, 
           Dooley opens a dumbwaiter and places it inside. SKREEE. 
           Just heavy enough to drop the dumbwaiter down one floor.

           The TAPPING stops. Dooley turns to see the Receptionists 
           staring at him from their desks. Before he can speak, a 
           STAFF SERGEANT throws open a side door.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        Anyone seen Dooley?
           Before they can answer, Dooley’s hand emerges from behind 
           the door, unrolling a pair of silk stockings.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Not since he punched in two hours ago.

           With a scowl, the Staff Sergeant closes the door. The 
           stockings lay draped over the doorknob. The Receptionists 
           leap from their chairs for the stockings.

           Behind them, Dooley crosses the foyer to a bookshelf. He 
           grabs a book, opening a secret stairway and slips inside.

           INT. LOWER LEVEL HALLWAY - DAY

           As the Staff Sergeant marches past, Dooley emerges from 
           behind a pillar and heads for the dumbwaiter. With a 
           casual glance around he slips down the dumbwaiter shaft.

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           The dumbwaiter door pops open as Dooley emerges feet 
           first... just as a Uniformed Woman steps through a door. 
           Dooley holds it open for her and hands her the FDR bust.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Could you drop this off at reception for 
                        me? Thanks. 

           Dooley steps through the door and into...

           INT. CRYPTOGRAPHY ROOM, STATION X - DAY

           ...a huge windowless room bustling with activity. 

           TITLES: “US ARMY CRYPTOGRAPHY UNIT. CODE NAME: STATION X”

           Dooley passes the CHATTERING teletypes and SQUEALING 
           short-wave radios to a centralized group of elite young 
           Ivy-Leaguers... The Code-Breakers.

           Dooley’s eyes gravitate to one in particular... a Cool 
           Glass of Water in a Vassar cardigan. With her shapely 
           legs propped onto her desk and pencil between her teeth, 
           VASSAR reads from a German newspaper. 

                                 VASSAR
                        I need a twelve letter word for “ein 
                        taubes Raubtier ohne Beine”.

           A pomade-haired YALE man responds from his desk.

                                 YALE
                        A deaf, legless predator?
                                 VASSAR
                        What do you think?

                                 YALE
                        I think the enemy’s getting hard up for 
                        material.

           A four-eyed HARVARD man joins in.

                                 HARVARD
                        That or the editors of “Das Signal” need 
                        a new crossword writer.

           A teletype ALARM goes off. Yale rips out the page.

                                 HARVARD (CONT’D)
                        Run it through the key codes and see what 
                        comes up.

                                 VASSAR
                        Already did. The encryption has to be in 
                        the answer.

                                 HARVARD
                        A deaf predator with no legs? Doesn’t 
                        even make sense.

                                 VASSAR
                        That’s why it’s called a puzzle, genius.

           Dooley watches Yale as he seals the transmission in a 
           special envelope marked in red and drops it on his desk.

                                 YALE
                        Lucky number thirteen.

                                 VASSAR
                        You’re not even gonna try to decrypt it?

                                 HARVARD
                        He couldn’t crack the first twelve.

                                 YALE
                        It’s an Ultra. Without a machine it can’t 
                        be cracked.

                                 HARVARD
                        Spoken like a true Yale man.

           A HAND grabs Dooley by the collar and yanks him into...

           THE MAIL ROOM...
                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        Two hours late, Private? You realize 
                        there’s a war on, right? 

                                 DOOLEY
                        I don’t know, Sarge. Kinda hard to tell 
                        from the mail room.

           Dooley removes his coat revealing a Courier’s Uniform.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        Courier office. And I know plenty of 
                        Privates who’d kill to be state-side. 

           As the Sergeant reaches for a courier bag full of mail, 
           Dooley grabs a coat hanger and slips it down his pants.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Lemme know if any of ‘em wanna swap. You 
                        know my Pop was a pilot in the first war.

           Dooley replaces his fedora with a folded tent-cap.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        So, you get to fly a Schwinn. Every job 
                        is important. Besides, we can’t all be

                                 DOOLEY
                        You’re right. Some of us just have to 
                        fight for it.

           Dooley salutes his way out the door with his courier bag.

           INT. CRYPTOGRAPHY ROOM - DAY

           Dooley collects envelopes from designated bins. He spots 
           the Ultra envelope marked in red. Glancing at Yale, he 
           slips it into his bag and heads for the exit... failing 
           to notice Vassar who watches him in mild surprise.

           INT. MEN’S ROOM, TOILET STALL - DAY

           Dooley straightens the coat-hanger - slips it into the 
           unsealed gap along the top of the envelope - and winds. 

           Dooley removes the Ultra transmission neatly rolled 
           around the wire. He copies each encrypted word into his 
           sketch-book. A puzzled expression crosses his face. Huh.

           Dooley replaces the Ultra the same way he extracted it. 
           Stuffs the envelope back in his bag, and exits the stall 
           to find...
           ...the Code Breakers waiting for him, even Vassar.

                                 DOOLEY

                        He’s saying each comic book is a key code 
                        for each Ultra transmission. Issue one? 
                        Key code to Ultra transmission one. Issue 
                        two? Key code to Ultra transmission two.

                        It could mean a lot of things. But if I 
                        were to speculate? I’d say there’s an 
                        underground Network of German 
                        sympathizers operating within the United 
                        States. That they’re in direct contact 
                        with German high command. And that this 
                        Uncle Pastorius and his twelve “cousins” 
                        is code for an invasion of Nazi Agents 
                        sent to commit acts of sabotage on 
                        American soil.

           Dooley takes his comic books and walks out.

           INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           THUMP. THUMP. BADABADABADA-SMACK! Dooley spills out of 
           the dumbwaiter and onto the floor. Not so easy at night. 

           An MP behind a counter listens to the RADIO. As he lifts 
           his coffee off a newspaper, Dooley’s hand swipes past and 
           takes the newspaper, before the MP sets his coffee down.

           INT. STATION X - NIGHT

           Dooley slides the front page under the locked door of the 
           radio-room. From his pocket he pulls out a tennis ball 
           with a small hole cut along the surface. 
           Pressing the ball against the keyhole, Dooley squeezes -
           PSSSSST - forcing compressed air through the keyhole - 
           KLINK - blowing the key out from its hole on other side. 
           He pulls back the newspaper along with the key, when-

           GRRRR. Dooley looks up to see a German Shepherd sitting 
           right beside him - watching but not attacking. Dooley 
           follows the dog’s eye-line down to... the tennis ball in 
           his hand. Dooley holds it up. She wags her tail. Gently, 
           he lobs it across the room. The dog bolts after it. 
           Dooley unlocks the door and enters...

           INT. RADIO ROOM - NIGHT

           Dooley approaches a short-wave radio, opens his sketch-
           book and reaches for the power switch when... ZZZZZZZZZ. 
           He spots an MP asleep in a chair just a few feet away.

           Ever so gently, Dooley places a radio headset over the 
           MP’s ears. Then returns to his radio and flips it on.

           INT. STATION X - DAY

           TWO MEN in GREY SUITS enter the bustling code room. SLAM! 
           The Code Breakers turn with a start...

                        Who’s Dooley?

           As if on cue, Dooley stumbles out of the mail-room and 
           freezes. Everyone is looking at him.

                                 DOOLEY
                        What?

           Beyond the DC skyline... over the rolling hills of 
           Arlington National Cemetery... a grey sedan speeds down a 
           dirt road surrounded by swampland. 

           INT. GREY SEDAN, MOVING - SAME

           Dooley in the back of the grey sedan, his sketch-book 
           clutched to his chest.

           Armed Marines wave the grey sedan past security and up a

           They march Dooley down a long hallway.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Okay, I’m guessing you fellas aren’t with 
                        the FBI. So before we go any further, let 
                        me explain. My little radio experiment 
                        wasn’t so much about contacting the enemy 
                        as proving a point about probability. 
                        Either of you fellas read Dick Tracy?

           Man In Grey 1 halts by a door. Dooley flinches to a stop.

                                 MAN IN GREY 1
                        Private? What’s your clearance level?

           He opens the door.

           INT. DARK OFFICE - DAY

           Dooley enters the dimly lit room. The door SLAMS behind 
           him. Before his eyes can adjust, his ears are drawn to 
           the sound of WHISTLING...

           A DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING GENTLEMAN (30s), sits by a 
           curtained window reading a file marked “CONFIDENTIAL”. 

           Dooley moves close enough to make out the name on the 
           file: “DOOLEY, THOMAS”. He stifles a WHIMPER. The 
           Gentleman continues to read and WHISTLE as if Dooley 
           weren’t there. Dooley glances around the room to...

           A huge desk lined with phones. The last one on the end, 
           an ominous red. On the wall, a PORTRAIT OF A COWBOY with 
           a handlebar mustache. The engraving reads: “Wild Bill”.

           The WHISTLING stops. Dooley turns to see the Gentleman 
           eyeing him over his file. He gives Dooley a wink.

                                 HUSKY VOICE (O.C.)
                        There was this Sergeant in the Union Army-

           Dooley spins to a Bullish Man in uniform across the room. 
           GENERAL “WILD BILL” DONOVAN (40s) approaches Dooley.

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        -whose assignment it was to protect the 
                        President at the end of the war. On that 
                        fateful night when John Wilkes Booth shot 
                        Mr. Lincoln in the back of the head, that 
                        Sergeant supposedly found a note in the 
                        President’s pocket. Know what was on it?

                                 DOOLEY
                        His dismissal papers?

           The Gentleman CHUCKLES from his chair. Donovan does not.

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        A list of death threats the President 
                        planned on having investigated once he 
                        found the time. History’s littered with 
                        tragedies that could’ve been averted if 
                        someone had just followed up on all the 
                        leads. Even the crazy ones.

                                 DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN
                        Especially the crazy ones.

           Dooley is taken aback by the Gentleman’s British accent.
                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        How did you know those German comics were 
                        key codes?

                                 DOOLEY 
                        I didn’t. I was just speculating.

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        Just speculating.

           Donovan looks to the Gentleman, who glances over the file 
           once more: “...academic underachiever ...hyperactive 
           behavior ...IQ score: 160.” The “160” is circled in red. 

           He closes the file and gives Donovan a nod.

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN (CONT’D)
                        Quite a story, the one about Lincoln, 
                        isn’t it? Want to hear another? Hitler 
                        sends a U-boat across the Atlantic 
                        dropping a team of German operatives off 
                        the coast of Long Island. The operatives 
                        kill a coast guardsman, bury a stockpile 
                        of cash, uniforms, and weapons then 
                        disappear. Tell me, in your opinion, 
                        where would these German operatives be 
                        going? For what purpose? And how would 
                        they get there?

           Dooley LAUGHS. They don’t. Dooley grips his sketch-book.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Well, what do your experts on German 
                        intelligence-

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        What if I told you we had no experts on 
                        German intelligence. Aside from my friend 
                        Admiral Fleming here.

           The Gentleman, ADMIRAL FLEMING, extends his hand.

                                 FLEMING
                        Call me Ian.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Dooley. Thomas Dooley.

           Fleming pauses... rather liking the sound of that.

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        Go ahead, Private... speculate.
                                 DOOLEY
                        Well, if I were to speculate... I’d say 
                        their first objective is obvious-

           Dooley scribbles a word at the top of a blank page...

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Transportation.

           INT. TRAIN STATION, TICKET LINE - THREE DAYS EARLIER

           Squat opens a briefcase, takes out a fist-full of CASH...

                                 DOOLEY (V.O.)
                        They’d have to get as far from the 
                        landing site as quickly as possible. 
                        Probably by bus or train...

           The CASH is passed up the line of ragged hands to 
           Spectacles, who pays for six tickets.

                                 DOOLEY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But if they’re smart...

           CHRISTIAN’S STEELY GAZE...

                                 DOOLEY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...they’d know how to travel alone.

           INT. MODEL-A FORD, MOVING - THREE DAYS EARLIER

           Christian, now dressed in a fashionable white suit and 
           fedora, drives a hot-wired Ford down an old country road. 

                                 DOOLEY (V.O.)
                        The Army tells you training is the key to 
                        survival. But for a spy behind enemy 
                        lines, it’s all about improvisation.

           STEAM bursts from under the hood fogging the windshield. 
           Christian checks the gauge. The needle dances on “HOT”.

           EXT. COUNTRY GAS STATION - THREE DAYS EARLIER

           Christian strolls out of the gas station, sizing up the 
           other cars and their drivers.

                                 DOOLEY (V.O.)
                        For the professional, any obstacle short 
                        of exposure is never a deterrent. 

           Christian spots two teenage girls in a RED BUICK 
           CONVERTIBLE giving their best “come hither” looks before 
           bursting into GIGGLES. 
                                 DOOLEY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        For the professional...

           Christian lights a Chesterfield cigarette and smiles.

                                 DOOLEY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...it’s an opportunity.

           INT. GENERAL DONOVAN’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Dooley’s audience has grown to include the Men In Grey 
           and the General’s No-Nonsense Secretary who takes notes. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        There are two types of German spy. Those 
                        trained by the Abwehr, a relic of an 
                        agency considered unreliable and 
                        amateurish even by its own leaders. 

           Dooley draws in his sketch-book as he talks. He’s 
           literally sketching out key moments in the action, like 
           panels in a comic book...

           ... Shadowy Agents boarding a train... Nimble fingers hot-
           wiring a car... A faceless man standing over a dead body, 
           switchblade in hand...

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        And then there’s the SS...

           RIP!

           EXT. WOODS - THREE DAYS EARLIER

           Christian yanks the last strip of tape off the Buick, now 
           shiny white instead of glossy red.

                                 DOOLEY (V.O.)
                        ...Hitler’s own security force of highly 
                        trained killers. If our Germans are 
                        Abwehr, they’re still a threat. But if 
                        just one of them were SS...

           Christian tosses the tape, empty paint cans, and used 
           brushes into the trunk... 

                                 DOOLEY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...God help anyone who crosses his path.

           ...next to TWO TARP-WRAPPED BODIES stuffed in the back. 
           Christian SLAMS the trunk and breaks off the handle.

                                 GRUFF VOICE (V.O.)
                        Ehem!
           INT. PENTAGON BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           Dooley now stands at a podium before a long table of 
           GENERALS, CABINET MEMBERS and AGENCY CHIEFS. A man in a 
           HOOVER-BLUE jacket and tie speaks up.

                                 HOOVER BLUE
                        So what’s the target?

           SHRIEEEEEEEKK! 

           INT. CHRISTIAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Christian pours himself a cup of hot tea - SHIFFFTH - 
           Sticks his stiletto into the sole of his shoe - CLICK - 
           and swivels out the heel to reveal a HIDDEN COMPARTMENT.

                                 DOOLEY (V.O.)
                        The target...?

           Christian removes Three Blank Strips of Paper the size of 
           his pinkie... and lays them in the tea saucer.

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           Dooley stares down at the last panel in his Sketch-
           book... blank, with a big question mark underneath.

                                 DOOLEY
                        ...has yet to be determined.

           INT. CHRISTIAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Christian watches as the tea activates the FIRST of THREE 
           SECRET MESSAGES written in INVISIBLE INK... 

           MESSAGE 1 reads: “720 East 86th Street.”

                                 HOOVER BLUE (PRELAP)
                        I’m confused...

           INT. PENTAGON BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           TITLE CARD: “TWO WEEKS LATER”.

                                 HOOVER BLUE
                        How exactly did you come up with these 
                        theories, Private Dooley, is it?

           Dooley pauses. Fleming looks to Donovan. Who is this guy?

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        Hoover-boys. Here to protect and serve 
                        their own interests.
                                 FLEMING
                        Smashing.

                                 HOOVER BLUE
                        You apprehended any of these German 
                        sympathizers? Interrogated them?

                                 DOOLEY
                        No, our information’s based on-

                                 HOOVER BLUE
                        On what? Fragmented radio intercepts?

           A stern little man at the end of the table, the WAR 
           SECRETARY, chimes in.

                                 WAR SECRETARY
                        I believe what Special Agent Conrad is 
                        trying to discern, Private, is how much 
                        of this is based on fact and how much is 
                        just speculation.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Thank you, Mr. Secretary. That’s exactly 
                        what I’m trying to discern. Because I for 
                        one find it hard to believe that a team 
                        of German spies would cross the Atlantic 
                        under stealth of submarine, only to 
                        announce their arrival by leaving their 
                        uniforms along the shore for us to find.

                                 WAR SECRETARY
                        And how would the FBI explain it?

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        As a hoax, Mr. Secretary. Scare tactics 
                        used by communist sympathizers to 
                        distract us from the real threat.

                                 DOOLEY
                        That’s funny. Last I checked we were at 
                        war with fascism not communis-

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        What are your credentials, Private?

           As if on cue, a Younger Hoover-Blue hands Conrad a file. 
           Fleming stiffen recognizing the file.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        Because according to our files the 
                        closest you’ve ever come to police work 
                        would be your stint as a copy boy at your 
                        hometown paper, the Pioneer Press. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        A job you held for six months, between 
                        dropping out of high school and enlisting 
                        in the Army where you served as a bicycle 
                        messenger for the Signal Corp. Isn’t that 
                        right? Assuming none of that’s top secret 
                        information.

                                 DOOLEY
                        No, that’s right. Except for my being 
                        just a copy boy.

                                 AGENT CONRAD 
                        No, no. You also wrote crossword puzzles. 
                        And something else called- the Green 
                        Ghost? What kind of writing is that?

                                 DOOLEY
                        A comic strip, about a federal agent.

           The War Secretary arches his brow. The room falls silent.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        And that, gentlemen, is what we at the 
                        Bureau call “self-incrimination”.

           LAUGHTER breaks the silence. Conrad smiles across the 
           table at Fleming and Donovan. But the two don’t seem 
           fazed. Conrad looks over the file one last time. He spots 
           the IQ score of “160” circled in red. His grin falters.

                                 DOOLEY
                        You’re right.

           All eyes turn back to Dooley.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        About the uniforms, I mean. They landed 
                        in uniform in order to incriminate 
                        themselves.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Thank you, Priv-

                                 DOOLEY
                        Because according to law an enemy 
                        combatant cannot be tried or executed so 
                        long as he’s considered a legitimate 
                        soldier of a recognized state.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        So?
                                 DOOLEY
                        So if the Germans landed in uniform and 
                        were caught, they’d be protected by the 
                        Geneva Convention as prisoners of war. 
                        But if they landed out of uniform and got 
                        caught... well, there’s nothing on the 
                        books about the rights of a spy. 

           Fleming smiles across the table at Agent Conrad.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Once they saw the coast was clear, they 
                        just buried their uniforms in the sand, 
                        turning soldier into spy. The fact that 
                        the tide uncovered the evidence was just 
                        luck. They should’ve dug deeper.

                                 WAR SECRETARY 
                        Get all that from a comic strip as well?

                                 DOOLEY

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Well the next time the FBI needs advice 
                        we’ll just give Captain America a call.

                                 DOOLEY
                        You mean Stan Lee.

           Conrad gives Dooley a blank stare.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        The kid who writes Captain America. You 
                        could call him for advice, but you’d have 
                        to clear it with the War Secretary first. 
                        Seeing as he currently works for Signal 
                        Corps’ Propaganda Department. Assuming 
                        none of that’s top secret information.

           All eyes turn to the War Secretary... who cracks a smile.

           The smoke-filled room swings with BIG BAND MUSIC as 
           servicemen jitter-bug with USO girls. 

           EXT. DANCE HALL, ROCKEFELLER CENTER - NIGHT

           A huge BOUNCER squeezed into a tuxedo stands before a 
           line of SAILORS eager to enter.  
                                 SAILOR 1
                        Come on, Chuckie. I got a girl in there

                                 BOUNCER
                        Yeah, you and the rest of the fleet.

           An EAR-SHATTERING BLAST as the building explodes, 
           engulfing the sidewalk and its Inhabitants in flames.

           INT. PENTAGON HALLWAY - DAY

           Donovan and Fleming march down the hall. Dooley follows, 
           reading over the situation report.

                        The type of explosive has yet to be 
                        determined. But from the looks of it, I’d 
                        say it was a homemade concoction. A 
                        hydrochlorine or nitroglycerine.

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        Officially this incident was the result 
                        of a gas leak. Meaning keep it under your 
                        Stetson, Private. The President doesn’t 
                        want a panic, he wants it resolved.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Do we keep tabs on commercial inventory? 
                        General stores, pharmacies, any place 
                        that might sell cleaning supplies?

                                 FLEMING
                        Why do you ask?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Takes a lot of sauce to blow a space that 
                        big. If they were careless enough to buy 
                        all their ingredients from the same place-

           Fleming and Donovan stop. Dooley continues down the hall, 
           drawing it all out in his sketch-book.

                                 FLEMING
                        Looks like we bet on the right horse.

           EXT. TENEMENT BLOCK, UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY 

           Immigrant children play along the cobblestone as 
           Christian approaches the building address. He compares it 
           with the address on the slip of paper in his hand... 
           Invisible Ink Message #1.
           INT. WEAPONS ROOM, 15TH FLOOR- DAY

           A KEY RATTLE unlocks an apartment door as a DAPPER YOUNG 
           MAN leads Christian into the room. A variety of pistols, 
           rifles, grenades, and knives line the walls. Just enough 
           weaponry for an Underground resistance group. 

                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN
                        There she is.

           Among the weapons, Christian spots a BROWN LEATHER CASE.

                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
                        Wasn’t easy getting hold of, I can tell 
                        you that. 

           Christian approaches the case, triggers the latches and 
           opens the front. He scrutinizes the contents within.

                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
                        Even considered having one built. I mean 
                        you can’t just walk down the street with 
                        one of these babies... eay, Herr Wulff? 

           Christian bristles at the Young Man’s German inflection.

                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t imagine the Network would risk 
                        this unless it was for something 
                        important? Something really big?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Did you say you attend University?

                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN
                        Princeton, actually.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Plan to graduate?

                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN
                        Not much of a plan if you don’t graduate.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Then stop asking questions, maybe you 
                        will.

           The Young Man’s smirk fades.

           EXT. EXPRESSWAY - DAY

           A fleet of signature Black FBI Sedans race towards the 
           New York skyline. 
           INT. BLACK SEDAN, MOVING - DAY

           Conrad unlocks the glove box to reveal... A rack of .45 
           automatics. He issues one to Armstrong, one to McCord, 
           and one for himself. Dooley eyes the box expectantly.

                                 DOOLEY
                        I think I left my piece back at the 
                        office. How about a loaner there, Chief?

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Presidential order 9182: Agents of the 
                        OSS may collect and analyze intelligence 
                        for foreign operations only. Operating 
                        beyond these duties on domestic soil is 
                        prohibited and punishable by law.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Sooo... no gun?

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Until the targets are neutralized, and 
                        the site’s secure, your ass waits in the 
                        car.

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - DAY

           The SOUND of playing children drifting through the window 
           comes to an unnatural halt. Christian notices.

                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN
                        Something wrong?

           Christian peers out the window. The streets are empty. 
           The children are gone. Nothing but two- no, four black 
           sedans at each corner! 

           Christian takes the brown leather case by the handle. On 
           impulse, grabs a 9mm handgun and slips it in his pocket.

                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        My other contacts, do you know them?

                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN
                        Of course.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Can you reach them by telephone? Identify 
                        them by sight?
                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN
                        I have a photographic memory. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Open the door.

           The Young Man fumbles for his keys. 

                                 DAPPER YOUNG MAN
                        Wouldn’t contacting the others be risky?

           Christian triggers the blade of his stiletto...

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        It certainly would.

           SPLIIICH! Pulling him back onto the point of his knife.

           INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY, 15TH FLOOR - DAY 

           Conrad leads a Team down the hall. Armstrong and McCord 
           lead another. The two converge on a door in the center.

           An Old Woman peeks out her apartment door. Conrad raises 
           a finger to his lips. She closes it MUMBLING in GERMAN. 

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - SAME

           Christian climbs out the window facing the alleyway to...

           ALLEYWAY FIRE ESCAPE...

           He freezes as FBI Agents enter the alley directly below.

           INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - SAME

           Conrad nods to Armstrong who - SMASH - kicks in the door!

           INT. SABOTEUR’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Four Ragged Men leap to their feet.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Federal officers! Reach for the sky!

                                 SPECTACLES
                        Don’t shoot! Don’t Shoot!

                                 AGENT ARMSTRONG
                        He said hands in the air!

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        Do it now!
           Arms raised, the THIRD and FOURTH MEN eye handguns just 
           out of reach. Behind the Agents... across the hall... 
           through the weapon room door... and out the window to... 

           ALLEYWAY FIRE ESCAPE...

           Christian searches for an out. The fire escape along the 
           adjacent building. 10 feet away, across a 15 story drop.

           INT. SABOTEUR’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - SAME

           The last two men, TALL and SQUAT scurry out the window to 
           a front fire escape, leaving a tub of chemicals behind.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY FIRE ESCAPE - SAME

           As the last FBI Man turns the corner, Christian leaps 
           onto the railing and jumps...

           ...across the gap between buildings... 

           ...landing on the adjacent fire escape with a CRASH!! 
           Glass shatters as the platform buckles under his weight. 

           INT. SABOTEUR’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Conrad moves in on the saboteurs...

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Hands where we can see ‘em!

                                 SPECTACLES
                        Just don’t shoot-

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        Shut up!

           CRUNCH! Conrad looks down at the glass beneath his shoe. 
           White powder covers the floor. The same powder on their 
           raised hands. Empty ammonia containers - tubs of ice 
           water - and a table of corked bottles of clear liquid.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Hold your fire! Nitro! Nitro!

           The Third and Fourth Men reach for the guns... 

                                 SPECTACLES
                        No!

           ...and open fire. The Agents take cover and return fire. 
           EXT. FIRE ESCAPE, ADJACENT BUILDING - SAME

           With the brown leather case still in hand, Christian 
           climbs off the shaky fire escape, through the broken 
           window, and into the stairwell of the adjacent building.

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - SAME

           Dooley finishes a less than flattering portrait of Agent 
           Conrad in his sketch-book, when... He sees Tall and Squat 
           scrambling down the fire escape. 

           Dooley scans the streets for Agents. No one in sight. He 
           turns to the glove box. The key still sits in the lock.

           INT. SABOTEUR’S APARTMENT - SAME

           The corked nitro bottles tremble amidst the GUNFIRE.

                                 SPECTACLES
                        Stop! Stop! Stop!

           He shouts from behind a sofa where Second Ragged Man lies 
           dead. The Third Man’s gun CLICKS empty. Conrad throws 
           himself over a table and BAM! The Third Man falls.

           With a SCREAM, the Fourth Man leaps out SHOOTING. The 
           Agents UNLOAD sending him back towards the nitro. He 
           teeters, hits the floor, and jars a bottle over the edge.

                        AGENT CONRAD
                                                      SPECTACLES
           Noooo!
                                             Noooo!

           Armstrong and Spectacles dive for the bottle. They 
           collide, sending it high into the air. The room watches 
           in silence as... Conrad slides under the bottle, cupping 
           it in his hand, twisting in its direction of travel, and 
           lowers it to the floor. SPLOOP. The entire room breathes.

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        Well that was a barrel of laughs.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

           Dooley enters the alley with a .45 in both hands. CLANK - 
           From the far end of the alley. Dooley moves in.

           INT. ADJACENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL - SAME

           Christian slips down the stairs past looky-loo tenants.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY 

           Dooley nervously inches towards a row of garbage cans.
           INT. ADJACENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL - DAY

           Christian reaches the lobby and halts. Uniformed police 
           by the entrance block anxious tenants from leaving. He 
           ducks back into the stairwell, and spots a back door.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY 

           Dooley nervously approaches the garbage cans, when - CA-
           CLUNK - a door flies open behind him. Dooley spins...

           Christian halts. Dooley’s .45 aimed right in his face. 
           Dooley takes in Christian’s clean-shaven face, nice suit, 
           and brown leather briefcase. Wrong building. Wrong man. 

           Christian watches amazed as Dooley lowers his gun and 
           raises a finger to his lips. CRASH! Tall and Squat bolt 
           from the trash cans to the corner. Dooley gives chase. 

           Christian calmly heads in the other direction.

           EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY

           Tall and Squat burst from the alley and into the street. 
           SCREECH-HOOOONK! Drawing the attention of TWO MOUNTED 
           POLICEMEN across the road. 

           Dooley bolts from the alley and into the street.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Hal-

           SCREECH!! Dooley leaps back as a truck hits its breaks. 
           Tall and Squat see the Mounted Police closing in.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Halt! Stehen bleiben! Hände hoch!

           Tall raises his hands in defeat.

                                 TALL
                                 (German w/subtitles)
                        That’s it. It’s over.

           Squat pulls out a corked bottle of clear liquid.

                                 SQUAT
                        Für das Vaterland.

                                 TALL
                        Nein!

           FWOOOOOOOM! SILENCE as the air is sucked into the center 
           of a BLINDING LIGHT, then... BAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMM!!!
           Spat back out with the EAR-SHATTERING BLAST of HOT WHITE 
           CHEMICAL FIRE. The Saboteurs and Mounted Police are 
           incinerated. The SHOCK WAVE knocks cars up over the curb, 
           and Dooley off his feet and into the building behind him.

           Wounded Civilians CRY OUT. Distant SIRENS WHINE. Dooley 
           opens his eyes, taking in the devastation.

           INT. SABOTEUR’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Agents sweep the apartment collecting evidence as Conrad, 
           Armstrong and McCord flip through a pile of maps.

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        Aluminium factories in Illinois. 
                        Magnesium plants in Philadelphia. Water 
                        locks, rail lines... they even got 
                        blueprints to Niagara water and power.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        They were gonna blow Niagara falls?

                                 AGENT ARMSTRONG
                        Taking half the eastern seaboard off the 
                        grid. We’re lucky all they got was a USO.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        So, where’s this building manager?

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - SAME

           FLASH - Dooley blinks as the FBI take photos of the body. 
           He spots the knife wound barely visible below his skull.

           FLASH - Ignoring the arsenal of weapons, Dooley focuses 
           on a dust-free area where the leather case once sat. 

           A breeze blows something off the fire escape. Two Small 
           Strips of Paper. Christian’s Invisible Ink Messages!

           Message 1:“720 East 86th Street.” Message 2: No letters. 
           No numbers. Just an odd little icon of a Blue Lion. 
           THWACK! Conrad’s fist knocks Dooley to the floor.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        You wanna play G-Man? Be a hero like in 
                        the funny-papers? This is the FBI. You 
                        disregard my orders, and I’ll see you 
                        buried under the goddamn jail!

                                 DOOLEY
                        If I followed your orders, we’d still 
                        have two saboteurs on the loose.
           Conrad moves in for another punch.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        But you’re right...

           Dooley pulls out the .45. The room of Agents freeze. 
           Dooley flips the gun over and offers him the handle.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        I should’ve stayed in the car. At least 
                        those policemen would still be alive.

           The tension breaks as a BURLY AGENT emerges from a door.

                                 BURLY AGENT
                        Someone get the head office on the line. 
                        You’re not gonna believe this one.

           Behind the Burly Agent, Dooley sees Spectacles sitting 
           interrogation style. His face a mix of shame and relief. 

           EXT. FLORIDA HARBOR - NIGHT

           TITLES: “June 17th, 1942. Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida”

           SIX GERMAN SOLDIERS emerge from the water. They scan the 
           beach for signs of life.  

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                                 (German w/subtitles)
                        The coast is clear. We’re safe.

           FWOOM! FLOOD LIGHTS illuminate the shore. They cover 
           their eyes as ARMED FROGMEN burst from the shallows.

           EXT. HARBOR - SAME

           As German submarine U-584 races for the mouth of the 
           harbor... a K-74 HYDROGEN AIRSHIP emerges from the fog. 
           The Deck Officer atop the U-boat SCREAMS down the hatch.

                                 U-BOAT DECK OFFICER
                        Luftschiff!! Luftschiff!! 

           BA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA! The Airship’s .50 caliber rounds 
           rip across the U-boat’s bow, taking out the Deck Officer. 
           The U-boat dives. The airship banks hard to starboard, 
           releasing Depth Charges across the narrow harbor mouth.

           BENEATH THE WAVES...

           EXPLOSIONS all around the U-boat until - CLANK - A direct 
           hit. BLAAAMMM!! The hull implodes like a tin can on fire.

                        Hoover and his trusty G-men do it again! 
                        After months of surveillance, the FBI 
                        rounded up a team of Nazi saboteurs who 
                        landed by U-boat, armed with an insidious 
                        plot to strike the American heartland. 
                        Only Hitler didn’t count on the skill and 
                        perseverance of J. Edgar Hoover and the 
                        FBI, tirelessly working to protect our 
                        shores from foreign invaders. Let their 
                        fate be a warning to all enemies foreign 
                        and domestic, don’t mess with the FBI.

           J. Edgar Hoover smiles proudly for the camera.

           INT. GENERAL DONOVAN’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Dooley slaps his sketch-book onto the General’s desk.

                                 DOOLEY
                        It’s a diversion.

           Donovan sits back. Fleming picks up the sketch-book.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        One Government with two intelligence 
                        agencies? That’s not covering your bases. 
                        It’s a recipe for disaster.

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        If you think the FBI and OSS will settle 
                        their differences just to win a war-

                                 FLEMING
                        He’s not talking about us, Bill. He’s 
                        talking about the Germans.

           Fleming reveals a sketch-book drawing of two opposing 
           seals: The “SS” versus the “Abwehr”.

                                 DOOLEY
                        The FBI may hate us. Really hate us. But 
                        it’s nothing compared to the derision 
                        between the Abwehr and the SS. They don’t 
                        share intelligence, they don’t engage in 
                        joint operations, and they don’t share 
                        codes.
           Dooley slaps the 13th Ultra onto the desk.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        The thirteenth Ultra. The only Abwehr 
                        transmission I have yet to crack. Why?

                                 FLEMING
                        The Abwehr didn’t send it. The SS did.

                                 DOOLEY
                        When the FBI interrogated that Abwehr 
                        agent, they ignored one crucial thing... 
                        Why would he admit to blowing up a USO, 
                        murdering hundreds, only to deny the 
                        killing of a single coast guard, claiming 
                        it was someone else? Some mystery man in 
                        a wet-suit and a stiletto switchblade?

                                 FLEMING
                        An SS agent.

                                 DOOLEY
                        On a mission of his own.

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        Alright. Say there is an SS operative on 
                        American soil. What do you plan to do 
                        about it?

                                 DOOLEY
                        First we have to convince the FBI-

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        I’m not asking what the FBI would do. I’m 
                        asking what you’re going to do?

                                 DOOLEY
                        I thought the OSS was restricted from 
                        domestic operations?

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        Officially, yes.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Officially?

                                 FLEMING
                        Yes.

           Beat.

                                 DOOLEY
                        You want I should find him on my own? But 
                        I’d be breaking the law.
                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        We didn’t recruit you because you respect it.

           The possibilities flash before Dooley’s eyes.

           Skipping the front page, Christian turns to a smaller 
           story on page 2 titled: “ENRICO FERMI OFFERED TENURE”

                                 TESS (O.C.)
                        I’m sorry, I must have left my cash in my 
                        other purse.

           Christian looks up from the back of a line of customers 
           to see a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN at the counter, scouring 
           her purse for change. This is TESS (20s).

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        So stupid of me-

                                 DRUGGIST
                        Why don’t you just come back when you 
                        have it.

                                 TESS
                        Oh, but if I can just find enough 
                        change... here’s a penny.

           The line of Customers GROAN. Christian is about to return 
           to his paper when he notices the laminated ID clipped to 
           her jacket... bearing an emblem of a Blue Lion.

                                 DRUGGIST
                        I’m sorry, Miss, but I’m going to have to 
                        ask you to step aside.

                                 TESS
                        Couldn’t we just put it on credit?

                                 DRUGGIST
                        That’s not our policy. Now if you’ll just 
                        step aside.
                                 TESS
                        You don’t understand. I need this for my-

                                 DRUGGIST
                        Then come back with the amount it costs. 
                        Now step-

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        That won’t be necessary. 

           Christian sets his items, magazines and newspapers, on 
           the counter with hers.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        The lady’s clearly an honest woman. Just 
                        include her expenses with mine, and we’ll 
                        call the matter settled. 

           Both Tess and the Druggist stare at him in shock.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Or do you have a policy against human 
                        decency as well?

           The Druggist cowers back behind the register. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Allow me to apologize for the lesser 
                        members of my sex.

                                 TESS
                        Huh?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Nothing breeds contempt like a man faced 
                        with a beauty beyond his station.

           Tess blinks.

                                 DRUGGIST
                        That’ll be eight dollars.

           Christian pays the Druggist, eyeing her ID badge.

                                 TESS
                        Ha! Wow. I... Thank you. I can’t imagine 
                        how this must look. So embarrassing... I 
                        admit I can be a bit of a scatter-brain, 
                        but a damsel in distress? Do you have a 
                        phone? I don’t have a phone. But I can 
                        give you my address so you can-

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Take you to dinner?
           Once again, Tess is left speechless. Christian smiles.

           BAM-BA-BA-BAM-BAM-BA-BAM!!

                        Aren’t you gonna teach me how to shoot? 

                                 FLEMING
                        If you had to choose just one weapon for 
                        this mission, would it really be a gun?

                                 DOOLEY
                        The FBI seem to think so.

                                 FLEMING
                        Careful who you put your faith in. Those 
                        Hoover-boys are loyal to just one man, 
                        and it’s not the President.  

           INT. COMBAT ROOM - DAY

           A room full of OSS Agents practice hand to hand combat.

                                 FLEMING
                        When it comes to the art of evasion 
                        you’re a natural. But eventually everyone 
                        gets caught. And when that happens you’ll 
                        need to know how to subdue your opponent.

                                 DOOLEY
                        There are eight pressure points on the 
                        body that can render a man unconscious.

                                 FLEMING 
                        Really? What are they?

                                 DOOLEY
                        The sciatic nerve below the kidney. The 
                        temporal artery above-

           Fleming kicks him in the groin and knees him in the head.

                                 FLEMING
                        Basics, my boy. Don’t over think it.
           INT. COMBAT ROOM - LATER

           THWACK-THUMP-SMACK- Dooley stumbles through a series of 
           self-defence exercises with a gang of armed OSS Trainers.

                                 FLEMING
                        Clandestine is latin for stealth. A real 
                        spy can take a man twice his size, in a 
                        crowded room, without firing a shot...

           Fleming takes Dooley down hard.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        ...or spilling his martini.

           CLICK-ICK. Fleming looks down to see a gun pointed at his 
           crotch. An OSS Trainer checks to find his holster empty.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Or I could just shoot him.

           BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM!!

           EXT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

           Fleming watches Dooley unload on the distant target.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Thaaaaat’s the ticket! Not bad, eah

                                 FLEMING
                        Yes, well shooting is all about 
                        technique. Killing on the other hand...

           Fleming adjusts Dooley’s aim from the target to an OSS

                        ...is all about desire. You have to want 
                        to take a man’s life. Or at least have no 
                        reservations about doing so.

           Fleming cocks the hammer on the gun. Dooley stares at the 
           innocent man in his sights... and uncocks the hammer.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        Until you’re ready to do that, training 
                        won’t make a bit of difference.

           Fleming takes the gun from his hand.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        You worry about finding him. Let us worry 
                        about taking him down. 
                                 DOOLEY
                        I already know how to find him. 

           Dooley opens his Sketch-Book revealing Christian’s 
           invisible ink messages taped to the page. 

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Just follow the blue lion.

           Students cross the field doubling as the University Quad.

           INT. COLUMBIA PHYSICAL PLANT, RECORDS ROOM - DAY

           A PLATINUM BLONDE unrolls a blueprint across the counter 
           before Christian. 

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE
                        There ya go. Blueprints to the entire 
                        campus proper.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        These plans, they’ve been updated?

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE
                        Been a lot of construction since the war 
                        started.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Including security, I see.

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE
                        So Secret Service, huh? Didn’t realize 
                        there were British Secret Service agents.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        MI6 actually. On assignment with the 
                        Secret Service. All top secret, of 
                        course.

           He winks. She smiles.

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE
                        My lips are sealed. 
                                 CHRISTIAN
                        These security locks, how exactly would 
                        one gain access-

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE
                        With a special clearance ID.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Like this one?

           He holds up Tess’ ID, covering her name with his finger.

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE
                        That one might get you into the library. 
                        Anywhere else? 

           She flips a page in the blueprints.

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE (CONT’D)
                        You’ll need one of these.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        An FGP ID?

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE
                        For Federal Government Employees only. 
                        Professors, scientists, university 
                        bigwigs. Anyone whose work gets funded by 
                        the War Department. It’s a small list.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        So with the right FGP ID one would have 
                        access to any building on campus. Even 
                        the quad?

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE
                        With the right FGP ID you could stroll 
                        through the ladies room and not raise an 
                        eyebrow. Well you might raise an eyebrow.

           She smiles suggestively. But Christian is staring at the 
           blueprints with a newfound interest.

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE (CONT’D)
                        So, anything else I can do you for, Agent 
                        Wulff?

           She leans forward, revealing a bit more cleavage. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        You’ve been so generous, I’d hate to-

                                 PLATINUM BLONDE
                        Take advantage? I’m a big girl.
                                 CHRISTIAN
                        In that case, how about you show me that 
                        list?

           RING-RING. RING-RING.

           INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS, AGENT CONRAD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Conrad reaches out from behind a file labeled “Communist 
           Sympathizers” and picks up the phone.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Conrad here.

                        Records? What records?

                        You did.

           INT. CAMPUS ADMINISTRATION BUILDING, ID OFFICE - DAY

           Tess scrutinizes the JUNIOR G-MAN’S LIL’ ASSISTANT’S 
           BADGE in Dooley’s hand.

                                 TESS
                        Aren’t you a little young for the FBI?

                                 DOOLEY
                        I’m older than I look.

                                 TESS
                        Let me guess... Alpha Tau? Sig-Ep?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Excuse me?
                                 TESS
                        Last semester the pledges got hold of a 
                        gymnasium ID and dumped a truck-load of 
                        fizzies into the swim-meet. It’s not that 
                        I can’t appreciate a good prank. But if 
                        I’m gonna lose my job over one, I’d 
                        prefer it were something more original.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Look, Missus-

                                 TESS
                        Try Miss.

                                 DOOLEY
                        My investigation requires background 
                        checks on everyone on this campus. 

                                 TESS
                        That’s a lotta backgrounds.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Starting with all employees with 
                        clearance IDs-

                                 TESS
                        Like this one?

           She flashes her Blue Lion ID clipped to her sleeve, then 
           drops it behind the counter before he can respond.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        It’s funny... I had to get a new one just 
                        two days ago when my old one disappeared.

                                 DOOLEY
                        You lost it?

                                 TESS
                        Or somebody pinched it.

           Dooley seductively leans over the counter.

                                 DOOLEY
                        You wanna tell me about it?

           Tess seductively leans in to meet him.

                                 TESS
                        You got a warrant? 

                                 DOOLEY
                        I can get one.
                                 TESS
                        Then get one. Until then you’re not 
                        getting a thing outta me... Agent Conrad.

           EXT. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - EVENING

           The Secretaries file out in groups. Tess exits the 
           building by herself and heads home. A Figure watching 
           from the shadows follows her.

           EXT. WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

           Tess heads down a shadowy sidewalk and turns a corner. 
           The Figure, a half block behind, follows...

           AROUND THE CORNER...

           Tess is nowhere in sight.

           DING-A-LING! Tess emerges from a corner store with a sack 
           of detergent.

                                 TESS
                        Good night, Mister Nayfeld.

                                 SHOP OWNER (O.C.)
                        See ya tomorrow, Tess. 

           Tess continues down the sidewalk. Her stalker, apparently 
           gone.

           INT. TESS’ APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

           Tess checks her mailbox in the foyer. SNAP! Someone 
           outside? Too dark to see. She heads up the stairs to...

           SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY...

           Tess crosses the hall to her apartment - CREAK - No one 
           there. She opens the door, and locks it behind her. 

           Someone emerges from of the stairway and approaches her 
           door, when... the door before hers flies open. 

           Dooley jumps as an OLD MAN with thick white hair pops out.

                                 OLDER MAN
                                 (Slavic accent)
                        What do you want?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Nothing. I’m just looking for a friend.
                                 OLDER MAN
                        We have no vacancies, if that’s what you-

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        It’s all right, Mr. Polski.

           Dooley turns to see Tess standing in her doorway.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        He’s here for me.
                                 (to Dooley)
                        Coming in?

           Dooley smiles and enters her apartment. Mr. Polski glares 
           disapprovingly. She glares right back and shuts her door.

           INT. TESS’ APARTMENT - SAME

           Dooley scans the apartment. A pot boils behind the 
           kitchen divide. A table covered with... poems. She writes 
           poetry?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Something smells delicious.

                                 TESS
                        You must really be hungry. 

           She steps over to the pot and removes the lid.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        My landlord’s wash. University doesn’t 
                        pay much, so I do things for him on the 
                        side. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        So he’s your guardian angel.

                                 TESS
                        Yeah. He’s a regular saint.

           Her sarcasm is obvious.

                                 DOOLEY
                        I’m sorry, I-

                                 TESS
                        Listen, your persistence is impressive, 
                        but the IDs I have access to couldn’t get 
                        you bleacher seats at the football games, 
                        much less-

                                 DOOLEY
                        I didn’t come here about the IDs.
                                 TESS
                        What did you come here for?

                                 DOOLEY
                        To explain myself. Apologize. Whatever it 
                        takes to get you to have dinner with me.

                                 TESS
                        Okay... 

           Dooley smiles.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        ...explain yourself.

                                 DOOLEY
                        My name’s not Conrad, it’s Dooley. Thomas 
                        Dooley. And I’m not with the FBI. I’m an 
                        Agent for the OSS.

                                 TESS
                        Never heard of ‘em.

                                 DOOLEY
                        I’m starting to think that’s the idea. 
                        So, about dinner-

           Dooley stares at her trying to decipher her words, 
           when... KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK. 

                                 TESS
                        Excuse me.

           Tess goes to the door and opens it...

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        There’s my little man.

           ...revealing a young Italian woman with a baby. Tess 
           takes the baby and kisses him.

                                 BABY-SITTER
                        Tomorrow I go downtown, so you leave him 
                        with Mama, si?

                                 TESS
                        Of course. Grazie, Mia.

                                 BABY-SITTER
                        Prego, prego. Ciao, bambino.

                                 TESS
                        Say bye-bye, Charlie. Say bye-bye.
           Tess turns to face the speechless Dooley.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Door’s still open if you wanna make a 
                        break for it.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Why would I do that?

                                 TESS
                        Most boys do, once they realize I don’t 
                        come alone.

                                 DOOLEY
                        There’s your problem. Dating boys instead 
                        of men.

           Tess stares at him, trying to see past the line.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Your uh... laundry’s burning.

           She turns to see flames through the kitchen divide.

                                 TESS
                        Oh shhhh-oot.

           She lowers her baby, Charlie, to the love seat and races 
           for the overflowing pot. Charlie begins to CRY. Tess 
           removes the lid with a CLANG. Charlie’s CRYING halts. 
           Alarmed, Tess hurries around the divide to see... 

           ...Dooley bouncing Charlie in his arms. Charlie staring 
           back at him with wonder.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Those IDs you’re looking for? They’re 
                        classified. Locked in a room where even I 
                        can’t get to ‘em. 

           Tess takes her baby from his arms.

                                 DOOLEY
                        I told you, that’s not why I-

                                 TESS
                        But if it were say, a matter of national 
                        security? One could hide inside the 
                        building, wait for the guards to lock up, 
                        then sneak his way into the office. 

           Tess crosses to the door and opens it. Time for him to 
           leave. Defeated, Dooley walks out the door.
                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Saturday nights are best. But you’ll want 
                        to do it Friday.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Why Friday?

                                 TESS
                        Because Saturday you’re taking me to 
                        dinner.

           She closes the door. Dooley smiles.

           INT. ID OFFICE - DAY

           A delivery boy carries a vase of flowers down the row of 
           secretaries, and places it on Tess’ desk. The other girls 
           WHISPER as Tess reads the card with a smile.

           INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING, FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

           A Security Guard holds the door for the last of the 
           Secretaries, locks it behind them, and begins his rounds. 
           As his FOOTSTEPS fade down the hall, Dooley emerges from 
           a door marked: “REST ROOM” and heads up the stairs to...

           THE ID OFFICE...

           Dooley reaches the door and stops. No keyhole. Just an 
           odd metal slot. In his hand are three bobby-pins, a slim-
           jim, and a tennis ball with a hole in it. He tries the 
           bobby-pins first. What kind of lock is this?

           CLOMP-CLOMP-CLOMP... It’s the guard! Dooley looks around, 
           spots a dumbwaiter and climbs through the shaft- failing 
           to notice the sign marked: “GARBAGE CHUTE”.

           INT. HALLWAY, FIRST FLOOR - LATER

           Soiled in garbage, Dooley emerges from a numbered door 
           marked: “BASEMENT”. He steps out into the hallway when...

                                 FEMALE UNDERGRAD
                        Thanks for your help, Professor. I really 
                        want an “A” in your class. I guess I 
                        should be getting back to my dorm room.

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Maybe we should discuss it a little 
                        further. In the privacy of my office.

           He takes hold of her wrist. She looks at him 
           uncomfortably.
                                 FEMALE UNDERGRAD
                        Oh, I’m supposed to be meeting a friend.

           He moves in closer.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED PROFESSOR
                        Your friend can wait. You want an “A”, or 
                        not?

           THUMP - The Professor turns to a SOUND down the hall. 

           The Female Undergrad scurries away.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED PROFESSOR 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Damn.

           The Middle-Aged Professor heads towards the SOUND when - 
           SQUISH - he looks down at a puddle of slime by the 
           basement door. Slimy footprints continue...

           AROUND THE CORNER... 

           ...and down the next hall to -- an empty pair of shoes. 
           The Middle-Aged Professor rubs his beard.

           Behind him, Dooley drops from a ceiling pipe, tiptoes up 
           to him and - aiming for the sciatic nerve - strikes the 
           Middle-Aged Professor right below the kidney.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED PROFESSOR 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Owww!! What the-

           The Middle-Aged Professor spins to see...

           DOOLEY...

           Disappointed his trick didn’t work, he just kicks the 
           Middle-Aged Professor in the groin and knees him in the 
           head... just like Fleming showed him.

           ACROSS THE BUILDING...

           TH-THUMP. The Guard pauses hearing the sound.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Dooley drags the unconscious Professor to a bench then 
           spots the ID clipped to his sweater. Dooley takes the ID 
           and holds it up to the moonlight to see... 

           ...indentations along the laminated surface. Just like a 
           punch-card. Dooley smiles.
           THE GUARD...

           Follows the footprints to the unconscious Professor 
           splayed out on the bench. Yikes, he stinks! At least his 
           shoes do. Shoes too small to fit over his feet. 

           OUTSIDE ID OFFICE...

           Wearing the Professor’s oversized shoes, Dooley inserts 
           the ID into the Metal Slot - CA-CLUNK - and steps 
           inside...

           THE ID OFFICE...

           FLICK. Dooley turns on a workbench light to reveal... FGP 
           IDs in various colors, names, and indentation patterns.  

           CLOMP-CLOMP. Someone’s outside the door! Unsure which ID 
           to take, he grabs them all and bolts for a side door. 
           Locked. He shuffles through the IDs. CA-CLUNK. The Guard 
           enters the room. Empty, except someone left a light on. 

           SECOND ROOM...

           Dooley reaches the next door. It also has a metal slot. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        Oh for Pete’s-

           He searches the IDs again. CA-CLUNK - The Guard enters, 
           this time a moment before the other door can close shut. 
           The Guard pulls out his gun.

           INT. FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           CA-CLUNK. Dooley reaches the front hallway and heads for 
           the exit, when... Another Guard appears up ahead. Dooley 
           dives for the nearest door - CA-CLUNK - and enters a 
           numbered room marked: “Water Works”.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Down a staircase, to a room of large water pipes. The 
           sound of RUSHING WATER is deafening. Dooley looks around. 
           There are no other doors. 

           CA-CLUNK. Dooley turns to see the Guard’s feet, then 
           legs, then gun descending the stairs. Dooley looks around 
           in a panic. He spots something in the corner. 

           The Guard spins at the bottom of the stairs. No one 
           there. He steps into the room. Turns around. Nothing. He 
           heads back up the stairs past...
           ...a water main under the stairs with a key-card slot.

           INT. SEWER SYSTEM - NIGHT

           Dooley WHOOSHES out the mouth of the pipe and - SPLASH - 
           into the central sewer system. He stands in the knee deep 
           water, taking in his new surroundings.

                                 TESS (PRELAP)
                        Was I in love?

           INT. NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Tess smiles thoughtfully over the half empty wine bottle.

                                 TESS
                        As much as a sixteen year-old girl from 
                        Hammond, Indiana could know about love. 
                        Albert was charming and kind and full of 
                        big ideas. So when he asked me to run 
                        away with him to New York, I said yes. A 
                        month after we got here the war began. 
                        Albert got drafted, shipped to Manila, 
                        then three months later he was dead. I 
                        was five months along when I got the 
                        wire. No money, no job- My family? They’d 
                        made it clear when I left I wouldn’t be 
                        welcomed back. Funny how they never paid 
                        me much notice until I was gone.

           Tess touches Charlie sleeping beside her. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Truth is Albert and I were never married. 
                        So the Veteran's office never felt an 
                        obligation. I had to show up every day 
                        for a month just to get a job issuing IDs 
                        to a bunch of self-important university 
                        types while the neighbors raise my child.

           A moment of awkward silence.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Boy, I’m just dropping one bomb after 
                        another, aren’t I?

           Christian refills their glasses.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Honestly? I’m surprised you haven’t 
                        turned your back on the whole lot.

                                 TESS
                        What do you mean?
                                 CHRISTIAN
                        You sacrifice everything for a Government 
                        that gives you nothing in return? 

                                 TESS
                        What other choice do I have?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        You’re right. At the very least you can 
                        be proud your Albert died a hero. 

                                 TESS
                        Yeah. They even gave me a medal, isn’t 
                        that something? I gave them my life, and 
                        they give me a medal.

           Expecting tears, Christian reaches for his handkerchief.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re thinking. You’re 
                        thinking maybe if this girl could show a 
                        little humility, played the patriotic 
                        widow like she’s expected, maybe her life 
                        wouldn’t be so bad. But they made me beg 
                        for their stupid Government Girl job, all 
                        because the War Department doesn’t 
                        consider Charlie legitimate. Do you know 
                        what that makes him? What that makes me?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        More than they bargained for.

                                 TESS
                        Goddamn right.

           Surprised and impressed by her fire, Christian slips the 
           handkerchief back into his pocket.

           EXT. CAMPUS BENCH - NIGHT

           A Frat-Boy necks with a Sorority-Girl on a bench when - 
           KA-LANK - a soaking wet Dooley climbs out of a manhole. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        Dropped my keys. 

           Dooley strolls away with as much cool as possible.

           INT. DOOLEY’S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Dooley drags his soggy, smelly self inside and SIGHS. 
           WHACK! A fist sends him pirouetting to the floor.

                                                        ...FADE TO BLACK
           INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM - DAY

           SPLASH! Dooley is jolted awake in a chair. Agent McCord 
           lowers the bucket of ice-water. Armstrong leafs through 
           Dooley’s sketch-book. Conrad examines the stack of stolen 
           FGP IDs.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Listen. There’s another Agent. And I can 
                        prove it.

           SLAP! Conrad interrupts him with a single sheet of paper.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Know what that is?

                                 DOOLEY
                        It’s an Ultra.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Intercepted two days ago.

           Dooley decrypts the message in his head. Two words... 

                                 DOOLEY
                        “Roosevelt - 0100”. What is it?

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        His target.

           Following Conrad’s gazes out the window to...

           A SWEEPING AERIAL OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY’S QUAD... 

           Where students drape banners of red, white and blue over 
           rows and rows of chairs facing...

           ...a stage platform being built right over the 50 yard 
           line’s Blue Lion logo. 

           Over the stage is a poster of FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT’s 
           benevolent smile and the words: “RE-ELECT THE PRESIDENT”.

           INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM - DAY

                                 DOOLEY
                        Ambush ridge.

           Conrad, Armstrong and McCord turn from their chalkboard 
           diagram of the Quad to Dooley drawing in his sketch-book.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Come again?
           Dooley stands and takes the chalk from Conrad’s hand.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Lone Ranger, episode four, “Ambush 
                        Ridge”. Lee Powell’s trapped at the 
                        bottom of a canyon. With the Apache 
                        firing down from the cliff-tops, the 
                        Ranger’s a sitting duck. It’s the same 
                        principle here. The Quad’s just a canyon 
                        made of brick and mortar.

           Conrad takes back the chalk.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Right. Which is why we’ll need to 
                        establish a perimeter-

                                 DOOLEY
                        Only that’s not how he’ll do it. 

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Why not?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Because, he’s not a shooter. 

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        You think he’s gonna bomb-

                                 DOOLEY
                        He’s not a bomber either. Bombs are 
                        sloppy... indiscriminate. Our man’s too 
                        meticulous for that.

                                 AGENT ARMSTRONG
                        Then what-

                                 DOOLEY
                        I don’t know what- But not this. This 
                        is... simple. There’s a bigger picture.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Bigger picture? Roosevelt. Oh-one-hundred 
                        hours. That not big enough for you?

           Dooley’s just not convinced.

           INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS, NEW YORK - DAY 

           Steel cabinets are unlocked, files are pulled. Files 
           labeled: German American Bund. Names are copied from the 
           files, and onto a List.

           The List is mimeographed and handed out to FBI Agents.
           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           Agents barge in on a physics lecture. Ignoring the 
           Professor, they approach three male students and “escort” 
           them to the exit. 

           The Professor’s outrage is cut short when an Agent taps 
           him on the shoulder, and “escorts” him out as well. 

           INT. EMBASSY OF ARGENTINA - DAY

           SMASH!! FBI Agents storm the Argentinian embassy 
           arresting the Ambassador and his startled Bureaucrats. 

           INT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Terrified Students, confounded Professors, and outraged 
           Foreign Diplomats take their turn in the hot-seat, as 
           Conrad and the Burly Agent interrogate them.

           Names are crossed off The List. New names are added.

           EXT. DOCKS - DAY

           Men from foreign ships are rounded up along the docks.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Dooley enters the restaurant. Looks around for Tess. 
           Doesn’t see her. Checks his watch and looks again. 
           Sitting by the bar, looking right at him is... 

           TESS TRANSFORMED...

           Her hair styled, her face done up, and her dress - no one 
           could mistake this woman for a girl in this dress.

           Dooley approaches her.

                                 TESS
                        You look like you you’ve never seen me 
                        before?

                                 DOOLEY
                        You just look so... different.

                                 TESS
                        I need to tell you something. I’ve-

                                 DOOLEY
                        Oh! I got you something. It’s nothing 
                        big...
           Dooley reaches into his pocket and hands her a book. 
           Leaves of Grass, by Walt Whitman.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        ...I just saw it and thought of you. I 
                        know you like poetry, so.

           She stares at the book genuinely touched. 

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Do you already have it?

                                 TESS
                        No, it’s just... it’s lovely. Thank you.

                                 DOOLEY
                        So what did you need to tell me?

                                 TESS
                        Nothing. Let’s eat.

           INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS, NEW YORK - DAY

           Dooley holds up an FGP ID.

                                 DOOLEY
                        You know what this is? 

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        A security ID?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Out of a Jules Verne novel. These 
                        indentations along the surface? It’s 
                        code. Binary code. Like holes in a punch-
                        card, only microscopic. These aren’t just 
                        IDs, they’re mechanized key-cards.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        You know what I think? I think you think 
                        too much. You don’t need to know how a 
                        clock ticks to make it stop. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        Sure, just smash it with a hammer.

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        Works for me.

                                 DOOLEY
                        History is littered with tragedies that 
                        could’ve been avoided if someone had just 
                        followed up on all the leads. I’ve an 
                        asset I’ve been working. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOOLEY (CONT'D)
                        Someone on the inside. The President’s 
                        speech is in 24 hours. All I’m asking if 
                        for one to hear what she has to say. If 
                        it’s nothing, I’ll go back to DC... 
                        willingly.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Who’s the asset?

           INT. TESS’S HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Tess crosses the hall to her apartment, carrying Charlie 
           in her arms, when Mr. Polski bursts from his door. 

                                 MR. POLSKI
                        You find this amusing?

                                 TESS
                        Not now, please.

                                 MR. POLSKI
                        You leave the child with the Dagos all 
                        night so you can throw yourself at his 
                        feet like a little dog? Like this is some 
                        game?

                                 TESS
                        If it’s a game, I’m just playing it the 
                        best I can.

           He thrusts his arm against the door-frame halting her 
           with a start.

                                 MR. POLSKI
                        Just be sure you’re not the one who’s 
                        losing. I wonder, maybe your having the 
                        child was a mistake. Maybe it would be 
                        best if he were taken away. Say social 
                        services-

           Her eyes flash with maternal rage.

                                 TESS
                        You leave Charlie out of this.

                                 MR. POLSKI
                        Don’t confuse fantasy with reality, 
                        Douchka. You can’t afford it.

           He lowers his arm. She opens the door and steps inside to 
           find...

           TESS’ APARTMENT...
           ...Dooley and Conrad waiting for her.

                                 MR. POLSKI (CONT’D)
                        These men are from Washington. They have 
                        questions for you, about your job.

           Dooley smiles. Tess is totally caught off guard.

                                 MR. POLSKI (CONT’D)
                        I’ll just leave you alone then.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Sorry if we startled you. Your landlord 
                        insisted we wait inside. So this is 
                        Special Agent Conrad of the FBI. The real 
                        Agent Conrad. Show her your badge.

           Conrad ignores him.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Agent Conrad, this is Tess-

           Tess regains her composure and turns to face them.

                                 TESS
                        Pleasure to meet you, Agent Conrad. Can I 
                        offer you some tea? Agent Dooley?

           Dooley is taken aback by her formality.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Tea sounds fine. 

           Tess lays Charlie in his crib and steps around the 
           kitchen divide.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        Agent Dooley tells me you work at 
                        Columbia.

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        That’s right.

                                 AGENT CONRAD 
                        In the ID Office. Interesting work?

                                 TESS
                        It’s data administration.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        What kind of data?

                                 TESS
                        The kind I wouldn’t understand.
           She steps around the divide, sets down her tea set and 
           gathers up her papers.

                                 DOOLEY
                        They’re lovely by the way.

           Tess looks up. Dooley points to the pages in her hand.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Your poems. Have you had a chance to read-

           SLAM. An uncomfortable silence as Tess shuts her poems up 
           in a drawer. Dooley feels the cold from across the room.

                                 TESS
                        Why don’t we make this easy, Gentlemen. 
                        You tell me what it is you’re looking 
                        for, and I tell you whether or not I can 
                        help.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        All right. Let’s start with these.

           Conrad tosses the FGP IDs onto the table. Tess stares at 
           the IDs in shock.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        Tell us what you know.

                                 TESS
                        I can’t.

                                 DOOLEY
                        It’s okay. Any information you give is 
                        just to corroborate what we already-

                                 TESS
                        I can’t help you, because I don’t know 
                        what these are.

           Dooley looks at her surprised.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        But you work in the ID office.

                                 TESS
                        As a receptionist.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        And yet you told Agent Dooley-

                                 TESS
                        Agent Dooley obviously misunderstood.
           Dooley confused expression changes when he spots 
           something. A saucer filled with cigarette butts by the 
           window sill. A pack of Chesterfields beside it.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Honestly, I’m just a low level employee 
                        who doesn’t ask questions and does what 
                        she’s told. 

           Conrad stares at her.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry if I made you think-

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Know what I think? I think you’re smarter 
                        than you look. Single young mother with a 
                        bastard kid meets a single young fella 
                        naive enough not to care. 

           Tess turns to Dooley. But his back is turned, standing by 
           the window.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        So why not let him think you know more 
                        than you do if it keeps him interested. 

           Tess looks back at Conrad, wipes a tear from her cheek.

                                 TESS
                        Sure. A girl’s gotta think of her future, 
                        right?

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Right.

           Charlie begins to CRY. Tess goes to his crib and picks 
           him up. 

                                 TESS
                        If there’s nothing else, gentlemen...

           Conrad heads for the door.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Agent Dooley?

           Dooley approaches Tess. She refuses to look at him.

                                 DOOLEY
                        I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve that.

           Dooley offers her a cigarette from the pack of 
           Chesterfields. 
           She hesitates, looks at the ashtray by the window. Then 
           looks at Dooley.

                                 TESS
                        No. Thank you.

           Dooley stares at her as she holds her baby tight.

           Conrad CLEARS HIS THROAT and opens the door. Dooley 
           follows him out to...

           THE APARTMENT HALLWAY...

           Tess is about to shut the door behind them when Dooley 
           turns.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Your cigarettes.

           Leaning in close, he whispers in her ear.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        He’s not who you think he is.

           Her expression changes. 

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Good night, Tess.

           EXT. TESS’ BUILDING, SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           Dooley and Conrad reach the sidewalk.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Well, that was an hour wasted.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Did you see the cigarette butts? Not one 
                        of them was marked with lipstick.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Proving what? That she doesn’t smoke? Or 
                        you’re not the only asset she’s working?

           Dooley slows until Conrad is out of earshot.

                                 DOOLEY
                                 (to self)
                        Or that she’s in love with him.

           Dooley looks up to see Conrad, Armstrong and McCord 
           standing by the open door of the black sedan. 
                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Your lead was a bust. Time for you to go 
                        home... willingly.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Okay, hear me out.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           CA-THUMP! Dooley is thrown into the trunk of the black 
           sedan. SLAM!

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        To DC?

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        LaGuardia. Stick him on the next flight 
                        out. I don’t wanna see his stupid mug 
                        again until this whole thing is over.

           McCord PEELS out.

           From a 2nd floor window across the street, Christian 
           watches the entire scene through spy binoculars. 

           INT. DOOLEY’S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           A pair of skilled hands in black gloves picks the lock on 
           Dooley’s motel room. 

           Closet... Empty. Night stand... Bible. Under the 
           mattress... Bingo. Dooley’s sketch-book. 

           Flipping through pages... No IDs. Just comic-book style 
           drawings of past, present, and possible future events...

           ...the Ragged Men blowing the street up with a bottle of 
           nitro ...a stiletto switchblade severing a spinal cord 
           ...a Gunman peering out a window overlooking the Quad...

           The gloved hand turns the page to...

           ...a portrait of Tess, holding her baby in her arms. Her 
           eyes closed, her head touching his, with a melancholy 
           smile on her face... 

           Below the portrait are the words: “La Pietà”

           The gloved hand takes the page and - RIIIIP!! 

           INT. CHRISTIAN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Christian watches the tea activate the Invisible Ink on 
           the Third and Final Message. Message 3: A phone number.

           EXT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT - DAY

           A PILOT leads McCord and a handcuffed Dooley across the 
           tarmac.

                                 PILOT
                        I can give him a ride. So long as he 
                        doesn’t mind riding cargo.

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        So long as you’re headed for DC.
                                 PILOT
                        Actually we’re escorting a K-74 airship 
                        to the Canadian border. But we can 
                        leapfrog it over to DC.

           Dooley halts, not at the sight of the CURTISS C-46 
           military plane, but the giant K-74 HYDROGEN AIRSHIP 
           hovering over the tarmac behind it.

           PPRRPPP-RRPP-RRPRPP!! The propeller engines ROAR alive as 
           McCord removes Dooley’s handcuffs.

                                 PILOT (CONT’D)
                        He dangerous?

                                 AGENT MCCORD 
                        As a kitten.

           Dooley stares nervously at the rickety transport plane.

                                 AGENT MCCORD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look so worried. They say Navy 
                        pilots are the best. Have a nice flight.

           Dooley enters the plane as the Pilot closes the hatch.

           INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

           Dooley straps in and peers out the window to see...

           ...the airship, bearing the words: “US NAVY”, rising into 
           the air. Its .50 caliber turret guns do a test-spin.

           EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

           Both airship and airplane ascend into the thick clouds.

           INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

           RUMBLE-RUMBLE-RUMBLE... Powerful turbulence shakes the 
           fuselage. Dooley shuts his eyes as the temperature drops.

           EXT. ABOVE THE FOG - DAY

           The airship and cargo plane rise out of the clouds, 
           leaving the weather and the turbulence below. 

           INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

           Dooley turns from the window with a SIGH, when...

                                 NAVAL OFFICER
                        Not a fan of flying, huh?
           A NAVAL OFFICER sits across from him. When did he get on?

                                 NAVAL OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        These boys are Navy pilots. They’re-

           RUMBLE-RUMBLE-RUMBLE...

                                 DOOLEY
                        ...the best?

           The Naval Officer smiles, unbuttons his uniform - passing 
           over his handgun - and pulls out a pack of lucky strikes.

           INT. COCKPIT - SAME

           The Pilot eyes the airship through the starboard window.

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Hope the weather’s better in DC. I’d hate 
                        to fly through that again. 

                                 PILOT 
                        You won’t have to.

           The Pilot raises a silencer pistol - PIEEWWW-PIEEWW - 
           firing two shots into the Co-Pilot’s torso.

           INT. CARGO HOLD - SAME

           FLICK. The Naval Officer lights his cigarette.

                                 NAVAL OFFICER
                        Smoke?

           Dooley looks at him. Shakes his head.

                                 NAVAL OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Never know. Could be your last.

           Dooley looks at him again. Why is he smiling so much? And 
           why is Dooley shivering while this guy... is that a bead 
           of sweat dripping down his temple?

           Dooley spots the bulge of the gun in his shirt. The Naval 
           Officer reaches for it. 

           Dooley punches the release on his body-belt and leaps out 
           of his seat. 

           KRACK-KRACK-KRACK! Bullets pierce the fuselage walls, 
           following Dooley as he dives behind a cargo crate. 

           The Naval Officer hits the release on his own body-belt 
           and stands. 
           Dooley glances around for a weapon... He spots something.

                                 NAVAL OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Agent Dooley. Let’s not make 
                        this messier than it needs to be. 

           The Officer leaps around the crate-- Dooley’s gone.

           Dooley emerges from a different crate by the hatch door. 
           An aluminum pipe in his hand. Dooley moves in, raises the 
           pipe...

           ...unknowingly hooking his sleeve over the pulley of a 
           parachute zip-line...

           ...and swings the pipe at the Officer’s head.

           RIIIIP!!

           The Officer spins around to see... Dooley with his arm 
           hooked over his head to the parachute railing. 

           The Officer watches as Dooley struggles to pull himself 
           free. It’s no use. He’s securely hooked. 

           The Officer takes careful aim at Dooley’s head.

           Dooley spots the handle on the hatch door and kicks it.

           The door rips open as wind blasts through the plane. 
           KRACK-PING! The shot just misses, as the Officer 
           stumbles.

           INT. COCKPIT - SAME

           Hearing the SHOT, the Pilot reaches for the radio and 
           taps out a message in Morse code. 

           INT. CARGO HOLD - SAME

           With his arm anchored to the ceiling, Dooley kicks his 
           legs up off the floor and around the Officer’s neck. 

                                 NAVAL OFFICER 
                        GUUUURRRKKK!

           Dooley spins his body like a crank shaft, flipping the 
           Officer off his feet - THWACK - against a crate - CRASH -  
           and out the open hatch.

           The Officer grabs Dooley’s legs, pulling Dooley half-way 
           out the airplane hatch. 
           Dooley kicks as the Officer claws his way up Dooley’s 
           leg.

           RIIII-II-II!! The sleeve of his jacket begins to tear.

           As the Officer grabs Dooley’s belt - FLWOOP - it comes 
           off in his hand. He looks up to see Dooley - SNAP -
           undoing the button on his pants...

                                 NAVAL OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        No. No-no-no-no-no...

           ...and - ZIIP - drops his zipper. 

                                 NAVAL OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        NAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

           The Officer tumbles out the plane clutching Dooley’s 
           pants.

           RIP! Dooley’s sleeve tears off - THUMP - dropping him to 
           the floor in his Army issued boxers.

           INT. COCKPIT - MOMENTS LATER

           The cockpit door opens. 

                                 PILOT
                                 (German w/subtitles)
                        You certainly took your sweet time.

           Dooley presses the gun against the Pilot’s head.

                                 DOOLEY
                        I got hung up.

           Dooley takes the Pilot’s pistol. The Pilot slides a hand 
           down his leg towards a dagger strapped to his ankle.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Wer sind Sie? SS? Abwehr? Wer sind Sie!

                                 PILOT
                        I’m American, just like you. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        You’re with the Network, aren’t you. The 
                        Network has sleeper agents in the Militar-

           The Pilot swings his dagger at Dooley’s throat when... 

           BAM! The Pilot SCREAMS as a bullet rips through his hand. 
           Dooley spins to see the Co-Pilot, wounded but alive. 
                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Good shot.

                                 CO-PILOT
                        I was aiming for his face.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Wait! I need him alive. 

           Hunched over the radio, the Pilot TAPS another message.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        If I can get to the people who sent him, 
                        I can get to the Thirteenth-

           BA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA!!

           .50 Caliber rounds tear through the cockpit, the radio, 
           and the Pilot, as the airship opens fire on the plane.

           Dooley hits the floor. 

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Why are they shooting at us?

                                 DOOLEY
                        He radioed them in Morse. They must think 
                        we’re the saboteurs.

           BA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA!! Dooley lunges for the controls.

           EXT. SKY - SAME

           The plane banks into a nose dive.

           BA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA...!! The airship guns swivel after the 
           plane as it disappears into the clouds below.

           INT. COCKPIT - DAY

           Dooley yanks the Pilot to the floor and takes his seat.

                                 CO-PILOT
                        You know how to fly a plane?

                                 DOOLEY
                        I know how planes fly. Can’t be that 
                        hard. Wheel controls the pitch. Pedals 
                        control the rudder. Okay. I think I got-

           RUMBLE-RUMBLE-RUMBLE... Dooley is thrown from his seat.
                                 CO-PILOT
                        We’re not gonna last long with this 
                        turbulence. Get us out of these clouds so 
                        we can figure out where we are.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Okay... How?

                                 CO-PILOT
                        City lights. Like the ones you’d see on a-

                                 DOOLEY
                        Skyscraper!!

           The clouds suddenly vanish, revealing a building dead 
           ahead! Dooley banks hard left.

           EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY

           SKREEEE - The tip of the wing scrapes along the surface 
           of the high-rise - SMASH-SMASH-SMASH - taking out half 
           the windows along the 15th floor, before the plane steers 
           clear. 

           INT. COCKPIT - SAME

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Where the hell are we?

                                 DOOLEY
                        I think we just skimmed the Helmsley 
                        Building.

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Where’s that?

                        Around 46th and Park.
           EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY

           VRRRRROOOOOMMMM!! Pedestrians look up as the C-46 ZOOMS 
           overhead through the canyon-like streets.

           INT. COCKPIT - SAME

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Whatever you do, don’t climb.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Don’t climb?! We’re in the middle of 
                        downtown Manhattan!

           The bloodied Pilot, lying on the floor, stirs awake.

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Takes a thousand feet to climb. Three 
                        hundred to turn. Just keep calm until we 
                        have enough clearing.

                                 DOOLEY
                        You wouldn’t happen to have a map of New 
                        York on you.

           The Pilot kicks the gun from the Co-Pilot’s good hand and 
           swings his blade at Dooley. Dooley releases the controls 
           and catches the Pilot’s hand.

           The plane wobbles.

           The Co-Pilot releases his body belt, throws himself over 
           the Pilot, and tears him off of Dooley.

           Dooley turns back to the controls to see...

           Another building dead ahead. Dooley banks hard to the 
           left turning the plane sideways. The grappled Pilots are 
           thrown across the cockpit and - SMASH - into the glass.

           EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN - SAME

           PING-PING-PING-PING-PING- The plane takes out a row of 
           flagpoles before banking away.

           INT. COCKPIT - SAME

           But Dooley has over-banked the turn, and is heading too 
           close to the building across the street. Close enough to 
           see the shocked faces watching from the windows. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        Steady... steady.
           As Dooley eases the plane back towards the center of the 
           street... 

           ...the Pilot yanks his wrist from the Co-Pilot’s grasp, 
           whipping the blade across the cockpit.

           THUNK - Dooley jolts as the knife stabs into his seat, 
           inches from his ear.

           EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN - SAME

           The plane reacts to his jolt, whipping the left wing up 
           too quickly.

           SMASSSSSHHHH - Taking out a row of windows from the 12th 
           to the 18th floor.

           INT. OFFICE HIGH RISE - SAME

           People SCREAM as they run clear of the shattering glass.

           EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN - SAME

           The battered plane levels out. The Pilots drop to the 
           floor. The Pilot scrambles to retrieve his blade.

           Dooley pulls out his gun and aims.

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Look out!! 

           Both Dooley and the Pilot stop and look to see...

           THE CHRYSLER BUILDING...

           Dead ahead.

           INT. COCKPIT - SAME

           Dooley climbs and banks left, twisting away from the wall 
           of glass and steel. 

           EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN - SAME

           BANG!! The plane’s belly nicks a gargoyle shaped like a 
           hood ornament, puncturing the fuel tank. Fuel spews out.

           INT. COCKPIT - SAME

           The Pilots tumble as Dooley struggles to regain control. 
           His gun, laying on the instrument panel, slides towards 
           the broken window. Dooley reaches for it. Too late. 
                                 DOOLEY
                        Aww nuts.

           The Pilot yanks his blade from the chair. The Co-Pilot 
           grabs him from behind. The Pilot drops the blade as he 
           SLAMS the Co-Pilot up against the cockpit hatch. 

           THUNK! Two parachutes and a bright red EMERGENCY SURVIVAL 
           KIT fall from the hatch.  

           Dooley spots a clearing up ahead to the left.

                                 CO-PILOT
                        There’s a clearing, nine o’clock!

           The Co-Pilot struggles to hold the Pilot. Dooley goes for 
           it, steering the plane towards the clearing, when... 

           ...the Pilot breaks free and leaps onto Dooley. He fights 
           to keep control while grappling with the maniac Pilot.

           Dooley peers through the Pilot’s fingers towards the 
           clearing, which reveals itself to be...

           A SKYSCRAPER IN THE MIDST OF CONSTRUCTION...

           BASH!! The Co-Pilot knocks the Pilot off of Dooley with 
           the emergency survival kit... sending bandages, morphine, 
           and a flare gun across the cockpit.

           Too late to turn away, Dooley heads straight into the 
           tower of bare beams and girders. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        Hang on!!

           EXT. SKYSCRAPER CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME

           Construction workers turn as the C-46 ROARS past. Dooley 
           navigates over and under the beams, tipping the wings 
           from left to right. 

           Iconic image of workers sitting on a beam for lunch. One 
           worker at the end sets down his coffee, turns for his 
           lunch box - VRRROOOMMM - turns back... his coffee’s gone.

           Up ahead, a beam hanging from a crane swings out from 
           nowhere. Dooley sees the whites of the Worker’s eyes...

           ...Dooley yanks the wheel doing a fully inverted spin 
           beneath the beam and completes the full 360 rising up and 
           out of the construction site.
                                 DOOLEY
                        Enough of this Coney Island crap.

           Dooley yanks the wheel in a full climb as they 
           approach...

           THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING...

           The plane shudders as it climbs upwards, the building 
           racing closer and closer, until... Both plane and 
           building disappear in the clouds. 

           The plane is almost vertical when - SKREEEEEE - its belly 
           scrapes the surface of the Empire State. 

           INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - SAME

           Office Workers are startled by the SOUND and sight of the 
           cargo plane zooming up past their windows.

           Dooley struggles to hold the shaking wheel.

           EXT. CLOUDS OVER MANHATTAN - SAME

           Nothing but silence. Until... VRRRROOOOMMMM!! The plane 
           ROARS out of the clouds finally clear of Lower 
           Manhattan’s skyscraper central. 

           INT. COCKPIT - SAME

                                 DOOLEY
                        We made it! We-

           CLICK. The Pilot, bloody and beaten, has recovered his 
           silencer pistol, aims it at Dooley and cocks the hammer.

           BANG! The Pilot jolts, looks down to see a smoking flare 
           gun in Dooley’s hand. He reaches down feeling the flare 
           protruding from his torso. But nothing happens. 

           The Pilot raises the gun again when... SSSSSSSSSSSTH!!

           The flare spews red sparks from the Pilots mid-section 
           and rockets him through the cockpit door and down the 
           cargo hold.

           BOOOOOM!! A flash of RED signals the end of the Pilot.

           Dooley and the Co-Pilot share a smile of victory, when..

           PUT-PUT-PUTTT-PUUUTTT-PUUTTTHHHHHH...
           They look out the cockpit windows as both propeller 
           engines die. They look down at the fuel gauge... “EMPTY”.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        What do we do?

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Land.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Where?!

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Anywhere!

           Dooley scans the city and spots...

           CENTRAL PARK...

           As the altitude gauge drops, Dooley veers the plane over 
           the trees - SCRIIIIPPP - tearing out the landing gear.

           Fighting the controls, Dooley glides the plane over the 
           lake - SPPPPLLLLAAASSSSHHHHH - touching the belly down 
           where the water ends - BAAMM - and the great lawn begins.

           The ground rips open as the plane skids across the great 
           lawn. The propellers bending back in a hail of sparks. 

           INT. COCKPIT - SAME

           Through the windshield Dooley sees a patch of boulders up 
           ahead. He throws his weight on the controls...

           EXT. PLANE - SAME

           ...tipping the wing and driving it into the ground - 
           CRASH - throwing it into a tail-spin.

           The plane spins across the lawn as the wings, tail and 
           fuselage break apart. The cockpit slides to a halt.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK, GREAT LAWN - DAY

           Dooley climbs out of the cockpit with the wounded Co-
           Pilot. Clear of the wreckage, the two fall to the grass.

           WHIRRRRRRRRRRR-RRR-RRR-RRR...!!

           Dooley and the Co-Pilot look up to see...

           THE NAVY AIRSHIP...

           ...emerging from the fog, heading right for them. 
                                 CO-PILOT
                        Something tells me they know we’re not 
                        saboteurs.

           That’s when Dooley notices...

           Bolts of static blue electricity along the back of the 
           blimp. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        Saint Elmo’s fire.

           Dooley turns to the remaining emergency survival kit on 
           the ground, grabs the flare gun and loads another flare.

           As the airship bears down on them, the gun turrets swivel 
           in their direction. 

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Any last words?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Yeah.

           Dooley raises the flare gun and aims for the tail.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Remember the Hindenburg?

           BA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA...!! The airship opens fire as a path 
           of exploding dirt from the .50 caliber rounds head 
           straight for Dooley.

           BANG! SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHH... The red 
           flare swirls up in a great arc, all the way to the blue 
           static along the blimp’s tail, where it bursts with a... 

           ...POP!

           KAAA-KRAAAAAOOOOOWWWWWW!!

           The burst of flames literally consumes the skin of the 
           airship in seconds - leaving the gun turret intact.

           BA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA...!! The shots reaching closer to 
           Dooley, when...

           BA-BOOOOOOOOOOOOOMM!! The hydrogen containers explode, 
           and a sky full of burning metal crumbles to earth. The 
           gun turret is crushed beneath the inferno.

                        Don’t worry, Agent Dooley! Unlike the 
                        FBI, we know we’re on the same side! What 
                        can I do for you?!

                                 DOOLEY
                        You have to cancel the President’s speech 
                        tomorrow! There’s an operative! A German 
                        operative! Probably SS-

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Save your breath, Agent! We know all 
                        about it! The General briefed me last 
                        night!

                                 DOOLEY
                        Then you’ve changed the carriage route?! 
                        Switched the venue?!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Not at all!
                                 DOOLEY
                        Why the hell not?!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        President’s orders! Says it’ll be a cold 
                        day in hell when he has to hide from the 
                        enemy in his own damn country! But he did 
                        ask me to pass on a message for you!

           Prescott climbs into the back of a waiting secret service 
           sedan. Dooley leans in to hear the message.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        “Catch him!”

           Prescott slams the door on Dooley’s stupefied face.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - EVENING

           DING-A-LING! Tess exits the shop with her detergent.

                                 SHOP OWNER (O.S.)
                        See ya tomorrow, Tess.

           Tess heads down the sidewalk lost in thought. Suddenly 
           she’s fighting back tears. A rueful LAUGH escapes her 
           throat. Shaking it off, she wipes her tears as she...

           TURNS THE CORNER...

           And halts at the sight of... Two Hoover Blues “chatting” 
           with Mr. Polski on the steps of her building. 

           A HAND yanks her off the sidewalk and into...

           A SIDE ALLEY...

           Dooley covers her mouth, muffling her SCREAM. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        It’s okay, Tess. It’s me. It’s all right. 

                                 TESS
                        All right? All right? You brought the FBI 
                        to my home! How could it possibly be all 
                        right? 

                                 DOOLEY
                        It’s not you they want, and you know it.

                                 TESS
                        You know what I know? You can’t trust 
                        anybody in this world but yourself. 
                                 DOOLEY
                        You can trust me.

                                 TESS
                        Then why was I fired today?

                                 DOOLEY
                        What?

                                 TESS
                        Guess your FBI buddy didn’t care for my 
                        answers.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Listen to me. It’s not too late to fix 
                        this. Let me help you.

                                 TESS
                        How?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Tell me where he is.

                                 TESS
                        I don’t know who you’re talking about.

                                 DOOLEY
                        If you keep protecting him, I won’t be 
                        able to protect you. And I don't just 
                        mean from the FBI. 

           Tess just stares at him.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        What did he tell you? That he works for 
                        the Government? That he needs your help? 
                        That he loves you? It’s a lie. 

           She slaps him. That’s it. She’s just admitted everything. 
           And from the look in her eyes, she doesn’t care.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        He’s a liar. He’s lying to you, and he’s 
                        going to use you, and then he’s going to 
                        kill you!

           SLAP! SLAP-SLAP! Dooley holds her wrists. She fights him, 
           forcing him to hold her up against the wall. She looks up 
           at him, tears streaming. He’s yearning to save her. 

           Tess kisses him. His surprise fades beneath the rapture. 

           But the kiss doesn’t stop her tears. She wants to want 
           him, but she can’t force it and breaks their kiss.
           Dooley opens his eyes. She can’t look at him.

                                 TESS
                        Why do you even care?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Because you don’t deserve this. Because-

                                 TESS
                        You’re in love with me?

           Dooley is caught off guard. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        You don’t love me. You pity me.

                                 DOOLEY
                        That’s not true.

                                 TESS
                        You’re not going to let this go, are you? 
                        You’re going to make me do it.

                                 DOOLEY
                        It’s not too late to fix this. If you 
                        just trust me and tell me where he is.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

           A crowd stares up at a building news ticker headline: 
           “...RED SOX LEFT FIELDER TED WILLIAMS ENLISTS IN NAVY...”

           A bushy-haired intellectual cuts through the hypnotized 
           crowd, oblivious to the news ticking over his head.

           INT. GRAND HOTEL - DAY

           The intellectual crosses the lobby to the front desk. A 
           DESK CLERK greets him with a room key.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Afternoon, Professor Görg. Nothing in the 
                        mail for ya. ‘Course not much mail coming 
                        in from Germany these days, eh Professor?

           PROFESSOR GÖRG MUTTERS some INSULT in GERMAN as he takes 
           his key and heads for the elevators. Christian snuffs out 
           his Chesterfield, rises from his seat in the lobby and 
           follows the Professor into the elevator.

           SECONDS LATER...

           Agent Conrad enters the Hotel leading Agents Armstrong 
           and McCord through the lobby towards the same elevators.
                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        All right, we got Professors Szilard, 
                        Weisskopf and Dunning on the eighth and 
                        ninth floor. Goudsmit, Fermi and Görg on 
                        the fourth and fifth. You two take the 
                        first. I’ll take the second. 

           As Conrad hits the elevator call button...

           ...Dooley enters the hotel. Spotting Conrad, Dooley leaps 
           behind a lobby pillar. He looks around. Spots a stairwell 
           across the way.

           Conrad impatiently stares at the static elevator arrows.

           INT. PROFESSOR GÖRG’S HOTEL ROOM - SAME

           Christian examines an FGP ID. Rubs his thumb over the 
           name “Professor Rudolf Görg, Water Engineer” and pauses-

           He holds the ID beneath a lamp, angling it just so to 
           reveal... small indentations along the laminated surface.

           Christian smiles, pockets the ID and heads for the 
           door... stepping over the Professor’s dead body.

           INT. LOBBY FLOOR - SAME

           Conrad loses his patience.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        I’m taking the stairs.

           Conrad heads back into the lobby towards the stairwell.

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        The lift’s here.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        You take it.

           DING. An ELEVATOR OPERATOR slides open the lift gate.

                                 ELEVATOR OPERATOR
                        Front lobby, watch your step. 

           As hotel guests step out, Armstrong and McCord step in.

           As Conrad marches past, Dooley drops his newspaper and 
           leaps from a seat in the lobby (the same seat Christian 
           was in) and heads for the elevators.

           As Armstrong and McCord’s elevator goes up... DING! The 
           next one arrives.
           Dooley glances over his shoulder towards Conrad as he 
           waits for the guests to step out. 

           Conrad reaches the stairwell, glances back, and halts...

           As Dooley enters the elevator - OOOF - bumping into 
           Christian as he steps out.

                                 DOOLEY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Not at all.

           Dooley pauses. His eyes follow Christian down the lobby.

                                 ELEVATOR OPERATOR
                        Goin’ up.

           Dooley steps onto...

           THE ELEVATOR...

           The gate slides shut, and the lift begins to rise.

                                 ELEVATOR OPERATOR (CONT’D)
                        Floor?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Fourth, pl-

           Dooley’s heart skips a beat as he...

           FLASHBACKS TO...

           Swinging his gun into Christian’s face in the alleyway.

           BACK TO ELEVATOR... 

           Dooley lunges for the emergency stop - SCREEE - bringing 
           the lift to a SHUDDERING halt.

                                 ELEVATOR OPERATOR
                        What’s the big idea?!

                                 DOOLEY
                        Down! Take it down! Now!!

           EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE - DAY

           As Christian strolls out the revolving doors...
           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           ...Dooley yanks open the gate and bolts for the exit.

                                 ELEVATOR OPERATOR
                        Watch your step!

           EXT. SIDEWALK INTERSECTION - DAY

           Christian stands at the corner waiting for the light to 
           turn. Above him the news ticker reads: “...JAMES CAGNEY’S 
           YANKEE DOODLE DANDY #1 AT BOX OFFICE...“

           EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE - DAY

           Dooley bursts out the revolving doors, looks around. He 
           spots Christian at the corner through the crowd, when...

           ZIP! Conrad slaps a handcuff over one of his wrists.

                                 AGENT CONRAD 
                        Gotcha.

                                 DOOLEY
                        What? No! He’s there! He’s right there!

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        This time I’m locking you up myself.

           Dooley struggles as Conrad tries to cuff his other wrist.

                                 DOOLEY
                        He’s gonna get away! Right there at the 
                        corner! In the white hat!

           Conrad double-takes as Christian calmly steps off the 
           curb, despite the red light, and climbs into a cab.

           Dooley breaks from Conrad...

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Hey!

           ...and races for the cab, handcuff dangling from one 
           wrist.

           INT. TAXI - DAY 

           Christian tips his hat as he climbs over the startled 
           couple in the back of the cab. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        So sorry.
           EXT. SIDEWALK INTERSECTION - DAY 

           As the light changes the cab pulls away.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Stop that cab!

           Conrad leaps in front of the Taxi - SCREEEECH! - and 
           tumbles over the hood. Dooley throws open the door to 
           find... the startled couple and Christian’s white fedora 
           on the seat beside them. Dooley spins around, his eyes 
           scanning the streets...

           DOWN THE BLOCK...

           Christian ducks around a corner. Dooley hurries to Conrad 
           and helps him up. 

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Find a police box. Tell them suspect is 
                        headed eastbound on foot. Agent in 
                        pursuit.

           Dooley bolts after Christian.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Hey, wait! Goddammit! Stupid kid doesn’t 
                        even carry a-

           Conrad halts. Checks for his side-arm. Gone.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        Son of a-

           SKREEEEEECH!

           EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

           A car slams its breaks. Christian skillfully slides over 
           the hood and continues across the street. 

           Dooley races after him. SKREEEECH!! Dooley tumbles over 
           the hood of another car, landing hard on the pavement.

           SKREEEEE!! The wheel of a third car stops inches from 
           Dooley’s face. He opens his eyes in time to see...

           ...Christian descending a subway stairwell.

           INT. SUBWAY STAIRS - DAY

           Dooley bounds down the subway stairs and halts. “Uptown” 
           or “Downtown”? BROM-ROMM-ROMM-ROMM-ROMM!
           INT. UPTOWN PLATFORM - DAY

           Christian cuts through the crowd to the far end of the 
           platform just as a train pulls in. 

           Dooley reaches the platform as the last of the crowd 
           boards the train. He sees Christian in furthest car down.

           The doors are about to close. Dooley leaps for the 
           closest car. 

           INT. FRONT SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Christian steps to the doors along the track-side of the 
           train and pries them open. Passengers watch as he drops 
           out of the train, hops over the tracks and climbs onto 
           the opposite platform.  

           INT. BACK SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Dooley pushes through the crowd towards the front car 
           when...

           ...he spots Christian through the window heading for the 
           exit on the opposite platform. 

           As the train begins to move, Christian gives him a wink. 

           Dooley leaps for the track-side doors, forces them open 
           and leaps...

           SMACK - Dooley gets stuck in the track-side doors. He 
           struggles to free himself as the train picks up speed. Up 
           ahead, the entrance to the tunnel moves closer to 
           crushing his head.

           Dooley looks through the glass doors, stretching his 
           inside arm to reach... the emergency stop cord. 

           SCREEEEEEEEEEE!! 

           Passengers tumble as the train GRINDS to a halt. Dooley 
           shuts his eyes as the edge of the tunnel comes to rest 
           against his cheek and presses his hat against his face.

           Christian looks back as Dooley tumbles out the doors and 
           onto the tracks. Christian bolts for the exit. 

           EXT. SUBWAY EXIT, SIDEWALK - DAY

           Christian reaches street level and does a 180 against the 
           flow of the crowd. Dooley surfaces and runs with the flow 
           of the crowd.
           DOWN THE SIDEWALK...

           Christian walks briskly, eyes forward. 

           UP THE SIDEWALK...

           Dooley stops, hops up a lamp post and looks around. He 
           spots him.

           Christian maneuvers through the Crowd. As a group of 
           rowdy sailors emerge from a bar, Christian cuts behind 
           them. 

           Dooley pushes through the group of sailors.

                                 ROWDY SAILOR
                        Hey watch it, pal.

           No Christian. Dooley spins in all directions. There!

           THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW OF A CHINESE LAUNDRY...

           Christian ducks under the front counter and heads for the 
           back.

           INT. CHINESE LAUNDRY - DAY

           Christian ignores the Old Woman CURSING him in CANTONESE, 
           and walks out the back door to...

           A BACK ALLEY...

           Christian bolts down the alley and rounds a corner. 

           INT. CHINESE LAUNDRY - DAY

           Dooley struggles past the angry Old Woman to...

           THE BACK ALLEY...

           And bolts down the same corner. 

           EXT. LONG ALLEYWAY - DAY

           Halfway down the long alleyway, Christian spots a 
           construction ladder and scurries up. 

           EXT. LONG ALLEYWAY - DAY

           Dooley bolts down the long alleyway and passes the same 
           ladder. 

           Dooley reaches the end of the alley... it’s a dead end.
           Dooley looks around. Notices the building behind him is 
           under construction and spots the ladder.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

           Christian reaches the roof, runs to a door. Locked! He 
           runs to the edge of the building and peers down. It’s a 
           ten story drop to the alleyway below.

           Dooley reaches the rooftop. Spots the door and...

           SMACK!!! Christian hits him square in the face with a 
           plank of wood. Blood spurts from his nose as he hits the 
           ground hard. 

           Christian triggers his stiletto and turns Dooley over... 

           ...only to find himself staring down the barrel of 
           Dooley’s .45 yet again. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        Knife down, hands up, and back off.

           Christian doesn’t move. Dooley cocks the hammer.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Now.

           Christian lowers the stiletto and steps back. Dooley 
           staggers to his feet, the pain shooting through his head. 
           Christian sizes Dooley up and smiles.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Turn around.

           Christian’s smile turns to a laugh as he steps forward.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        I said turn around.

           Christian takes another step forward.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll shoot you.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        No you won’t.

           Dooley steps forward, closing the gap.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Wanna bet?

           Christian glances down at the trembling gun...
                                 CHRISTIAN
                        All right then...

           ...and presses his chest against the barrel.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Shoot me.

           Dooley looks at him incredulously. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Shall I count to three?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Turn around!

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        One...

                                 DOOLEY
                        Stop!

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Two...

           Dooley shuts his eyes and pulls the trigger... just as 
           Christian drops a hand over the gun. SHUNK! Dooley opens 
           his eyes to see that the web of skin between Christian’s 
           thumb and forefinger has neatly fallen between the hammer 
           and chamber making it impossible to fire.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Three.

           Christian grips the gun and twists it violently to the 
           side. Caught in the trigger guard, Dooley’s finger snaps.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Ahhhh!!

           Dooley drops to his knees releasing the gun to Christian. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        That was quite a run, old boy.

           Christian retrieves his stiletto, grabs Dooley by the 
           collar and swings him out to the edge of the rooftop.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        But this is where the great game ends. 

           Christian flips the gun over in his hand...
                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Zeit zu sterben.

           ...and pulls the trigger. CLICK! Dooley flinches. 
           Christian pulls it again. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re bloody joking.

           FSSST! Christian flinches as a bullet nicks his cheek. 
           It's Agent Conrad firing from an adjacent rooftop.

           ZIP! Christian turns back to Dooley as he . Dooley has 
           just handcuffed himself to Christian. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        You’re under arrest.

           With a PRIMAL SCREAM, Christian throws both of them over 
           the edge of the building.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Dooley!

           Grappled Christian and Dooley free-fall two stories 
           before - CRASH - they smash through the construction 
           scaffolding in an explosion of wooden supports and metal 
           pipes. CRASH-CRASH-WHAM!!

           Christian SLAMS onto a cloth canopy breaking his fall. 
           Dooley just misses it. Christian braces himself as the 
           handcuffs yank Dooley’s falling body to a violent halt.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Ahhhhhh!!

           On the adjacent rooftop, Conrad bolts for the stairs.

           Hanging by his wrist four stories over the alleyway 
           floor, Dooley regains his bearings. 

           With his cuffed hand braced against an iron support, 
           Christian uses his other hand to reach into his pocket - 
           SHIFFFTH - and pull out his stiletto. 

           Dooley spots an open toolbox teetering on the busted 
           scaffold. Inside is a flathead screwdriver.

           With a powerful GRUNT, Christian lifts Dooley upward, 
           just enough to expose his cuffed wrist. Dooley looks up 
           as Christian presses the blade to Dooley's wrist. Panic 
           as Dooley reaches out for the toolbox once again. Still 
           out of reach.
           EXT. SIDEWALK - SAME

           Conrad bursts out the front doors of the adjacent 
           building and races towards the alleyway.

           EXT. ABOVE ALLEYWAY - SAME

           Dooley GASPS as Christian’s blade breaks the skin. 

           SCRREEEEEE! The iron support BENDS beneath their weight. 
           Christian lowers the blade to brace himself. CRRREEEEK - 
           Beside them the eight stories of scaffolding rig starts 
           to give. The toolbox teetering further over the edge. 

           Christian flips the blade in his hand and presses it 
           against Dooley's wrist like a hack-saw.

           SSCCCREEEAAACCCHH!!! As the entire wall of scaffolding 
           finally gives way...

           ...Dooley swings his feet against the building, and 
           pushes himself away towards...

           ...the toolbox as it tips over the edge. Dooley snatches 
           the flat-head screwdriver one millisecond before it 
           falls. 

           SMAAAAAAASH!! The scaffolding bursts apart as it SMASHES 
           against the adjacent building. CRACK! The canopy support 
           snaps forcing Christian to drop his stiletto to grab hold 
           of the remaining support.

           He can now see Dooley below him as he pulls the flat-head 
           screwdriver back like a dagger - and Christian braces 
           himself for the pain.

           CHINK! The flat-head screwdriver jams into the cuffs, 
           right between the interlocking teeth. Dooley yanks the 
           metal arm open...

           ...and drops four stories to the alleyway floor.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY FLOOR - DAY

           As Conrad turns the corner - CRAAASH! He runs through the 
           piles of broken wood and piping, when a HEAVY GROAN leads 
           him over to... Dooley, lying over a row of crushed 
           garbage cans. 

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Dooley! You okay, kid? Can you talk? 

           Conrad looks up towards the canopy. Christian is gone. 
           Dooley rolls over with another GROAN.
                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        Can you say something?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Yeah. What kind of asshole carries around 
                        an unloaded gun?

           Dooley fades...

                                                            ...TO BLACK.

           INT. CHRISTIAN’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Christian moves swiftly... collecting photos, blueprints, 
           and newspaper clippings... and burns it all in the sink.

           Brown leather case in hand, he scans the empty apartment 
           and opens the door to find...

           Tess standing in his doorway. 

                                 TESS
                        I’ve been standing here, God knows how 
                        long, trying to convince myself to turn 
                        around, walk away and never see you 
                        again. Then I decided you don’t get off 
                        so easy.

           Christian hesitates, then takes a step back. Tess enters. 
           He closes the door. She crosses over to the window.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        You’re not really a Government agent, are 
                        you? At least not for the British.

           Christian lowers his case and quietly locks the door.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I wanted to be honest with you. Not from 
                        the start, I confess.

           He approaches her from behind, scanning the room for 
           possible weapons. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        But once I came to know you, it took all 
                        my will just to keep from throwing myself 
                        at your feet and confessing everything. 

           ... a length of twine... a knife on the counter... the 
           iron tea kettle by the stove.
                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        You can’t imagine what a burden it is to 
                        live with such a secret.

           Christian takes the twine from the table. Wraps it 
           tightly around his fingers.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Knowing that the one person you can bear 
                        your soul to may never look at you the 
                        same if you did.

           He snaps the twine taunt between his hands...

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        I like how you see me, Tess. I like who I 
                        am in your eyes.

           ...raises the twine over his head.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        And I wouldn’t want anything to change 
                        that. Not even the truth.

           Tess lays a stack of FGP IDs on the window sill. The same 
           ones Dooley stole from the ID Office.

                                 TESS
                        Let me help you.

           Christian lowers the twine. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        If I told you I knew why you were here... 
                        how you used me to get to it... if there 
                        were no more reasons for you to lie... 
                        would you still want me?

           She turns to face him. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        They want to take away my baby.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Who-

                                 TESS
                        All they do is take. They take without 
                        asking and then shame you for not 
                        thanking them. As if I ever had a choice.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Tess, what are you talking about-
                                 TESS
                        I’m talking about turning my back on my 
                        country and their goddamn war... if you 
                        love me.

           Christian doesn’t move. Tess closes the gap between them.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        They took my first chance at happiness. I 
                        won’t let them take my last. 

           She places her hand against his chest. He takes her in 
           his arms and kisses her. The twine drops to the floor.

           INT. CAMPUS CLASSROOM, SECRET SERVICE HQ - NIGHT

           Secret Service Agent Prescott stands before a 
           sophisticated diagram of the Quad. Conrad begrudgingly 
           listens as Prescott explains.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Twenty uniformed officers along the 
                        outskirts tightens the seal, so every 
                        Tom, Dick and Fritz who wants on that 
                        Quad has to go through your checkpoint.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        What about inside the buildings?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Swept and secured this afternoon. 

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        You gonna sweep and secure ‘em again 
                        tomorrow?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Come tomorrow? That’s your job. 

                                 AGENT ARMSTRONG (O.S.)
                        Hey, Chief!

           Agent Armstrong enters the bustling office with a file.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        What’s this?

                                 AGENT ARMSTRONG
                        University’s file on the recently 
                        deceased Professor Görg.

           Conrad opens the file. His reaction is disbelief.
                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        You’re kidding.

           INT. PROFESSOR GÖRG’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Dooley stares at the chalk outline from behind the dead 
           Professor’s desk. His finger holds his pencil over an 
           empty sketch-book page, waiting for an epiphany.

           Dooley lays down the pencil, reaches into his pocket and 
           pulls out Christian’s stiletto. 

           He feels the weight of it in his hand. His thumb touches 
           the release trigger, when-

                                 FLEMING
                        Reenacting the scene of the crime?

           Dooley turns to see Admiral Fleming in the doorway.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        Or just living vicariously?

                                 DOOLEY
                        It’s reenacting the crime, not the scene 
                        of the crime. We're already at the scene.

           Fleming stares at Dooley with amused curiosity.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        That file you have on me... Does it 
                        mention how I had to enlist three times 
                        before they let me in? Three recruitment 
                        stations in three counties classified me 
                        4-F: Unfit for combat duty. I had him in 
                        my sights, I couldn’t pull the trigger.

                                 FLEMING
                        You ever hear of a fellow named Alan 
                        Turing? Young chap like you. Sharp as a 
                        porcupine and with the social skills to 
                        match. This boy claimed he could build a 
                        machine that could break any code in the 
                        world. An electro-mechanical computing 
                        device he called it. Most of us laughed 
                        him off. Lucky for us Churchill was never 
                        one to laugh. So when this Turing chap 
                        actually built the damn machine, and it 
                        actually worked, I had to ask... How 
                        could a boy incapable of matching his own 
                        socks come up with something so 
                        ingenious? His answer? “From a 
                        contradiction one can deduce anything.” 
           Fleming looks hard at Dooley.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        If we win this war, it’ll be thanks to 
                        the square pegs who never fired a shot.

           Dooley turns back to the empty page in his Sketch-Book.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        Right. Well, in case you were wondering 
                        why I’m here...

           Fleming tosses him a file labeled “Secret-UK Eyes Only”. 

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        Congratulations, Thomas. You’ve earned 
                        yourself a British Intelligence pass.

           Dooley opens the file revealing photos and a dossier on-

                                 DOOLEY
                                 (reads from file)
                        Christian Drake, aka the Wolf. Born 
                        Rothenberg, Germany, 1909. The 
                        illegitimate son of Baron Klaus Von 
                        Heidelmann and English-born Lydia Drake, 
                        a midwife to the Heidelmann estate.

           Fleming eyes the stiletto on the desk.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Characterized by his superiors as 
                        ruthless and charismatic, Von Heidelmann 
                        was recruited by the Gestapo in 1935 and 
                        trained under the Einsatzkommando unit of 
                        the SD.

           SHIFFT! Dooley looks up as Fleming triggers the blade.

                                 FLEMING
                        Signature weapon? Double-action 
                        switchblade. Model OTF.

           SHIFFT! He returns the stiletto to the desk.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        Is that the file on our dead Professor?

           Fleming reaches for a file on the desk, identical to the 
           one Armstrong handed Conrad. Fleming opens the file 
           surprised to find... a single sheet of paper inside.
                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                                 (reads from file)
                        Professor Rudolf Görg, Water Works 
                        Control Engineer. Place of residence: 235 
                        West 53rd Street, room 407.

           Fleming turns the page over, as if expecting more.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        Why would someone with such high level 
                        access have so little in his file?

           Beat.

                                 DOOLEY
                        The Sistine chapel. You know how people 
                        look at that painting and say how amazing 
                        it is, God and Adam touching fingers? 
                        What’s really amazing is that they’re 
                        wrong. Their fingers aren’t even 
                        touching. They’re almost touching. And 
                        that’s what makes it a masterpiece. That 
                        empty space no one notices in between. 

           Dooley draws the fingers in his sketch-book.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        That’s what your friend meant by 
                        contradictions. When all you see are 
                        similarities, look for what’s different. 
                        When faced with differences, look for 
                        similarities. 

           Dooley circles the empty space between the fingers.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        The Professor’s file wasn’t brief because 
                        he was a nobody. It was brief because he 
                        was a somebody. Somebody important enough 
                        the University had to protect with a 
                        dummy file.

                                 FLEMING
                        Or the War Department. They’re the ones 
                        issuing these IDs. 

                                 DOOLEY
                        We need to find out who this Professor 
                        really was. We find that, we’ll find the 
                        Wolf.
                                 FLEMING
                        I’ll have it sent to Washington tonight. 
                        See if the General can’t shed some light 
                        on it. In the meantime, I’ll be needing a 
                        number two for the command team tomorrow, 
                        so...

           CLACK-ACK! Dooley looks up to see a shiny new gun in 
           Fleming’s outstretched hand.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        Know your way around a Walther PPK?

           EXT. UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY 

           The Columbia Marching Band WARMS UP as University Bigwigs 
           shuffle about the stage in anticipation of the President.

           EXT. QUAD CHECKPOINT - DAY

           Police officers direct the crowd of students, faculty, 
           and press towards a barricaded checkpoint.

                                 AGENT ARMSTRONG
                        Have your University and press passes 
                        ready!

           Mimeograph in hand, Agent McCord scrutinizes every face 
           before letting them pass. Conrad catches his eye. McCord 
           shrugs. Conrad turns to the growing crowd, then up to the 
           countless windows that surround the Quad.

           INT. CLASSROOM, 5TH FLOOR - SAME

           Flemings and Dooley stare out the window over the Quad.

                                 DOOLEY
                        He could already be here, you know. He 
                        could’ve come before they set up the 
                        checkpoints and just waited it out.

                                 FLEMING
                        FBI swept the perimeter twice this 
                        morning. That make you feel better?

                                 DOOLEY
                        Not at all.

                                 FLEMING
                        Me either.

                                 DOOLEY
                        I’m going out there.
           They turn away from the window, to the room full of OSS 
           Agents manning telephones and police radios. As Dooley 
           heads out the door, Fleming turns to a Radio Operator.

                                 FLEMING
                        What’s the ETA on the President’s 
                        carriage?

                                 RADIO OPERATOR
                        Crossing 113th street now, Sir.

           Fleming dials a telephone.

                                 FLEMING 
                                 (into phone)
                        Any minute now, General.

           INT. GENERAL DONOVAN'S OFFICE - SAME

           General Donovan on the other end of the line.

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        Call me when you have a visual.

           Donovan hangs up the phone, when- BUZZZ! BUZZZ! BUZZZ! 
           The red telephone at the end of his desk flashes alive.

           EXT. QUAD CHECKPOINT - DAY

           A hand carrying the brown leather case and a vase of 
           flowers walks down the line of waiting people. It’s Tess. 

                                 AGENT ARMSTRONG (O.S.) 
                        Have your ID cards ready!

           Just before the checkpoint, Tess turns to the side 
           entrance of the science building, inserts an FGP ID into 
           the slot - CA-CLUNK - and slips inside.

           INT. QUAD BUILDING - DAY

           Dooley reaches the first floor exit and halts. Conrad’s 
           checkpoint is just 50 yards away. 

           Dooley sees an OSS Agent and approaches him.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Is there a side exit I can use?

           The OSS Agent checks his campus map.

                                 OSS AGENT
                        Down this hall and to your left.
           Dooley heads down the hall and passes a door marked: 
           “Basement - 0100”.

           Dooley freezes, stares at the number “0100”, and races 
           back to the OSS Agent.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Your campus map! Let me see it!

           The Agent hands him his map.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not a time, it’s a room number. All 
                        the basements on campus must start with 
                        zero. So if oh-one-hundred is a room, 
                        then Roosevelt has to be-

           Dooley finds what he’s looking for. He bolts for the 
           front doors and bursts out onto...

           THE QUAD...

           Dooley sprints straight through the crowd and leaps over 
           the checkpoint barrier.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Hey! Hey!!

           Conrad watches Dooley race away from the Quad towards the 
           perimeter outskirts. He turns to Armstrong and McCord.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        If he comes back, shoot him.

           EXT. CAMPUS PERIMETER - DAY

           Far from the excitement of the Quad, a YOUNG POLICE 
           OFFICER guards the perimeter outskirts. Behind him 
           Christian slips between buildings. Sensing movement, the 
           Officer turns and follows...

           AROUND THE CORNER...

           Where Christian faces the locked doors of a building. He 
           inserts the dead Professor’s FGP ID into the key-card 
           slot mounted by the doors. Unsure, the Young Officer 
           checks his mimeograph. 

                                 YOUNG OFFICER
                        Say-

           By the time he looks up, Christian is on him - THUNK - 
           jabbing the Young Officer in the windpipe.
                                 YOUNG OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Guuuukkkk...

           Christian crouches, then strikes upward with the palm of 
           his hand, shattering the Young Officer’s nose, thrusting 
           the shattered bone up into his brain.

           EXT. CAMPUS PERIMETER - DAY

           Dooley sprints past two Police Officers.

                                 OFFICER
                        Hey!

           The Officers exchange looks and run after him.

           INT. BUILDING - DAY

           Christian crosses the hall to a door marked: “Water Works 
           - 0100”. Using the dead Professor’s ID - CA-LUNK - he 
           steps inside.

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           Christian reaches the bottom of the stairs. Water pipes 
           are everywhere. The SOUND of RUSHING WATER is deafening. 
           The room is identical to the one Dooley used to escape 
           into the sewers. Christian approaches a large pipe with a 
           key-card slot.

           EXT. BUILDING - DAY

           Dooley turns the corner and stops. Slowly he approaches 
           the building, revealing for the first time the name above 
           the entrance...

           “Theodore Roosevelt Building”

           CRUNCH. Dooley looks down to see the hand of the dead 
           Young Officer beneath his shoe. As Dooley turns to SCREAM 
           FOR HELP...

           EXT. QUAD CHECKPOINT - SAME

           Conrad turns to the sound of... DEAFENING CHEERS as the 
           President’s carriage appears in the distance, Agent 
           Prescott and his team accompanying by foot.

           EXT. PHYSICAL PLANT - DAY 

           The two officers turn the corner, see the dead Young 
           Officer.
                                 OFFICER 1

                        Go to the checkpoint! Find Agent Conrad 
                        and get him down here! Now!!

           The Officers head for the Quad. Dooley’s eyes dart from 
           the name of the building... to a man-hole on the 
           sidewalk... to the street that runs all the way down to 
           the Quad...

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.

           INT. SEWER SYSTEM - DAY

           As Christian moves through the underground sewer tunnels. 

           ABOVE GROUND...

           Agent Conrad oversees his checkpoint, oblivious to the 
           breach occurring directly beneath his feet.

           EXT. QUAD, CHECKPOINT - DAY

           As the President’s carriage approaches, the Officers 
           reach Conrad. They explain beneath the DIN of the Crowd. 

           INT. SEWER TUNNELS - DAY 

           Christian turns a corner to... A DEAD END.

           He looks around for another passageway when - CA-LANK - A 
           hidden door opens behind him. It’s Tess with his brown 
           leather case, FGP IDs, and her vase of flowers.

           EXT. ROOSEVELT BUILDING - DAY

           Conrad follows the Officers to the dead body. But no 
           Dooley.

                                 OFFICER 1
                        He was just here.

           Conrad sees the name above the entrance: “Roosevelt”. The 
           key-card slot by the door. And... 

           ...the open man-hole on the sidewalk. Conrad runs to the 
           open hole then raises his eyes to the street to see... 

           ...Storm Drains along the sidewalk curb, all the way down 
           to the Quad. 
                                 AGENT ARMSTRONG
                        He’s breached the perimeter.

           INT. SEWER TUNNELS - DAY 

           Dooley sprints down the sewer tunnels towards the Quad.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (V.O.)
                        His nest isn’t above ground. It’s below.

           INT. SEWER TUNNEL, UNDER QUAD - DAY

           Christian and Tess reach their destination. Heavy pipes 
           to their right, an open storm drain to their left. 
           Through the storm drain, Tess sees the wheels of the 
           President’s carriage roll to a stop.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (V.O.) 
                        He’s going to shoot from a storm drain.

           Christian sets the brown leather case on the sewer ledge.

           INT. SEWER TUNNEL - SAME

           Dooley reaches a padlocked door marked: “Hydroelectrics”.

           INT. OSS CONTROL ROOM - DAY

                                 OSS RADIO OPERATOR
                        Raven has reached the nest.

           Fleming picks up the phone and dials. RING-RING!

           INT. GENERAL DONOVAN’S OFFICE - SAME 

           RING-RING! Donovan's phone goes unanswered. He’s not 
           there.

           INT. OFFICE OF THE WAR SECRETARY - SAME

           The War Secretary raises the dead Professor’s file as 
           General Donovan enters his office.

                                 WAR SECRETARY
                        How did you get hold of this?

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN 
                        Professor Görg was found dead in his 
                        apartment yesterday. Agent Dooley thought 
                        his file may have been doctored.

                                 WAR SECRETARY
                        And it has nothing to do with this German 
                        spy?
                                 GENERAL DONOVAN
                        I don’t know, Mr. Secretary. Does it?

           The War Secretary looks at him gravely.

                                 GENERAL DONOVAN (CONT’D)
                        For God’s sakes, Henry. If there’s 
                        something you need to tell me...

           The War Secretary reaches for a switch beneath his desk.

           INT. RECEPTION ROOM OUTSIDE WAR SECRETARY’S OFFICE - SAME 

           BUZZ-BUZZ! A RED LIGHT above the War Secretary’s office 
           flashes alive. Two Marines by the door snap to attention. 
           The Receptionist flips a switch under her own desk- CLICK-
           CLICK- locking all doors. The room is secure.

                                 WAR SECRETARY (V.O.)
                        What I’m about to tell you, General, is 
                        beyond any level of security. 

           EXT. BEHIND STAGE PLATFORM - SAME

           TIME SLOWS TO A GRIND AS... Prescott scans the crowd and 
           nods to an Agent who reaches for the carriage door.

           INT. SEWER TUNNEL UNDER QUAD - SAME

           Tess watches, as Christian reaches into his jacket...

                                 WAR SECRETARY (V.O.)
                        Something only a handful of people in the 
                        entire country know about.

           INT. SEWER TUNNEL - SAME

           BAM-BAM! Dooley shoots the lock, kicks the door open and 
           bursts inside to find... the room empty.

           EXT. BEHIND STAGE PLATFORM - DAY

           CLICK. The handle of the carriage door turns as...

           INT. SEWER TUNNEL UNDER QUAD - SAME

           Christian removes an FGP ID bearing... the symbol for 
           RADIOACTIVE! He inserts it into a control box on the wall 
           - POP - revealing a power switch, also bearing the symbol 
           for RADIOACTIVE. 

           Tess follows the pipes along the walls to the end of the 
           tunnel, where they converge over... A HUGE MAGNETIC 
           VAULT, which also bears the symbol for RADIOACTIVE. 
                                 WAR SECRETARY (V.O.)
                        I’m going to teach you a new word today, 
                        General...

           TIME SHIFTS BACK INTO SPEED... As Christian pulls the 
           switch... THHHHUNK!!! Water lock gears GRIND to a halt, 
           causing the ground beneath their feet to SHUDDER. 

           DOOLEY...

           Hears it through the walls.

           FLEMING... 

           Sees it as the lights flicker, and the radios go out.

           PRESCOTT...

           Feels it beneath the ROAR of the crowd. 

           INT. WAR SECRETARY’S OFFICE - SAME

                                 WAR SECRETARY
                        Atom-bomb.

           INT. SEWER TUNNEL UNDER QUAD - SAME

           CHUUURRRRRRNNNNNN... The magnetic vault POWERS DOWN. CAL-
           ANK! The vault door swings open... SPLAAASSHHH!!! Spewing 
           out gallons of water. Tess SCREAMS as Christian pulls her 
           from the path of the rushing water.

           EXT. STAGE PLATFORM - DAY

           A confused bureaucrat taps the dead microphone on stage. 
           That’s enough for Prescott who lunges for the carriage 
           door - SLAM - and leaps onto the side of the carriage.

                                 PRESCOTT
                                 (to Driver)
                        Go! Go! Go!

           INT. SEWER TUNNEL UNDER QUAD - SAME

           Christian climbs into the vault chamber and opens a door 
           on the other side to reveal...  

           A WHITE LABORATORY...

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        “Der Donner der Götter.” 

           Tess’ eyes grow wide at the sight of...
           A HUGE GRAPHITE SPHERE in the center of the underground 
           lab.

                                 CHRISTIAN  (CONT’D)
                        Thunder of the gods.

           Directly above the lab... through 20 feet of concrete and 
           30 feet of earth... is the Blue Lion painted across the 
           50 yard-line of the Columbia football field... 

           The atomic lab sits directly under the University Quad.

           INT. ATOMIC LABORATORY - DAY

           CLICK-CLICK. Christian circles the ATOMIC PILE, SNAPPING 
           photos with a micro-camera. 

           Tess stares up at the giant sphere, overwhelmed. CRRRAK-
           AK-AK-AK... Tess looks down at a Geiger counter. The 
           needle dancing to the CRACKLING sound.

           A KEY RATTLES the far doorway.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Flowers!

           Tess doesn’t move. Christian grabs the vase from her 
           hands. SMASH! Water, flowers, and his 9mm handgun spill 
           across the floor. Tess’ jaw drops. TWO SECURITY GUARDS, 
           one OLDER, one YOUNGER enter the room to find Tess alone.

                                 OLDER SECURITY GUARD
                        Who the hell are you?

           Christian steps out from behind the door, gun aimed at 
           the Young Guard’s head. Tess SCREAMS. BAK-BAK! The Older 
           Guard spins as Christian takes aim. BAK-BAK-BAK!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BAK... BAK... BAK... Christian SHOOTS the lock off every 
           filing cabinet in the room until he spots one with a key-
           card slot. He pulls an FGP ID with the name: “Dr. Enrico 
           Fermi” CA-CLUNK - and opens the cabinet to find... A 
           single thick, orange file. He opens the file and smiles.

           Christian sets the brown leather case on a table and pops 
           the latches to reveal... a short wave radio. Tess watches 
           as he flips the battery and lifts the headset to his ear.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Nothing more to worry about. The hardest 
                        part’s over.
           He turns the frequency dial and TAPS out his message.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Soon we’ll be safe, far away from here.

           Tess eyes the atomic file by his side. Christian catches 
           her stare. His eyes darken with suspicion.

           BAM-BAM! SCREEE! The radio explodes in a burst of sparks 
           and FEEDBACK as bullets rip through the case. Tess 
           stumbles back against the floor. Christian dives behind a 
           filing cabinet. Dooley hops down from the vault.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Christian Von Heidelmann. You’re under-

           BAK-BAK-BAK! Dooley dives behind the atomic pile. BAM-
           BAM! CLICK. Dooley fumbles for another clip. Christian 
           eyes the exit and looks around for... the atomic file, 
           lying on the floor between him and Tess. But Tess’ eyes 
           are on Dooley across the room. “He’s still alive...” 

                                 CHRISTIAN 
                        Tess!

           Dooley leaps around the atomic pile, shocked to see Tess. 
           Tess looks to Christian, then the file at her feet. 
           Christian thrusts out his arm.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Tess.

                                 DOOLEY
                        No!

           BAK-BAK-BAK! Dooley falls back behind the pile. CLICK! 
           Christian hits empty. Dooley leaps out and takes aim when-

           Tess leaps to her feet, grabs the atomic file, and runs 
           to Christian at the door.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        No!

           Unable to shoot, Dooley gives chase.

           EXT. SCIENCE BUILDING - DAY

           Christian and Tess burst out of the science building and 
           into the dense crowd leaving the Quad. Dooley exits a 
           moment later. Christian and Tess are gone.
           EXT. QUAD - AFTERNOON

           Dooley sits in a daze amidst the chaos of FBI, OSS and 
           Secret Service Agents. Fleming crosses the Quad to Dooley 
           and WHISPERS intensely in his ear. Conrad watches as 
           Dooley’s eyes grow wide.

           EXT. QUAD - AFTERNOON

           A black sedan SCREECHES to a halt. Armstrong and McCord 
           climb out as Dooley and Conrad take their places.

                                 AGENT MCCORD
                        What’s going on?  

           Dooley scribbles down a message in his sketch-book.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Contact all listening stations in the tri-
                        state area. Tell them to wire all 
                        intercepts within the last half hour to 
                        Arlington hall...

           Dooley rips the page and hands it to Armstrong.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        ... along with this.

           Dooley dives into the sedan as Conrad hits the gas. 

                                 AGENT ARMSTRONG
                                 (reading message)
                        Holy cannoli.

           INT. OSS COMMAND CENTER - AFTERNOON 

           Fleming speaks into a phone.

                                 FLEMING
                        No, Sir, this is not a drill. We need all 
                        bridges, railways, and airports shut 
                        down. That’s right, Mr. Mayor, seal the 
                        city.

           EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - EARLY EVENING

           Police cars screech to a halt barricading all traffic 
           coming on or off the bridge.

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE, TRAIN LINE - EARLY EVENING

           Passengers react as the lights go out, and the train 
           grinds to a halt.
           EXT. EAST RIVER - EARLY EVENING

           COAST GUARD SHIPS pull along-side ferry boats.

                                 LOUD SPEAKER
                        Cease and desist from your present course 
                        and return to shore. Repeat. Cease-

           INT. STATION X - EARLY EVENING

           The teletype machine punches out a message. Vassar tears 
           the page, as Harvard and Yale huddle in close.

                                 VASSAR
                                 (reads aloud)
                        Dear fellas, you have ten minutes to 
                        break this code and save the world. Get 
                        cracking. Dooley.

           EXT. EAST SIDE DOCKS - EARLY EVENING

           The Black Sedan SCREECHES to a halt by a shipyard. As 
           Conrad hops out, Dooley slides behind the wheel.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        What are you doing?

           Dooley struggles with the clutch.

                                 DOOLEY
                        You got it covered here, right? Sealing 
                        the city and all?

           Conrad grabs the door handle. Dooley locks it.

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Even if it were possible to seal the 
                        city, he’d find a way out. 

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Where are you going?

                                 DOOLEY
                        To make a phone call.

           Dooley pops the clutch and peels out.

           EXT. PRIVATE DOCKS - DUSK

           Tess follows Christian along a private dock of yachts and 
           sail boats. He halts before a 36-Foot motor cruiser.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        That should do.
                                 TESS
                        Do? Do for what?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                                 (Boarding the cruiser)
                        Quick enough to get us there in time. 
                        Small enough not to be spotted after 
                        dark. Untie that line.

           Tess remains on the dock, the atomic file in her hands.

                                 TESS
                        Christian, what are you talking about? 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I’m talking about getting us out of here. 
                        Now stop dallying and get on the boat!

                                 TESS
                        What about Charlie? 

           Christian stops cold. He forgot all about the boy.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        What made you think I’d leave without my 
                        baby?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Right now everyone from the FBI to the 
                        bloody boy scouts is looking for a German 
                        spy and his female accomplice. So unless 
                        you want to make your son an orphan, I 
                        suggest we discuss it on the boat.

                                 TESS
                        Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. I know 
                        what I’ve done, and I’ve accepted the 
                        consequences. But I’m not going anywhere 
                        without my baby.

           He glances at the file held tight in her hands.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        You’re right. You’ve risked everything 
                        for me, and I can’t deny what that means. 
                        I love you, Tess. But if we don’t deliver 
                        that file right now, we will not make it 
                        out alive. I promise, the moment they 
                        have it we’ll turn around and head back 
                        to shore. They’ll agree to another 
                        rendezvous, only if we deliver the file.

           He reaches out for her with an understanding smile.

                        What’s “behind the lady” mean?

           EXT. BATTERY PARK - DUSK

           Dooley reaches the gate along the water’s edge. He scans 
           the horizon and spots a solitary boat on its way to 
           Liberty Island. Dooley leaps over the gate, racing past a

                        What?

           He places her hands on the wheel.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Don’t steer. Just keep her steady. We’re 
                        almost there, Tess.

           With a reassuring smile he heads for deck. On his way out 
           he grabs the atomic file and slips it under his shirt.

           Christian takes a running leap off the deck...

           EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT

           ...and onto the Island. Christian scans the speedboat 
           wreckage and spots Dooley’s Walther PPK. SMACK! Dooley 
           blind-sides him with the boat’s rudder. Christian 
           stumbles. Dooley swings again. Christian catches it and 
           twists himself around, hyper-extending Dooley’s elbow.

                                 DOOLEY 
                        Yahhhhh!

           SMACK! Christian clocks him with the rudder. Dooley hits 
           the ground hard. He struggles to regain focus and spots 
           the Walther PPK, as... Christian lifts him by the collar.

                                 DOOLEY  (CONT’D)
                        You’re under arrest.

                        You’re still under arrest.
           Christian HEAD BUTTS him. Dooley goes cross-eyed with 
           pain. Dooley fumbles for his pocket, as Christian lifts 
           him in a crushing bear hug.

           Christian’s massive arms crush Dooley’s rib cage, 
           expelling the air from his lungs. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        How’s it feel, little man?

           Dooley GASPS, managing to remove his bandaged hand from 
           his pocket, as... Christian gets a better grip and 
           SQUEEZES again. Dooley SCREAMS, swiping his bandaged hand 
           free. Christian lets out a PRIMAL SCREAM of his own and 
           tosses Dooley to the ground.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        All right then.

           Out of breath himself, Christian picks up Dooley’s gun.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see if we were smarter this time.

           He checks the clip. It’s loaded.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Good boy.

           Christian takes aim. Dooley raises a blood-soaked hand to 
           shield himself. Christian hesitates, confused by the 
           amount of blood on Dooley’s arm and the glimmer of an 
           object in Dooley’s hand. It’s Christian’s stiletto.

           Christian touches his stomach. Stares at his own blood in 
           disbelief. Dooley has gutted him with his own weapon. 
           Christian takes a step and stumbles to the grass.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Zeit zu sterben.

           Christian collapses in a puddle of his own blood. 

           Dooley struggles to his feet and turns to see Tess 
           staring at Christian’s body in shock. 

                                 DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s all right. It’s over-

           She raises the 9mm handgun, stopping him in his tracks.
                                 TESS
                        He loved me.

                                 DOOLEY
                        He used you.

                                 TESS
                        NO!

           Tears pour down her cheeks. The gun shakes violently in 
           her hand. Until she releases the gun and throws herself 
           onto Christian with a WAIL.

           BOOOM!! Explosions light the sky as a COAST GUARD VESSEL 
           fires on the U-boat. The blast rolls over them like 
           THUNDER. But Tess is oblivious to everything but her 
           pain. Dooley watches her SOB over Christian’s body.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           Dooley holds a compress to his head. Across the way sits 
           Tess in the back of an ambulance. Her face drained of 
           emotion as a FEMALE MEDIC drapes a blanket over her 
           shoulders. Tess looks up, as Christian’s covered body is 
           carried off the ferry on a stretcher.

           Conrad approaches Dooley.

                        Either way, they’ll probably give you a 
                        medal for it. And if they don’t, I will. 

                                 DOOLEY 
                        I don’t feel like a hero. I feel sick.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Who said being a hero was supposed to 
                        feel good? If it were that easy they 
                        wouldn’t give medals for it.

           Conrad follows Dooley’s gaze towards Tess.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        We’ll need to take her back to 
                        Washington.

                                 DOOLEY
                        I know.
                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        She’ll probably be charged with-

                                 DOOLEY
                        I know. 

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Nobody forced her.

                                 DOOLEY
                        You didn’t have to have her fired.

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Have who fired?

           Dooley looks at him confused.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        Ah. Almost forgot. 

           Conrad hands Dooley a message from his pocket.

                                 AGENT CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        Your code breaker pals wired this over. 
                        Not that it matters now.

           Before Dooley can read the message...

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Agent Conrad.

           They turn to see TWO SERIOUS-LOOKING MEN IN HOOVER BLUES.

                                 SERIOUS HOOVER BLUE
                        The Director wants a word with you and 
                        Agent Dooley.

           INT. BLACK LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Dooley and Conrad slide into the back of the black limo. 
           A GRAVELY VOICE comes from the front. 

                                 GRAVELY VOICE
                        I thought I had your loyalty, Agent 
                        Conrad. I thought we agreed this case 
                        would be closed. That our focus would 
                        stay on the real, internal threat.

           FBI Director J. EDGAR HOOVER turns to face them.

                                 HOOVER
                        Care to explain yourself?
                                 DOOLEY
                        He did what he did for his country. 

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Dooley-

                                 DOOLEY
                        He’s got nothing to explain.

                                 HOOVER
                        Is that so...

           He tosses the atomic file onto Dooley’s lap. 

                                 HOOVER (CONT’D)
                        Explain that.

           Dooley opens the file to find... POETRY. No formulas, no 
           scientific data, just pages of handwritten poetry.

                                 DOOLEY
                        What is this? Where’s the file?

                                 HOOVER
                        You tell me.

           He leafs through the pages and halts. He holds up a page 
           ripped out of his own Sketch-Book. The portrait of...

           ...Tess holding her baby with the melancholy smile on her 
           face. The one entitled: “La Pietà”...

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Jesus Christ.

           Conrad bolts out the limo. Dooley pulls the note from his 
           pocket and reads.

                                 DOOLEY
                        Not German.

           EXT. DOCKS - MOMENTS LATER

           Conrad reaches the ambulance. Tess is gone. 

                                 AGENT CONRAD
                        Lock down the area! Suspect is a white 
                        female, early twenties, and dangerous.

           Agents scramble in all directions. All except Dooley who 
           picks up her discarded blanket. A rueful LAUGH escapes 
           his throat. They won’t catch her. She’s a professional.
           INT. NEW JERSEY TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - DAY

           Tess watches as a train pulls into the station, Charlie 
           bouncing in her arms. A flood of PASSENGERS pour out onto 
           the platform. A YOUNG WOMAN Tess’ age steps off the 
           train. Her eyes search the crowd. Behind her is HER 
           FAMILY. Tess kisses Charlie on the cheek. 

                                 TESS
                        Ready to meet your family, Charlie? 

           The Young Woman spots Tess and is overcome by emotion.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Chlopczyk... Chlopczyk!

           The Woman rushes to Tess, her arms open wide... and lifts 
           Charlie right out of her hands. The family smothers 
           little Charlie in a tearful embrace. 

                                 TESS 
                        He was an angel.

           None of them seem to hear or even notice her. Tess 
           quietly backs away and watches from against the wall.

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Amazing how open the peasant class can be 
                        with their emotions.

           Mr. Polski appears beside her. Tess remains unfazed.

                                 TESS
                        You say it as if they should be ashamed.

                                 MR. POLSKI
                        It’s merely an insight into the 
                        sentimental nature of their breed.

           He slides a hand into her bag... beneath the copy of 
           Leaves of Grass... Mr. Polski pulls out the ATOMIC FILE. 

           He opens it: Mathematical equations, atomic blueprints, 
           and Christian’s micro-camera. Mr. Polski breaks into 
           perfect Russian...

                                 MR. POLSKI (CONT’D)
                                 (Russian w/subtitles)
                        Your ability to use the German to our 
                        advantage exceeded even my expectations.

           Tess answers him in perfect Russian.
                                 TESS
                                 (Russian w/subtitles)
                        You always were stingy with your 
                        expectations, Roman.

                                 MR. POLSKI
                                 (Russian w/subtitles)
                        I admit you had me worried. You’ve always 
                        been rebellious, my dear. And you’ve been 
                        Tess for so long, the temptation to start 
                        believing the fantasy must be...

           He searches her face for a clue. But her eyes remain 
           fixed on Charlie and his family.

                                 MR. POLSKI (CONT’D)
                                 (Russian w/subtitles)
                        No matter. With the Wolf dead, the 
                        Americans have their 13th man. And we?

           Mr. Polski lowers the file as a MAN IN A BROWN SUIT walks 
           past and snatches it into the fold of a newspaper. 

                                 MR. POLSKI (CONT’D)
                        We have what we came for.

           Neither acknowledge the Man as he heads for his train.

                                 MR. POLSKI (CONT’D)
                        Hitler still thinks he can win this war. 
                        But the truth is, it’s all about the war 
                        to come.

           He slips something into her bag. She looks down to see a 
           ticket: “White Starline Passage - New York to Portugal.”

                                 TESS
                        What makes you think I’d go back?

                                 MR. POLSKI
                        What’s to keep you here? A phantom 
                        husband? A child that was never yours? 
                        Here you’re nobody. But in Russia you’re 
                        a hero.

           He turns to face her and freezes. Tess has disappeared.

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        All aboard!

           He scans the crowded station for her. He looks towards 
           Charlie and his real family, but they, too, are gone.
           His eyes stop on a waste basket. Reaching inside he pulls 
           out the passage to Portugal, torn in half.

           As the last train in the station lurches from its 
           platform, the Man In Brown takes his seat by the window. 
           He places his newspaper in a black leather briefcase and - 
           SNAP - locks it shut.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.
