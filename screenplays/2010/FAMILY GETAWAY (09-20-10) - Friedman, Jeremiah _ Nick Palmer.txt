           INT. VIRGIN AIR FLIGHT 215 - FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY

           A SEXY STEWARDESS carrying a tray with a single glass of 
           champagne slinks her way past rows of weary TRAVELERS.

           VIN AJITO, Japanese, 20’s, spent every second of his life 
           pampered by minions, sits next to a massive bodyguard, SONNY.  
           Vin’s dressed like Keith Richards and watching The Wire.  

           The stewardess leans over Sonny, hands Vin his champagne, 
           exposing the black lace of her bra.  A wicked smile and she’s 
           gone.  Vin gets up and Sonny starts to follow.

                                 VIN (IN JAPANESE)
                        Easy.  I’ve got this one.  

                                 SONNY (IN JAPANESE)
                        Sir, your father ordered us--

                                 VIN
                        Relax, Sonny, let me have some fun.

           Sonny grudgingly relents and pulls out an in-flight magazine. 

                                 SONNY
                        Lucky motherfucker.  

           INT. VIRGIN AIR FLIGHT 215 - GALLEY - DAY

           The stewardess and Vin going at it.  She pulls him toward the 
           bathroom just as BEN MANDEL, 29, stumbles out, awkwardly 
           squeezing past the horny couple.  

                                 BEN
                        Might want to give it a few minutes 
                        to air out.  Sorry.  

           The stewardess and Vin head for the other bathroom as Ben 
           lumbers his way down the narrow aisle back to

           THE FIRST CLASS CABIN

           Scruffy, wrinkled and possibly stoned, Ben's a real-life 
           Where’s Waldo amongst the rich and beautiful of First Class.  
           The kind of guy who sports shorts and sandals twelve months a 
           year and gets by on a steady diet of Hot Pockets and beer.  

           He sits across the aisle from Sonny, notices a silver plate 
           waiting on his tray.  He waves down a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey man.  Think there was some kind 
                        of mistake.  I didn’t order lunch.  
                                 MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        No mistake, sir.  Lunch is 
                        complementary.  

           Ben leans close to the attendant, lowers his voice.

                                 BEN
                        You know, I’m not a real first 
                        class guy.  I just got bumped.

                                 MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Yes, sir.  

                                 BEN
                        Right on.    

           Sonny grabs the attendant’s arm as he lowers his plate.

                                 SONNY (IN JAPANESE)
                        No peanuts.

                                 MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT (IN JAPANESE)
                        Yes, sir.  

           He backs away, terrified. 

           Sonny is about to eat when Ben playfully slaps his shoulder.  

                                 BEN
                             (proudly)
                        Peanut.  

           Silence.  Sonny’s clearly not a people person.  It’s awkward.

                                 BEN (IN BAD JAPANESE) (CONT’D)
                        Peanut?

           Ben holds up a small package of airline nuts.  

                                 SONNY (IN JAPANESE)
                        Ah.  Peanut.  

                                 BEN
                        Been trying to learn some Japanese.     
                        Not really a language guy.

           Sonny grabs his throat.  Pretends to choke and cough.  Like 
           charades.  Maybe he is a people person after all.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Oh right, you’re allergic.  
                        Allergic.  You know...
           Ben jingles the nuts, then pretends to choke.  Sonny smiles, 
           nods his giant head and returns to his meal.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s cool.  I’m not so good with 
                        milk.  Hey, how do you say milk?  

           Ben tries to charade his way to milk, but Sonny’s back to 
           pretending to choke.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Right, right.  Allergic.  Got it. 

           Sonny jumps to his feet.  He’s not pretending.  He’s really 
           choking.  His face is swelling up, turning red.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Man, you alright?  

           The attendant returns along with Vin and the sexy stewardess.

                                 VIN 
                        Sonny?  Get a doctor! 

           PASSENGERS stand to watch.  The flight staff races through 
           the aisle.  Lots of shouting in Japanese.  Panic.   

                                 BEN
                        Um, he doesn’t look so hot.   

           A bout of turbulence shakes the plane.  Sonny falls to his 
           knees.  If he doesn’t get air soon, he’s a dead man.

           A hand grabs a pen from the flight attendant’s pocket, 
           quickly disassembles it and with a few deft moves uses it to 
           give Sonny an emergency tracheotomy, saving his life.  

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL our slacker, Ben Mandel, the unlikely 
           savior.  Passengers stare in awe.  A few even stand to clap.    

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Might want to land soon.  

           EXT. TOKYO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TARMAC - EVENING

           The plane’s surrounded by PASSENGERS and EMERGENCY WORKERS.  
           Vin and Ben watch as Sonny is rushed to an ambulance.  

                                 VIN
                        You’re one bad ass doctor homeboy.

                                 BEN
                        Nah, just watch a lot of MacGyver.
           Vin considers this strange, American doofus.  Judgment: 

                                 VIN
                        I like you.  Where you staying?

                                 BEN
                        My buddy told me about a hostel.

           A laugh as he leads Ben to a limo.  Vin doesn’t do hostels.  

           EXT. TOKYO STREETS - NIGHT

           The limo speeds between the shimmering Sumida River and 
           flashing LCD BOARDS and glowing SKYSCRAPERS of downtown.   

           INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

           Ben sits opposite Vin, who’s nestled among a seat of MODELS.

                                 VIN
                        Sonny’s like the Stringer to my 
                        Avon.  You saved his life so that 
                        makes you my Wee-Bey.  Feel me?

           Yeah, Ben's got absolutely no idea what that means.  

                                 BEN
                        Right on. 

           The limo slows outside --

           EXT. XSCAPE - NIGHT

           The snaking line of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE tells us this is Tokyo’s 
           hottest club.  And Vin owns it.  Or at least his father does.

           The CROWD parts for Vin, like the Red Sea for Moses.    

                                 VIN
                             (to Ben)
                        Welcome to the family, baby.  

           A MONORAIL speeds over the track above as they enter --

           INT. XSCAPE - NIGHT

           Three stories of glass-encased decadence and techno beats.    

           A FULL-SIZED SUBWAY CAR - packed with EROTIC SCHOOLGIRLS and 
           HORNY BUSINESSMAN - borders a DANCE FLOOR of pulsing HOTTIES.
           DANCERS twist on CHAINS hanging from the ceiling.  Cirque du 
           Soleil goes S&M.  One unfolds over Ben, upside down, lips 
           inches from his... 

                                 BEN
                        Hi.  Um... Should I tip her?  

           No time.  He follows Vin and the girls to a 

           PRIVATE STAIRCASE climbing the far wall of the club.

           GUARDS stop the girls, move to stop Ben --

                                 VIN
                        He’s cool.

           Vin leads Ben UPSTAIRS...

                                 VIN (CONT’D)
                        Club’s just the tip of the iceberg.  
                        We got our hands in a little bit of 
                        everything. 

           THE THIRD FLOOR - a LOFT overlooking the dance floor below.

           More GUARDS.  This time armed.  Ben nervously eyes the 
           hardware as they sweep him with METAL DETECTORS.   

                                 VIN (CONT’D)
                        My pops is O.G.  Doesn’t like 
                        guests.

                                 BEN
                        Maybe I should wait downstairs.

                                 VIN
                        Relax.  Like I said.  You’re 
                        family.

           Vin leads Ben across the GLASS FLOOR - fog rolling between 
           the layers of glass for privacy - toward a couch where --

           TAKASHI AJITO, 60’s, finishes a deal with a BURMESE GENERAL. 

                                 VIN (CONT’D)
                        Father!  The prodigal son returns!

                                 TAKASHI
                        General.  If you’ll excuse me.

           Takashi rises, clearly not happy about the interruption.  He 
           moves slowly and speaks quietly, hallmarks of his power.  
                                 TAKASHI (CONT’D)
                        Who is this?

           Ben offers an awkward wave.  Not sure on the protocol.

                                 VIN
                        Relax.  He’s harmless.

                                 BEN
                        Great place.  Love all the glass. 

           The Burmese General joins Takashi and Vin.

                                 BURMESE GENERAL
                        I didn’t know you had a son.

                                 TAKASHI
                        Yes, sometimes I forget myself. 

           Takashi puts an arm around the General, leading him out.

                                 TAKASHI (CONT’D)
                        Next time, you’ll have to join me 
                        on my boat.  I’ll be in touch about 
                        the first shipment.

           They shake and the General exits, flanked by BODYGUARDS.  

           Takashi’s smile disappears as he BACKHANDS Vin.

                                 TAKASHI (CONT’D)
                        Thank God your mother isn’t alive 
                        to see your shame.  
                             (nodding to Ben)
                        Search him!

           GUARDS search Ben, come up with tissues, peanut packets...

                                 BEN
                        Long flight.

           One of the guys smiles.  And what happens next is over in the 
           blink of an eye: Ben strikes.  One.  Two.  Three.  The guards 
           go down and Ben's got a gun aimed straight at Takashi’s head.    

                                 TAKASHI
                        How much do you--

           Ben FIRES.  Two to the chest.  One to the head.  Takashi 
           drops to the glass floor, dead.  

           Ben SPINS to Vin, ready to fire, but stops when he sees --

           Vin, sobbing and rushing to his father, cradling his body.  
           ON Ben, frozen by Vin’s emotion... when MACHINE GUN FIRE 
           snaps him back.  GUARDS tearing up the stairs, guns blazing. 

           BEN SHOOTS OUT THE GLASS FLOOR UNDER HIS FEET dropping into --

           INT. XSCAPE - SECOND FLOOR HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Glass corridor leading to the stairs and dance floor below...

           Walls EXPLODING around Ben, he RACES past the stairs, DIVES -- 

           FIRING rounds as he catches a CHAIN and SLIDES down to the 

           TOP OF THE SUBWAY CAR

           RUNNING WITH Ben as he fires at the glass wall ahead, LEAPS --

           EXT. ELEVATED MONORAIL TRACK - CONTINUOUS

           Rolling onto the track just as a TRAIN bears down on him.  

           THUGS rushing from the club, COPS barreling up the stairs...

           Ben eyes the train, a game of chicken with 90 mph of Japanese 
           steel until... a split-second before impact HE JUMPS --

           The TRAIN ROCKETING PAST, cutting off the thugs and cops --

           Ben FREE-FALLING as we FREEZE FRAME on his scruffy face...

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        Okay, by now you’re probably 
                        wondering what a guy like me’s 
                        doing with a job like this.  

           Ben drops onto a TRASH BARGE chugging up the Sumida River. 

                                 BEN  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Think about it...

           INT. EUROPEAN TRAIN - DINING CAR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           A COLUMBIAN CARTEL KINGPIN dines with his FRENCH DISTRIBUTOR.   
           BODYGUARDS at surrounding tables, alert, eyes scanning...

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        Matt Damon walks into a room, where 
                        do you think everyone’s looking? 

           The guards take notice as a young, MATT DAMON TYPE GUY 
           enters.  Square jaw.  Cool haircut.  Carb-free body.   
                                 BEN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, that dude’s definitely going 
                        to kill somebody.  No question.   

           Guards pass right by Ben, napping at a table, iPod blasting, 
           ragged backpack at his feet, sandwich crumbs on his shirt. 

                                 BEN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Me?  Not so much. 

           Guards heading straight for Matt Damon Guy when -- 

           THE CAR GOES DARK AS THE TRAIN SPEEDS THROUGH A TUNNEL.  

           Back to light.  Guards all over Damon Guy.  A WOMAN SCREAMS 
           and we PULL OUT TO REVEAL --

           Kingpin and distributor face down in their soup.  Ben gone.  

           EXT. OUTSIDE TOKYO/JAPANESE FISHING VILLAGE - DAWN (PRESENT)

           JAPANESE FISHERMEN watch Ben awkwardly flounder to dry land

                        less glamorous than the movies.

           EXT. RURAL JAPANESE ROAD - MORNING

           Ben limps under a steady downpour.  Not a soul in sight.  

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        Take Bond.  Dude’s back-up was so 
                        bad ass the guy’s name was a single 
                        letter.  All I’ve got is this 
                        guy...

           A RENTAL CAR pulls up, hip-hop blasting.  At the wheel, STEW 
           JAYARAMAN, Indian, 20’s, enthusiastic about... everything. 

                                 STEW

                        Moved to America and sent Stew to 
                        M.I.T hoping he’d go into the 
                        family business.  Stew had other 
                        plans.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           College Championship.  Ivy League death-match for $100,000. 

           Stew in an MIT sweatshirt, killing it.  Rapid series of cuts:

           FREEZE on Stew, blowing a kiss at the YALE GIRL on his left.  

                                 BEN
                        Two weeks later he lost it all in 
                        one of those Nigerian Craigslist 
                        scams.  Broke his little heart. 

           EXT. TOKYO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           The rental pulls up outside the DEPARTURES TERMINAL.

                                 STEW
                        I’m just sick of this travel agent 
                        bullshit.  Put in a good word for 
                        me with Coop, then next gig we go 
                        out together Double Dragon style.

           Stew throws out some improvised kung fu as his Bluetooth 
           starts flashing.  He clicks over to answer:
                                 STEW (INTO BLUETOOTH) (CONT’D)
                        Scrub-A-Rug.  Oh, hey Claire.  Hold 
                        on one sec, pretty sure Roy’s out 
                        on a sales call...

           Stew covers the Bluetooth, whispering to Ben.

                                 STEW (CONT’D)
                        Popping a Sudanese tribal leader.

           But Ben's only half-listening.  He pulls an envelope from the 
           glove box.  Passport, driver’s license, plane ticket.

                                 BEN
                        Hey, weird.  You’ve got me flying 
                        into Chicago.  Here I was thinking 
                        I still live in LA. 

                                 STEW
                        Dude, it’s Thanksgiving.
                             (back to Claire)
                        Claire-bear, I couldn’t get him.  
                        Okay, dinner with your folks, eight 
                        PM, not Chardonnay.  Got it.  I’ll 
                        make sure Roy gets the message.  
                        Give little Tommy a hug for me.
                             (hangs up)
                        God damn that woman is sexy.

           Ben's still focused on the plane ticket.   

                                 BEN
                        Where’s my ticket?

                                 STEW
                        Pilgrims.  Stuffing.  Turkey tikka 
                        masala.  Any of this ring a bell? 

                                 BEN
                        Yeah thanks, but no thanks.  

                                 STEW
                        Ben, you gotta go home sooner or 
                        later.  Or your moms will just keep 
                        calling and I can’t take that shit.  
                             (off Ben's look)
                        You’re not the one that’s gotta 
                        always be lying to her, man.  That 
                        lady is intense.  
                             (beat)
                        When’s the last time you were home? 
                                 BEN
                        I don’t know.  Couple of years 
                        maybe.  My Bar Mitzvah?    

                                 STEW
                        Dude.  That’s fucked up.  My dad 
                        hasn’t said my name in over six 
                        years, just calls me “The Sadness”, 
                        and I still do my turkey time.

                                 BEN
                        Thanks for the heart to heart.   
                        Now get me on a plane to L.A.  

                                 STEW
                        Do I look like Indian Jesus?  
                        Thanksgiving is Thursday.  You 
                        wanna get to L.A., you’re gonna 
                        have to Forrest Gump your ass cause 
                        every train, plane and car’s been 
                        booked since July.  

                                 BEN
                        You already told her I was coming.

                                 STEW
                        You’ve got a layover in London.  
                        You want to complain.  Take it up 
                        with the big man.  He calls the 
                        shots.  I just work here homey.    

           INT. HEATHROW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Chic, dimly lit.  Some DRUNKEN BUSINESSMEN laugh at a table.

           Perched at the end of the bar, Ben draws on a napkin.

           There’s something different about him.  Like a superhero 
           without the costume.  Off-duty and very much alone.   

           TIGHT ON: Ben's napkin.  Surrounded by sharks, a little man 
           clings to a tiny raft in the middle of a troubled ocean.  

           A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN slides onto the stool next to Ben.  She 
           gives him a once over.  Eh, maybe he’ll do.  

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        I’m Vivian.

                        Oh, hi, um, Ben.  
                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                             (seductively)
                        And what do you do, Ben?  

                                 BEN
                        I sell carpet cleaning equipment.  

           The end.  She heads for the drunken businessmen.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Right.  Have a good day.  

           COOP, 50, Hawaiian shirt, panama hat and a stogie takes her 
           seat.  Caramel tan says this guy lives his life on vacation.  

                                 COOP
                        You know, you’re allowed to have a 
                        little fun every now and then.  

                                 BEN
                        I have fun.  Work is fun.  

           Coop’s eyes take a stroll up Vivian’s legs.

                                 COOP
                        Not like that it’s not.  

           He flags down the BARTENDER.

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        Macallan 21.  Neat.  And send 
                        something fruity over to the lady.  
                             (back to Ben)
                        Using the son was clever.  How’d 
                        you get to him?  

                                 BEN
                        Bodyguard had a peanut allergy.  
                        Made an extract, spiked his meal.  

                                 COOP
                        That’s my boy.  Hey Bob, do I know 
                        how to pick ‘em or what?  

           Coop’s body man, BOB, sits nearby with an US Weekly. 

                                 BEN
                        This is about the kid, isn’t it?  

                                 COOP
                        Client paid for both of them.  You 
                        going soft on me?       
                                 BEN
                        Coop, the guy’s a joke.     

                                 COOP
                        Maybe.  But he’s got his father’s 
                        contacts and more importantly, his 
                        name, which means--     

                                 BEN
                        He’s got reach.  You think he’s 
                        stupid enough to come after us?  

                                 COOP
                        Maybe.  Maybe not.  

                                 BEN
                        I can fix it.  A week, two tops. 

                                 COOP
                        No dice.  You’ve got talent kid, 
                        but you’re not exactly low profile.  

           Coop drops a paper on the bar.  Shot of Takashi next to: 
           MANHUNT UNDERWAY FOR KILLER OF YAKUZA CRIME LORD.

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        Besides you’re due for a vacation. 
                        Brightest stars burn the fastest, 
                        kid.  Some time with the fam will 
                        do ya good.  

                                 BEN
                        My whole life’s a vacation.

                                 COOP
                        I know.  Ain’t it grand?

           A WAITER delivers the drink to Vivian, nods over to Coop at 
           the bar.  He flashes a smile, throws in a wink.  Done. 

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’ve gotta go make love to 
                        that woman over there but since 
                        you’re the closest thing I’ve got 
                        to a son, I’ll pause for some 
                        fatherly advice: go home while you 
                        still can.  

           As Coop heads for Vivian, Ben adds a caption to his cartoon: 
           “Maybe the island wasn’t so bad after all.” 

           A PLANE ROARS OVERHEAD --
           EXT. O’HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           And touches down in snowy Chicago beneath a cold, gray sky.

           I/E. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The door swings open, revealing IRENE, 50’s, bursting with 
           warmth and energy.  She talks as fast as she moves and she 
           never stops.  A woman desperately in need of Xannax.    

                                 IRENE
                        Oh my God!

                                 BEN
                        Hey Mom.

           Irene pulls Ben into a hug as he steps inside.

                                 IRENE
                        Ben!  David, come out here!

           DAVID, 60’s, ambles out from the kitchen.  Slowly.  The man 
           moves like molasses.  Still, he occasionally flickers with 
           the quiet charm of his more dashing youth.  

                                 DAVID
                        What are you yelling about?  

                                 IRENE
                        Put your glasses on.

           He slips on his glasses, spots Ben and immediately lights up.

                                 DAVID
                        Ben!  Holy... Irene, why didn’t you 
                        tell me Ben was coming?  

                                 IRENE
                        Because I take pleasure in lying to 
                        you.  Stop being an idiot.

           David goes in for a hug too.  

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I can’t believe you made it. 

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, well, job fell through. 

                                 IRENE
                        Oh my God.  You got fired.  David, 
                        he got fired. 
           David immediately pulls out his wallet, counting twenties...  

                                 DAVID
                        Here, how much do you need?

                                 IRENE
                        You were always too good for that 
                        carpet job--

                                 BEN
                        What?  No.  I didn’t get fired.  
                        I’m just, you know... on vacation.

                                 IRENE
                             (disappointed)
                        Oh.  Vacation.  So you’re still 
                        cleaning the carpets?

                                 DAVID
                        Irene.

                                 IRENE
                        What?  It’s great.  Whatever makes 
                        him happy.  Clean the carpets.  
                        Make the carpets.  Sell the 
                        carpets.  It’s all fine by me.  Oh, 
                        you look so good.  David, doesn’t 
                        he look great?  Did you lose 
                        weight?  Are you eating enough?  He 
                        looks too thin, don’t you think? 

                                 DAVID
                        Nah, he looks good.  Husky.

                                 IRENE
                        What are you talking about husky?  

                                 BEN
                        Oh, so I got you guys some gifts. 

                                 IRENE
                        Gifts?  David, he got gifts.  

           Ben hands Irene a LUTHER VADROSS ALBUM, and gives David a 
           NOVELTY LIGHTER.  It looks like a mini bottle of ketchup.

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        Luther Vandross.  I love it!

                                 DAVID
                        Who’s Luther Vandross?
                                 IRENE
                        Who’s Luther Vandross?  He’s a very 
                        talented Afro-American singer.  

           David fumbles with the tiny ketchup lighter. 

                                 BEN
                        Dad, it’s not actually ketchup.

           Ben flips on the lighter.  David’s genuinely blown away.  

                                 DAVID
                        Oh wow.  Will you look at that.

           Ben takes in the house.  It has a warm, liberal, academic 
           feel.  Overflowing with books, art and family photos. 

                                 BEN
                        So.  The place looks... the same.  

                                 IRENE
                        You know your father. 

                                 DAVID
                        As the Romans used to say, change 
                        is overrated.

                                 BEN
                        The Romans said that? 

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, sure, sure.   

           Irene beams up at Ben, smiling.  It’s touching... Then:

                                 IRENE
                        Ben, are you stoned?

                                 DAVID
                        Irene.

                                 IRENE
                        What?  Look at his eyes. 

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Divided down the middle.  On one side: Ben's cartoons and the 
           clutter of a kid who spends his days toking up and jerking 
           off. 

           On the other: an inordinate number of trophies, awards and 
           commendations give off a very Doogie Howser vibe.
           Ben eases onto the edge of the stoner bed.   

           He stares up at the KELLY LEBROCK POSTER on his ceiling. 

                                 BEN
                        What the fuck am I doing?  

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           David lies on the couch, eyes closed, focused on napping as 
           Irene paces, battling the shrink wrap on her new Vandross CD.

                                 IRENE
                        Still in that God-awful carpet job. 
                        No friends.  No girlfriend--

                                 DAVID
                        The kid’s happy.  Leave him alone.

                                 IRENE
                        I think he’s getting into the drugs 
                        again.  Maybe even dealing.  

                                 DAVID
                        Irene.  He’s fine.  Leave him be.  

                                 IRENE
                        Leave him be.  That’s your answer 
                        for everything.  Leave him be.   

                                 DAVID
                        I’m already napping.  You may think 
                        I’m awake, but I’m actually asleep.  
                        So please stop talking to me.  

           The DOORBELL lifts Irene’s mood like a shot of Prozac.  

                                 IRENE
                        Oh, Ollie, thank God.  

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ben's incredibly more handsome, younger brother, OLLIE, 27, 
           is center stage, leading the family in prepping dinner.  

                                 OLLIE
                        So there we are, three days hike 
                        from the nearest hospital and I’ve 
                        got this boy’s heart in my hands, 
                        and I’m pumping it, you know?
           Ollie dramatically sprinkles herbs and whisks sauces like a 
           Food Network star, moving in tandem with Irene, his eager 
           sous chef.  David opens some wine, completely enthralled.

                                 DAVID
                        Ben, can you believe your brother?

           REVEAL: Ben, relegated to potato peeling detail.

                                 BEN
                        Unbelievable.

                                 IRENE
                        Ben, honey, wanna try chopping 
                        those onions?  No thumbs, okay? 

           Ben grabs an onion, FLIPS a KNIFE into his palm.  Badass.  
           But David and Irene are too focused on Ollie to notice.    

                                 OLLIE
                        Anyway, he looks up at me, right 
                        into my eyes and he says: Ahsante.  
                        It’s Swahli for thank you.   

                                 BEN
                        Onions.  No thumbs.  

           Ben hands Irene a mountain of perfectly diced onions.

                                 IRENE
                        Wow, that was fast.  
                             (to Ollie)
                        Looks like somebody’s got some 
                        competition.  

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Finishing up their first family dinner in years.  

                                 OLLIE
                        So, Ben, what’s new and exciting in 
                        the world of carpets?

                                 BEN
                        Oh, you know.  

                                 IRENE
                             (cheerfully)
                        He doesn’t know.  That’s the point.  
                        He’s interested.  We all are.  

                                 BEN
                        I just got back from a trip.
                                 IRENE
                        Oh, my two jet setters.  Where were 
                        you this time honey?  

                                 BEN
                        Buffalo.  

           That’s enough to take the wind out of even Irene’s sails.  

                                 IRENE
                        Oh.  You know your Uncle Leonard 
                        once headlined a production of Lear 
                        at the Buffalo Children’s Theater.

                                 OLLIE
                        Ben, I gotta tell you, I envy you.  
                        I can’t count how many times I’ve 
                        sat out there alone in the bush and 
                        thought about throwing up my hands 
                        and taking that nine to five.  Just 
                        saying “So there’s pain in the 
                        world?  So there’s suffering?  What 
                        difference can I really make?”  But 
                        then I hear the music.

                                 BEN
                        There’s music in the bush?

                                 OLLIE
                        It’s the children’s laughter, Ben.  
                        I hear it and I know I just have to 
                        pick myself up, find that horizon 
                        and move on to the next village. 

           Irene reaches out to Ollie’s hand for support.  She’s crying.

                                 BEN
                        I’ve gotta make a call.  

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Ben huddles just inside the doorway, phone to his ear.  

                                 BEN (ON PHONE)
                        Coop’s gotta have something for me.   

           INTERCUT WITH STEW, at a strip club on his Bluetooth, 
           lotioning the ass of a sizable stripper, CINNAMON.   
                                 STEW (ON PHONE)
                        Sorry bro.  Big man’s gone dark.  
                        Something about closing a deal in 
                        London.  He pick up a client I 
                        don’t know about?

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, her name’s Vivian.  

                                 DAVID
                        Ben.  Take a look at this.  

           David shows off a new gift from Ollie - a HIGH-TECH WATCH. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Water resistent up to three-hundred 
                        meters.

                                 BEN
                        Do a lot of deep-sea diving, dad?

                                 IRENE
                        Never goes in past his ankles.

                                 BEN
                             (back to Stew)
                        Dude.  Get me out of here.

                                 STEW
                        I feel you man.  My dad’s got me 
                        sleeping in the backyard.  Just a 
                        sheet and a flashlight.  Oh shit, 
                        out of lotion.  Gotta jam.

           Stew drops the call as Cinnamon drops her top.

                                 BEN
                        Stew?  Shit.  

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           SEAGULLS CAW over CRASHING WAVES care of a New Age CD.

           Ollie is curled up on his bed, fast asleep.

           Across the room, Ben lays awake, staring up at Kelly.  He 
           checks the clock.  2:42.  Going to be a long night.  

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ben eases downstairs in his tighty-whities, finds David 
           snoring on the couch under a thin blanket.  
           He notices a FRAMED PHOTO: the family back in the day, 
           smiling in front of the station wagon on a summer road trip.

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ben digs through the fridge, closes the door, revealing --

           A JAPANESE THUG wielding a silenced pistol.  Ben dodges the 
           first shot, swings the freezer door into the guy’s face.   

           A SECOND THUG pulls a piano wire around his throat.  As Ben 
           gasps for air, David stumbles in to grab some water.  

                                 BEN
                             (just barely)
                        Dad... Help...

           Completely oblivious, David fills his glass at the sink.  

           The first thug fires, but Ben uses the guy on his back as a 
           human shield.  A stray bullet shatters David’s glass:

                           DAVID
           What the...
                                                           BEN
                                              Dad, get down!  

                                 DAVID
                        Ben?

           David drops behind the counter under a rain of gunfire.

           Ben FORKS the thug in the eye, clocks him with a FRYING PAN -- 

           As a THIRD THUG kicks open the door, silenced machine gun 
           pumping rounds.  Ben takes cover behind the counter next to 
           David.  Gunfire all around them.  Ben's cool as ice.  CLICK. 

                                 BEN
                        I think he’s out.  

           David looks to Ben:  Who the fuck are you?

           The thug reloads.  Ben makes his move.  Takes out the guy’s 
           knee, kicks him into fridge, uses the door to SNAP his neck.

           LIGHTS FLIP ON.  Irene stands in the doorway.  Stunned.  

                                 IRENE
                        Oh my Lord.

           REVEAL Ben in his tighty-whities, sweating over three bodies.

           David rises from behind the counter holding just a spoon.  
                                 DAVID
                        I just wanted a glass of water.  

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Irene follows Ben as he searches through drawers while David 
           covers the bodies with sections of The New York Times.

                                 IRENE
                        Benjamin, there are three dead 
                        Asian men--

                                 DAVID
                        This one’s actually alive I think.  

           The thug Ben forked in the eye sits tied to a chair.

                                 IRENE
                        Fine.  Two dead and one with a fork 
                        where it has no right to be.  Now, 
                        I think we’re entitled to know just 
                        what the hell is going on here.

                                 BEN
                        Okay so for the past ten years I’ve 
                        been working for a kinda private, 
                        non-governmental organization, 
                        specializing in... Conflict 
                        resolution?

                                 DAVID
                        Jesus.

                                 IRENE
                        Oh God, I need a drink.  

           Irene pulls a bottle of wine from the cabinet.  Fills a tall 
           water glass.  To the top.  Downs it.  Refills.  

                                 DAVID
                        What does that mean?  Private?   
                        Like Blackwater?

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, sure.  Something like that.

                                 IRENE
                        My mother was right.  We should 
                        have pushed him to go to college.

                                 DAVID
                        Ben, I want you to be honest with 
                        me.  JFK.  Was that you?
                                 IRENE
                        Don’t be ridiculous, David. 

                                 DAVID
                        An organization, Irene, who knows 
                        how deep this goes.

                                 BEN
                        Listen, we stay away from the 
                        political jobs.  It’s mostly drug 
                        lords, dictators, the occasional 
                        Russian oligarch--   

           The forked thug starts mumbling in Japanese... 

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, look, your friend here’s waking 
                        up.  Seems the old fork to the eye 
                        failed to do the trick, you know, 
                        for future reference.  

                                 IRENE
                        Okay, let’s stop and think about 
                        this.  After all, these men did 
                        break into our home to do God knows 
                        what to our son.  Maybe we should 
                        try being a little more supportive.  

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, sure.  Hell of a job son.   

           Irene notices Ben tearing through more drawers.

                                 IRENE
                        Ben, if you told me what you were 
                        looking for, maybe I could help.  

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know.  A torch.  Meat 
                        shears.  

                                 DAVID
                        What are you going to do with a 
                        torch?  

           An awkward silence and David gets it.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Oh no.  Not in my house.  

                                 IRENE
                        What?  What’s going on?
                                 DAVID
                        Your son wants to turn our kitchen 
                        into Guantanamo Bay, that’s what.

                                 BEN
                        Listen, somehow these guys found me 
                        here and I need to know how.  

                                 DAVID
                        Fine.  Sounds simple enough.

           David squats in front of the thug, who, unnoticed by the 
           family, quietly works on the ropes around his hands.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Hi there, I’m Professor Mandel.  I 
                        think we might be able to avoid 
                        some real unpleasantness here--

           The thug SPITS blood in David’s face. 

                                 IRENE
                        Ben, would a lemon peeler work?  

                                 OLLIE (O.S.)
                        Holy shit.

           Ollie enters in shock.

                                 DAVID
                        Your brother’s a professional 
                        killer.  

           The thug leaps behind Ollie, knife to his throat, shouting in 
           Japanese.  

           As Ollie panics, Ben feels around for a weapon and starts to 
           negotiate.  In fluent Japanese.  David and Irene are stunned.

                                                          OLLIE
                     BEN (IN JAPANESE)
           Easy my friend.  You were not 
           sent here for him.  Surely 
           there is no honor in killing 
           such a sad, little man.  
           Listen to him whimper.
                                              Why is he yelling?  Am I 
                                              dreaming?  There’s a man in 
                                              our refrigerator.  Oh God, 
                                              I’m not ready to die.  I have 
                                              so much left to give.

           The thug digs the blade into Ollie’s neck.  

                                 OLLIE
                        It’s piercing my skin!  The knife 
                        is piercing my skin!

           Ben LAUNCHES A MEAT THERMOMETER into the thug’s head.
                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is going on?!  

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

           Ben herds the family, all in underwear and pj’s, to a station 
           wagon covered in decades’ of liberal bumper stickers.     

           Ollie’s still in shock, ambling in circles and mumbling:  

                                 OLLIE
                        Why would he try to kill me?  I’m a 
                        good person.  Couldn’t he see that? 

           Ben uses kid gloves.  

                                 BEN
                        Okay, in the car.  There we go.  

           David, clutching a bag of pill bottles, heads back inside.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Dad, where you going?

                                 DAVID
                        Forgot my Lipator.   

                                 BEN
                        Fuck the Lipator.  Get in the car.  

                                 DAVID
                        Oh so now he wants to kill me too.   

                                 IRENE
                        David, stop being dramatic.  We’ll 
                        just pick up another bottle.  

                                 DAVID
                        Our son harpooned a man with a meat 
                        thermometer and I’m being dramatic?

                                 IRENE
                        Yes.  Now get in the car.  

           EXT. 7-11 - NIGHT

           Ben uses a pay-phone while the family waits in the car. 

                                 BEN
                        Dude, these guys were pros.  
           INTERCUT WITH STEW whispering on his Bluetooth, spooning in 
           Cinnamon’s bed.  Stew’s naturally the little spoon.  

                                 STEW
                        You thinking blowback from Tokyo?

                                 BEN
                        What else?  

           Irene wanders over with a HAT on her way to the bathroom.

                                 IRENE
                        Honey, it’s freezing, put this on.  

                                 BEN
                        Great, thanks.  I’m on the phone.

           She mouths an apology, carefully tip-toes away.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I need a safe place to 
                        stash my family while I sort this 
                        out.  Another hour together and 
                        I’ll kill them myself. 

                                 STEW
                        No problem.  You got a car? 

           I/E. STATION WAGON - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Back on the road.  Ben’s just broken the news.      

                                 IRENE
                        You want us to lay low in Ohio? 

                                 BEN
                        My buddy knows a guy who’s got a 
                        house out there nobody uses.  

                                 DAVID
                        Okay now enough is enough.  I’m not 
                        driving to Ohio in the middle of 
                        the night in my underwear.  

                                 OLLIE
                        Why don’t we just go to the police?

                                 DAVID
                        Thatta boy.  Excellent idea.  

                                 BEN
                        Sure, if you want me booked for  
                        triple homicide, that’s a home run.  
                                 IRENE
                        Oh my God.  What about Leonard?

                                 BEN
                        Mom--

                                 IRENE
                        We can’t just leave him.  Quick, 
                        turn back. 

                                 DAVID
                        We don’t have time to get my 
                        Lipator,  but we have time to pick 
                        up your psychotic brother.

                                 IRENE
                        You’re one to talk.  Thirty years 
                        as a Democrat and your brother 
                        votes for Bush.  Twice. 

                                 BEN
                        Mom, Leonard will be fine.

                                 IRENE
                        Benjamin, those men knew where we 
                        lived which means they could know 
                        about Leonard and they could try to 
                        use him to get to you.  

                                 OLLIE
                        That actually makes sense.

                                 IRENE
                        Listen to me.  We’re his family, 
                        we’re all he has and we’re not 
                        going to leave him behind to die 
                        like some kind of road animal.  Now 
                        turn this car around.   

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The station wagon makes a bumpy U-turn over the grass median.  

           I/E. STATION WAGON - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Ben shuts off the headlights as they pull onto a quiet 
           suburban street, stopping by a cul-de-sac.  

                                 BEN
                        Stay here.  Don’t touch anything.  
                        Don’t say anything.  Just be still.  
                        And silent.      
                                 IRENE
                        Ollie, go with your brother.

                                 BEN
                        Okay, what did I just say?

                                 IRENE
                        Your uncle’s still recovering from 
                        that broken hip and your brother’s 
                        a doctor.  Besides, you boys should 
                        spend more time together.

           Ben doesn’t have time to argue.  

                                 BEN
                        Fine, but if things get ugly, I 
                        can’t promise he makes it back 
                        alive.  

           Ben hustles out of the car, leaving Ollie too scared to move.

                                 IRENE
                        Oh he’s just teasing, go on.  

           INT. LEONARD’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ollie follows Ben through a window.  The air reeks of death 
           as they make their way across the CREAKING wood floor.

                                 OLLIE
                        This place smells like an ashtray.

                                 BEN 
                        Go that way, I’ll check down here.

           Ben disappears through the SWINGING DOORS to the kitchen.  

           LIVING ROOM

           Ollie wanders in and gets quickly distracted by a  

           WALL OF FRAMED THEATER MEMORABILIA

           REVIEWS, PHOTOS and PLAYBILLS track the thirty-year decline 
           of UNCLE LEONARD from Broadway extra to dinner theater extra.  

                                 MAURICE (O.S.)
                        Aw, hell no!

           MAURICE, 35, African-American, explodes from the darkness 
           SWINGING A BASEBALL BAT in his wife-beater and slippers.

           Ollie ducks for his life, SHRIEKING as they --
           CRASH through furniture, bouncing off walls as Maurice takes 
           out pictures, bookcases, hanging dishes --  

                                 OLLIE
                        Wrong house!  Wrong house!

           Ollie races for the kitchen door... WHAM!  It FLIES into his 
           nose as Ben barrels in from the other side...

           Ollie stumbles back right into... WHAM!  Maurice’s bat 
           connects with his face and drops him cold.  

           Ben TACKLES Maurice over the couch, grabs the bat when --

           CHUG-CHUG. Shotgun PUMP freezes every nerve in Ben's body.  

           REVEAL: UNCLE LEONARD, 73 years of bitterness and resentment, 
           at the base of the stairs, SHOTGUN in hand.  (Think Charles 
           Grodin but without the warmth or charm.)

                                 BEN
                        Uncle Leonard.  It’s okay, I got 
                        him.

                                 LEONARD
                        Morris, call the police.  Tell them 
                        we’ve shot a trespasser.  

                                 BEN
                        Trespasser?

           Maurice grabs the bat, limps to Leonard.

                                 MAURICE
                        Gran Torino motherfucker, why 
                        didn’t you tell me we had a gun?  
                        And how many times I got to tell 
                        you my name is Maurice.  

                                 BEN
                        Wait, Uncle Leonard, it’s me.  Ben.  
                        Your nephew. 

           It doesn’t register.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Irene’s son?

           Leonard stares at him for a beat.  Then lowers the gun.  

                                 LEONARD
                        You got shorter.
           INT. LEONARD’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           David sets Ollie - barely conscious, face swollen - on the 
           couch while Irene rushes around, packing for Leonard. 

                                 IRENE
                        Just think of it like, I don’t 
                        know... a family vacation.  

                                 LEONARD
                        Family vacation’s an oxymoron.  

                                 DAVID
                        I’m with Leonard on this one. 

           Leonard lights up a Lucky Strike, blows some smoke at David:

                                 LEONARD
                        I never cared for you much.

           INT. LEONARD’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME

           PILLS of every conceivable size and color are laid out on the 
           table as Maurice walks Ben through Leonard’s medication.

                                 MAURICE
                        Now at lunch you’ll want to give 
                        him five more of the Amlodipine, 
                        but skip the Digoxin and Crestor.  
                        Wait two hours for his food to 
                        digest, unless it’s soup, then you 
                        drop a little Coumadin on his ass. 

           Maurice pulls out MORE BOTTLES.  Ben’s getting dizzy.

                                 MAURICE (CONT’D)
                        Now this here’s an anal 
                        suppository.

                                 BEN
                        Fuck it.  You’re coming with us. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Son, I don’t work holidays.

                                 BEN
                        C’mon man, you’re his nurse.

                                 MAURICE
                        I’m a home health-care 
                        professional.  Operative word being 
                        home.  As in home.
                                 BEN
                        I’ll give you five thousand 
                        dollars.  Cash.

                                 MAURICE
                        I got time to pack? 

           EXT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - DAWN

           A full-blown crime scene.  Squad cars and ambulances block a 
           street filled with stunned NEIGHBORS in bathrobes. 

           A helicopter lands on the lawn, where baby-faced AGENT 
           PATTERSON, 32, hugs an arm-full of files.  AGENT KAREN WHITE, 
           40’s, all business, hops off the chopper.   

                                 PATTERSON
                        Morning, ma’am.

                                 WHITE
                        Want to tell me what we’re doing in 
                        Illinois?

           Patterson follows White into --

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The place is swarming with LAW ENFORCEMENT of every kind.  
           Patterson passes White files on the Mandels:

                                 PATTERSON
                        Husband teaches classics at 
                        Chicago, wife’s a college counselor 
                        at the local high school. 

                                 WHITE
                        Kids?  

                                 PATTERSON
                        Oldest is Benjamin, twenty-nine, 
                        sells carpet cleaning equipment, 
                        based out of Los Angeles.  

           White glances at Ben's odd-looking photo.  He looks like a 
           stoned chimp.  She moves on without a second thought:

                                 WHITE
                        Oldest?  
                                 PATTERSON
                        Younger one, Oliver, is a physician 
                        with Doctors Without Borders.  
                        Currently stationed in... Numibia.  

           This catches White’s interest.  She examines Ollie’s file.  

                                 WHITE
                        Doctors Without Borders.  
                        International.  Interesting.
                        I want this black-bagged.  You’ll 
                        need to liaise with NSA, FBI.  Keep 
                        them off our turf.  Kitchen secure?  

           White strides to the kitchen where she finds --

           INT. DAVID AND IRENE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN

           FRANK DRYER, 56, jeans and a worn jacket, fixing himself a 
           sandwich.  Doesn’t seem to mind the three bodies at his feet.  

                                 DRYER
                        Sorry fellas, area’s off limits... 
                             (spotting White)
                        Oh, Karen, good to see you.  Mind 
                        passing me that OJ?   

                                 WHITE
                        Dryer?  

           Dryer licks some mayo off his thumb, shakes Patterson’s hand.

                                 DRYER
                        Frank Dryer, mid-west Ops.

                                 WHITE
                        Frank’s been on the Agency’s 
                        coveted rustbelt desk, chasing down 
                        Canadian car thieves for, what is 
                        it, eight years now?

                                 DRYER
                        Nine actually.  Ever since Karachi.  

           Dryer gleefully watches White’s smile tighten.

                                 DRYER (CONT’D)
                        You remember Karachi, don’t ya 
                        Karen?  

           Dryer takes a massive bite of his sandwich, smiles.  No doubt 
           about it.  Something definitely went down between these two.
                                 WHITE
                        This is my case, Dryer.  My task 
                        force has full--

                                 DRYER
                        Jurisdiction over any and all 
                        investigations involving criminal 
                        activity by Takashi Ajito.  Hey, 
                        wait, that’s not the same Takashi 
                        Ajito who got popped last week in 
                        Tokyo?  You don’t think this could 
                        be related, do ya?    

           ON DRYER, mischief flashing behind his eyes.  

                                 WHITE
                        Okay, I’ve got it.  This is your 
                        backyard.  You want to observe, 
                        fine.  But stay out of my way.  

                                 DRYER
                        Absolutely.  Hey, you wanna bite of 
                        this?  Best tuna salad of my life.

           White turns to Patterson, no time for Dryer’s shit. 

                                 WHITE
                        I want to know everything there is 
                        to know about Oliver Mandel.  

           EXT. IOWA SAFE HOUSE - MORNING

           The station wagon follows a gravelly path to a beautiful old 
           FARMHOUSE.  Fields of corn stretch to the horizon.  

           I/E. STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           They pull up in front of the house.  

                                 IRENE
                        What a lovely safe house.  

                                 MAURICE
                        Field of Dreams and shit.  

                                 BEN
                        Okay, so, probably best if you guys 
                        wait here while I sweep the house--

           But Maurice is already out of the car and heading inside.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Yo dude, hold up...

           Maurice spins around, gets in Ben's face.  

                                 MAURICE
                        I been pinching my dick for an 
                        hour.  You want me to piss in your 
                        backseat or can I relieve myself in 
                        this house like a grown ass man?

           Ben glances around.  The farm is quiet and still.  Safe. 

                                 BEN
                        Fine just be fast.  And don’t touch 
                        anything.  

                                 MAURICE
                        Whateva you say.  Masta.

           The family climbs out of the wagon.  Except for Leonard, who 
           stays in the back-back and lights up another cigarette.  

                                 IRENE
                        Leonard, you don’t want to get out?

                                 LEONARD
                        What for?  The tics or the cowshit?

           David begins a bizarre stretching ritual.  Ollie’s working 
           him like some kind of New Age Lamaze coach.  

                                 OLLIE
                        Focus on extending.  Now breathe.  
                        Inhale, inhale, inhale and exhale.

                                 BEN
                        So when are you two expecting? 

                                 OLLIE
                        Dad, why don’t you take your meds 
                        before we get into the Kegels.
                             (sharply, to Ben)
                        It’s yoga.  For his back.  

                                 BEN
                        Since when do you have a bad back?

           David returns from the car with a palm-full of pills.

                                 DAVID
                        Hit me out of the blue when your 
                        mother filed for the divorce.    
           Ben and Ollie freeze.  What did he just say?  

           Maurice opens the front door.  BEEP.  BEEP.  BEEP.

                                 MAURICE
                        Yo, you got the code for the--

           BOOM!  THE ENTIRE FARMHOUSE EXPLODES INTO A GIANT FIREBALL.   
           Shattered glass and burning wood scatter everywhere.

           The family climb to their feet, covered in soot and ash.  

                                 BEN
                        Everyone alright?  

                                 OLLIE
                        Divorced?  You’re getting divorced?

                                 IRENE
                        You didn’t! 

                                 DAVID
                        It slipped out.  

                                 BEN
                        Right, and then the farmhouse 
                        exploded, so--

                                 OLLIE
                        Is it the sex?  Did you even try 
                        the intimacy techniques I 
                        suggested? 

                                 BEN
                        Amazing you’re still single.  Get 
                        in the car.     

                                 IRENE
                        Ollie, Ben, this isn’t your fault. 
                        Do you hear me?  

                                 BEN
                        Why would it be my fault?

                                 IRENE
                        It’s no one’s fault.  No one’s.  
                             (beat)
                        Except maybe your father’s.

           Leonard ambles over from the back-back, completely oblivious. 

                                 LEONARD
                        Where’s Morris?
           A second blast form the house.  Like a burp after a big meal.  

           EXT. RAILROAD CROSSING - MORNING

           The battered station wagon rolls to a stop.  Silence.  
           Suddenly, a freight train rockets across the tracks.    

           I/E. STATION WAGON - MORNING

           The family sits in shock, staring at the passing train cars.  

           Ollie pulls out his blackberry, starts to dial.

                                 BEN
                        What are you doing?

                                 OLLIE
                        Calling an ambulance.  That nurse 
                        may still be alive--

           Ben grabs the blackberry, tossing it into the brush.  
           Horrified, Ollie looks to his parents for back-up:

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Did you see that?  

           EXT. ROADSIDE - SAME

           Ollie rushes after his phone as Ben and the family follow.    

                                 BEN
                        Think it’s a little late for CPR. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Oh, so now you’re a doctor!  

                                 DAVID
                        Boys--

                                 BEN
                        No, you’re right.  They’ll just get 
                        his head from the porch and his 
                        lungs from the driveway and do some 
                        mouth to mouth.  

                                 IRENE
                        Your brother’s only trying to help.

                                 BEN
                        We saw the man explode.  He 
                        exploded.  End of discussion.  
           Ollie pops up from the brush, blackberry in hand.  

                                 OLLIE
                        Found it!  Great.  No service.  

                                 IRENE
                        I just don’t understand how this 
                        happened.  

                                 LEONARD
                        You let the half-wit here do the 
                        planning, that’s how.  

                                 IRENE
                        I thought you said that house was 
                        supposed to be safe.  

                                 BEN
                        It was.  Somebody must have...

           Ben stops himself, starting to put it all together. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Son of a bitch.  

           David’s already a few steps ahead.

                                 DAVID
                        This is what the Greeks called an 
                        epiphany.

                                 BEN
                        He set me up.  Stew set me up.  

                                 DAVID

                        psullown anastaysei.

           The family stares at him, dumbfounded.  He translates:

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Lay down with dogs, son, you rise 
                        with fleas.  Sophocles.  

                                 IRENE
                        See what I’m dealing with?  

           EXT. OHIO SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           ASIAN THUGS sort through what’s left of the farmhouse.  

                                 ASIAN THUG (IN JAPANESE)
                        Boss!
           Sonny - Vin’s bodyguard from the plane - wades into the 
           wreckage.  A scar on his throat marks his run-in with Ben.  

                                 ASIAN THUG (CONT’D)
                        He’s not here.  But we found this.

           The thug hands Sonny DAVID’S PILL BOTTLE.  

                                 ASIAN THUG (CONT’D)
                        Tracks head East.

                        Get the car.  

           EXT. SMALL TOWN PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Grocery bags in hand, Ollie and David return to the station 
           wagon as Ben hustles out of the library, a man with a plan.    

           The smooth sounds of Luther Vandross echo from the car.    

                                 IRENE
                        Ben, do you hear what I’m playing? 
                        Isn’t it great?

                                 BEN
                        Great, mom.  Ollie, got the phones?

           Ollie opens his bag - a couple dozen DISPOSABLE CELL PHONES.

                                 OLLIE
                        So where’s the next crime scene?

                                 BEN
                        Cute.  Look, we call Coop, pay a 
                        quick visit to Stew and then get 
                        you guys to New York by Thursday.

                             (singing)
                        Start spreading the news.  I’m 
                        leaving today...

           Leonard continues belting out New York, New York over:

                                 IRENE
                        Ben, honey, what’s in New York?

                                 BEN

                        We need to get  you guys out of the 
                        country, but airports aren’t an 
                        option.  Luckily port security’s a 
                        joke so getting--

                                 DAVID
                        Wait.  Setting sail for where 
                        exactly?  

                                 BEN
                        Oh, right.  Azerbaijan.  

           It sits there for a moment.  Like a dead elephant.  

                                 DAVID
                        Well honey, looks like you get that 
                        second honeymoon after all

                                 IRENE
                        But Ben, Thursday’s Thanksgiving.  

                                 DAVID
                        Priorities, Irene.

                                 BEN
                        You spend six, seven days below 
                        deck, just until you reach the 
                        Caspian.  Bribe a local to get you 
                        into Baku.  From there it’s just a 
                        few days drive to Grozny.  

                                 OLLIE
                        Grozny?  As in...  

                                 BEN
                        Chechnya. 

           All color drains from Ollie’s horrified face.

                        There’s a distillery about twelve 
                        kilometers North of the city.  
                        Floor manager’s named Yuri 
                        Kalatozov, old school, ex-KGB, owes 
                        me a favor.  I’ll call as soon as-- 

                                 IRENE
                        Call?  You’re not coming with us?  

                                 OLLIE
                        Of course not.  He’s got places to 
                        be, people to kill.

                        Oh, God forbid we do anything 
                        spontaneous.

                                 DAVID
                        Dinner without a reservation is 
                        spontaneous.  Azerbaijan, Irene, is 
                        not spontaneous!

                                 OLLIE
                        Guys, what did we say about 
                        channelling our hostility?  

                                 IRENE
                        I’ll channel it right up his--

           Ben slams the car HORN, shocking everyone into silence.  

                                 BEN
                        Enough!  Maybe you’ve already 
                        forgotten about the three dead 
                        ninjas in your kitchen or Leonard’s 
                        barbecued nurse but there are some 
                        real serious motherfuckers out 
                        there.  Which means, I’m in charge, 
                        I make the decisions and I say 
                        Thursday morning the four of you 
                        are getting on that boat.  End of 
                        story.  Period.  Goodbye.    

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           The station wagon speeds by as a CELL PHONE flies out the 
           window and shatters against the blacktop.

           I/E. STATION WAGON - MOVING - DAWN

           In the backseat, Ben pulls a new phone from the bag, dials.

                                 BEN
                             (on the phone, in Italian)
                        Marco, it’s Ben.  Coop happen to be 
                        staying at the hotel?  No?  Thanks. 

           Ben tosses the PHONE, pulls out another, dials.
                                 OLLIE
                        Killing people, killing the planet.  
                        What’s the difference.

           Leonard’s using a jacket as a blanket, trying to nap.

                                 LEONARD
                        You girls ever shut up?

                                 BEN
                             (on the phone, in German)
                        Klaus, it’s Ben.  Good, my friend.  
                        I’m looking for Coop...

           They pass another sign: LAST EXIT FOR 20 MILES.  

           David glances at the gas gauge.  They’re running close to 
           empty.  He can feel Irene leaning over, eyeing the gas.

                                 DAVID
                        Irene, you’re hovering.  

                                 IRENE
                        Did you see the sign?

                                 DAVID
                        I saw the sign.

                                 IRENE
                        But you’re not stopping are you?

                                 DAVID
                        Do you know why they put those 
                        signs there?  

                                 IRENE
                        Here we go.  No, David, why do--

                                 DAVID
                        To scare you into stopping at some 
                        podunk gas station and paying four 
                        dollars a gallon, that’s why.  It’s 
                        terrorism.  Plain and simple.  And 
                        I for one am not going to be 
                        intimidated into paying fifty 
                        dollars to fill up my tank.

           Ben finishes a call, this time in Farsi, dumps the phone.  

                                 BEN
                        Dad, I’ll pay for the gas.  
                                 DAVID
                        It’s not the money.  It’s the 
                        principle.  I’ve driven this car 
                        for twenty-three years.  And I’m 
                        telling you, we’ll be fine for 
                        another forty miles, at least. 

           EXT. ROADSIDE - SHOULDER - DAY

           The station wagon sits on the shoulder like a beached whale.  
           Out of gas.  Emergency blinkers flash as TRAFFIC speeds past.  

           Ben's still on the phone as they trek to civilization.  

                                 DAVID
                        Listen, we can waste the next hour 
                        arguing over who’s to blame--

                                 IRENE
                        Who’s to blame?  The man is 
                        unbelievable.  Who’s to blame? 
                        You’re to blame, David.  You are!    

                                 BEN
                        Amazing you guys weren’t able to 
                        work it out.  
                             (in French, into phone)
                        Hello, Philipe?  How’s the market? 

           EXT. FRENCH RIVIERA FARMER’S MARKET - DUSK

           The Mediterranean glistens behind Coop as he strolls through 
           a bustling farmer’s market, sampling local delicacies.  

           Bob trails Coop with a hand-basket for groceries. 

           PHILIPE, a portly French baker, runs a phone to Coop.    

                                 PHILIPE
                             (in French)
                        Sir, it’s Ben.

                                 COOP
                             (into phone)
                        Benny boy, how’s the vacation? 

           INTERCUT WITH BEN AND THE FAMILY WALKING THE HIGHWAY

           ON David and Irene, trekking and eavesdropping.

                                 DAVID
                        What kind of name is that?  Coop?   
           Nearing a sign: WALMART 7 MILES.  Ollie hustles up to David.

                                 OLLIE
                        Hey dad, what do you say we phone 
                        in a prescription for that Lipator.

                                 DAVID
                        Sure, great.  Makes me think of 
                        chicken.  Coop.

           Ollie pulls out his phone, starts to dial.

           BACK WITH BEN AND COOP

                                 COOP
                        Stew?  You sure?

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, I’m sure.  Who was the client 
                        on the Tokyo job? 

                                 COOP
                        Competitor looking to muscle in on 
                        the old man’s territory.  Why?    

                                 BEN
                        If Vin came after me, chances are 
                        whoever hired us for Tokyo is next.   

                                 COOP
                        Okay, I’ll handle the client.  What 
                        about you?  Got a plan?

                                 BEN
                        Thought I’d look up an old friend.

                                 COOP
                        Give Stew my best.  Call me here 
                        tomorrow.  Same time.  And kid.  
                        Watch your back.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah.  You too.  

           Coop hangs up, mood darkened.  Turns to Bob:

                                 COOP
                        Better get the car.  

           EXT. FRENCH RIVIERA FARMER’S MARKET ENTRANCE - DUSK

           A DARK SEDAN, windows tinted, rolls up and Coop gets in.
           INT. DARK SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           The doors LOCK.  Coop looks to the driver.  One of VIN’S 
           THUGS, silenced pistol aimed straight at Coop’s chest. 

                                 VIN (O.S.)
                        Let’s take a drive.

           REVEAL: Vin in the backseat.

           EXT. FRENCH RIVIERA FARMER’S MARKET - DAY

           The Sedan takes off.  Seconds later an IDENTICAL SEDAN rolls 
           up.  Bob emerges, scanning for Coop, but he’s too late.  

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Freezing and exhausted, the family stumbles to the station. 

           As Ben goes for gas, Ollie spots the WALMART.

                                 OLLIE
                        Hey, how bout we grab some clothes 
                        while you fill us up?  

           Ben looks to the Walmart across the street, judging the risk.   

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon.  We look like mental 
                        patients.

                                 LEONARD
                        I don’t think clothes will help.  

           Ben looks around.  Notices other CUSTOMERS staring at the rag-
           tag group.  Ollie’s got a point.  He hands them some cash.   

                                 BEN
                        Fine.  Just stay under the radar.

           INT. WALMART - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY

           Ben enters with his GAS CAN and ducks into the MEN’S ROOM.

           INT. WALMART - MEN’S ROOM - DAY

           In a stall, Ben's peeing, savoring the alone time...   
                                 PHARMACIST (O.S.)
                        Dr. Mandel.  Dr. David Mandel.  
                        Please report to the pharmacy for 
                        your prescription.  

                                 BEN
                        Why not just shoot up a flare?

           Ben finishes up.  Grabs the gas can and opens the stall door 
           on 300 pounds of rage.  SONNY.   

           Ben whacks Sonny with the gas can, spots a MOP AND BUCKET --

           Grabs the mop, flips the bucket.  Soapy water spills across 
           the floor.  Ben swings the mop as Sonny slips around the 
           floor, struggling to stay on his feet...  

           Sonny CHARGES.  Lifts Ben over his head.  SLAMMING HIM into 
           an overhead fluorescent.  SPARKS FLY.  Tosses him into  

           THE STALL

           Drowning Ben in the toilet bowl...

           Ben grabs the porcelain toilet tank cover and HAMMERS it 
           across Sonny’s head.  THUMP.  Lights out for Sonny.  

           INT. WALMART - PHARMACY - DAY

           A THUG strides down an aisle, heading right for --

           DAVID, LEONARD AND OLLIE - signing for pills at the pharmacy, 
           no idea they’re seconds from death when --

           The THUG is YANKED around the corner.  THUMP.  Out pops Ben 
           in his place.  He rushes to the counter: 

                                 DAVID
                        Forty-two dollars.  Can you believe 
                        that?  That’s with the co-pay.  

                                 BEN
                             (to Ollie)
                        You’re writing prescriptions?    

           Ollie hands Leonard some pills.  

                                 OLLIE
                        These should help with the gas. 
                             (to Ben)
                        I’m a doctor, Ben.  I took an oath.      
                                 BEN
                        Yeah well your oath just tried to 
                        drown me in a toilet. 

           INT. WALMART - AISLES - DAY

           Ben rushes David, Ollie and Leonard across the store...

           Spots Irene chatting with ANDIE, 20’s, five feet two inches 
           of Midwestern charm.  

                                 BEN
                        Wait here.  Together.  

           He makes his way down the aisle to Irene and Andie.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Hi, sorry to interrupt.  Mom, we 
                        gotta go.  

                                 IRENE
                        Ben, honey, I want you to meet 
                        somebody.  This is Andie, one of my 
                        old students from Henley.  Class of 
                        ‘99, early admission to Wesleyan.

                                 ANDIE
                        Yeah well thanks to you.  Your mom 
                        drove to Connecticut to do the 
                        recommendation in person.

                                 IRENE
                        Andie’s a wedding planner now, 
                        recently single, moving to Boston.  
                        Isn’t that great! 

                                 ANDIE
                        Your mom told me about your car 
                        trouble.  I’ve got a van if--

                                 BEN
                        You know, I actually got her up and 
                        running but it was nice meeting 
                        you.  Happy Thanksgiving.

           Ben rushes Irene down the aisle.

                                 IRENE
                        Lovely seeing you again! 

                                 BEN
                        What part of under the radar don’t 
                        you understand?
                                 IRENE
                        She started talking to me, 
                        Benjamin.  What was I supposed to 
                        do?  Be rude?

           Ben grabs a can of tennis balls off a shelf, pockets a ball.  

                                 DAVID
                        I saw you steal that ball. 

           EXT. WALMART - PARKING LOT - DAY

           MOVING WITH BEN AND THE FAMILY through rows of PARKED CARS...

           Ben pulls the cigarette from Leonard’s mouth and uses it to 
           burn a hole in the tennis ball.  Then he takes a drag, 
           scanning the lot for a car.  

           Irene plucks the cigarette from his mouth, flicks it away.  

                                 IRENE
                        Sue me.  

           Ben moves to an SUV, presses the hole in the ball against the 
           lock.  Leans into it and the air pressure POPS the lock. 

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        David, did you see that?  He used 
                        the ball to pop the lock.  Isn’t 
                        that just terrific?  

           Ben slides into the driver’s seat, starts hot-wiring the car.

                                 BEN
                        Everybody in.  Vamanos, Vamanos. 

           Irene leaps in without a second thought.  Ollie and Leonard 
           climb in the back as Ben revs the engine to life.  

           Only problem:  David’s still outside the car.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Dad, c’mon, get in.    

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not getting in a stolen car.

                                 IRENE
                        David, get in the car.  

                                 DAVID
                        I’m drawing a line.  
                                 LEONARD
                        Leave him.  

                                 BEN
                        Don’t think of it as stealing. 
                        We’re just borrowing it. 

                                 IRENE
                        See, David.  We’re borrowing it.  

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Hands where I can see them. 

           David turns to find two POLICE OFFICERS, guns drawn, standing 
           with the car’s OWNER, an obese woman in a muumuu.

           Ben switches back to the guy from the plane -- goofy, stoned, 
           harmless.  He looks around the car, acting confused.

                                 BEN
                        Wait a minute.  This isn’t our car. 

           Not even a beat.  Irene’s right there with him.

                                 IRENE
                        Oh my God.  You’re right.  Same 
                        upholstery and everything.  Isn’t 
                        that something. 

                                 BEN
                        Man, this is embarrassing.  Ollie, 
                        doesn’t this look like our car?

                                 OLLIE
                        Oh... Um... Yeah?  

           Ben climbs out of the car, playing up the slacker/stoner act. 

                                 LEONARD
                        We’re getting out again?  

                                 BEN
                        Bet this kinda thing happens all--

           Ben strikes.  Down go the cops.  Cuffs them together, pockets 
           the guns and hustles the family past the stunned owner. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Happy Thanksgiving. 

           The family bolts across the parking lot.  

           Ben spots Andie pushing a cart to her MINIVAN.     
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Wait here.  

           He darts over to Andie, tries to act casual, flashes a smile.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey there.

           Andie sees the family and lights up.  

           EXT. ANDIE’S MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Frosted, sky-blue, with an orange U-HAUL hitched to the back.

           Everyone helps Andie with her bags.

                                 LEONARD
                        You know who you remind me of?  A 
                        young Natalie Wood.  

                                 ANDIE
                        Me?

                                 LEONARD
                        No one’s ever told you that?  With 
                        those eyes?

           Leonard’s not kidding.  He may hate the world, but if there’s 
           one thing he loves, it’s women. He serenades her:

                                 LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        Maria!  I’ve just met a girl named 
                        Maria/ And suddenly that name...

           Leonard keeps singing in the b.g. throughout the scene. 

                                 ANDIE
                        You sure you guys don’t mind just 
                        leaving your car?  

           David realizes the question was to him.  Forcing a smile:

                                 DAVID
                        It was a rental.  

           Ben spots Sonny and his THUGS searching the lot and starts 
           herding the family into the van.  

                                 ANDIE
                        Well it’ll be nice having some 
                        company.  Guess it’s just lucky 
                        we’re both heading East.  
                                 IRENE
                        Andie, honey, you have no idea. 

           I/E. ANDIE’S MINIVAN - MOVING - DAY

           Andie starts the car and a BRITISH MAN’s voice booms from the 
           stereo.  

                                 BRITISH MAN
                        Catherine Earnshaw, may you not 
                        rest as long as I am living!  You 
                        said I killed you, haunt me, then!  

                                 ANDIE
                        It’s, um, just a book on tape... 

           Andie fumbles for the radio as they pull out of the lot, 
           leaving Sonny and his team frustrated and freezing.   

                                 OLLIE
                        Is that Hugh Grant?

                                 ANDIE
                        Uh... Colin Firth I think.
                             (She shuts it off)
                        There.  Sorry.    

                                 BEN
                        Weird.  Always thought of 
                        Heathcliff as more of the Clive 
                        Owen type.
                             (off Andie’s look)
                        Brooding and um... sexy?   

                                 ANDIE
                        Yeah, totally.  I can’t believe you 
                        like Wuthering Heights.

                                 OLLIE
                        I can’t believe you read a book. 

                                 BEN
                        I read when I fly.   

                                 ANDIE
                        Oh right, yeah, your mom was saying 
                        you work in sales?

                                 IRENE
                        Internationally.

                                 ANDIE
                        Wow, like commodities or software--
                                 OLLIE
                        Carpet cleaning equipment.  He 
                        sells carpet cleaning equipment.  

                                 BEN
                        Just kinda fell into it.

           Beat.  Ben and Andie share an awkward smile in the rearview.

                                 LEONARD
                        I once read for Heathcliff.  They 
                        decided to go in another direction.

           COP CARS speed by in the other direction, SIRENS blaring.

           INT. WALMART - NIGHT

           The task force swarms the store, interviewing witnesses, 
           sealing off 

           THE BATHROOM

           White and Patterson survey the damage.  Broken tiles, 
           shattered glass, like a bomb went off.

                                 PATTERSON
                        What’s a Yakuza hit squad doing 
                        chasing some doctor and his family 
                        across half of Ohio.  Ma’am?

                                 WHITE
                        From the looks of it, Oliver 
                        Mandel’s no ordinary doctor.  

           EXT. WALMART - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           A mini crime scene around the car Ben almost stole.  The two 
           officers he took down sit by an ambulance with Dryer.  

                                 OFFICER #2
                        I’m telling you, it was some 
                        hardcore, Enter the Dragon shit.  

                                 DRYER
                        You sure on this?

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Hundred percent.  That’s the guy 
                        who took us down.

           The officer points to Dryer’s photo of Ben Mandel. 
           EXT. MEXICO CITY - MARKET - NIGHT

           MOVING WITH VIN AND TWO THUGS past the VENDORS, GROCERS and 
           BUTCHERS, down some steps and into --

           THE UNDERGROUND ARENA

           Where a frenzied mob of DRUNKS and CORRUPT COPS gamble away 
           their Pesos on a vicious COCKFIGHT.   

           Vin watches from a BALCONY ABOVE.  Pulls out a PHOTO. 

           TIGHT ON THE PHOTO:  Mexican.  60’s.  Kind face.  Cold eyes.   

           This is EL TIO.  As luck would have it, he’s sitting ringside 
           tonight, flanked by the POLICE CHIEF and ARMED GUARDS.  

           Vin watches El Tio laugh and pass the chief an envelope.  
           Business meets pleasure just as the fight breaks up.  

           EXT. MEXICO CITY - BEHIND THE MARKET - NIGHT

           GUARDS clear the alley as the police chief walks El Tio to 
           his car.  A warm goodbye and El Tio answer his CELL PHONE as 
           he slips into 

           THE BACKSEAT

                                 EL TIO
                        Hola.

                                 VIN  (THROUGH PHONE)
                        Next time don’t send a boy to do a 
                        man’s job.  

                                 EL TIO
                        Who is this?  How did you get--

           BOOM!  The car EXPLODES, the blast ripping through the alley. 

           REVEAL: Vin smiling with satisfaction from across the street.  
           A thug hands him another phone.

                                 THUG
                        Sonny.  He’s got another problem.  

           Vin trades phones and disappears into the crowd.  

           INT. ANDIE’S MINIVAN - DRIVING - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Ben's at the wheel, the family sleeping behind him.   
           He glances at the rearview: Andie’s nestled under a coat. 

                                 IRENE  
                        I think she likes you.  

                                 BEN
                        Jesus.  Do you ever sleep?  

                                 IRENE
                        I’m just saying, it’s not every day 
                        you meet an attractive, available 
                        woman with a 1380 SAT score.   

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, well this one’s also six 
                        inches away so maybe we talk about 
                        this some other time. 

                                 IRENE
                        Ben, do you want to know why I’m 
                        leaving your father?  

           Ben looks to her, realizing she’s not just playing around. 

                                 BEN
                        Um... Not really?

                                 IRENE
                        Because he would be perfectly happy 
                        spending the rest of his time on 
                        this earth reading, sleeping and 
                        occasionally playing a game of 
                        scrabble.  I love him to pieces but 
                        I’m fifty-seven years old and I’m 
                        sick of watching other people live 
                        their lives.  Now are you going to 
                        ask her out or not?  I think you 
                        should.  

           Ben can’t help but smile.  

                                 BEN
                        Tell ya what.  I promise to think 
                        about it if you promise to, you 
                        know, just take a step back.  

                                 IRENE
                        What?  Me?  Of course.  I’ve said 
                        my piece, ball’s in your court.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

           Andie’s minivan rolls down a picturesque, tree-lined block.
                                 IRENE (O.S.)
                        And there’s Ben in one of his 
                        poses.  Isn’t he just adorable?  

           INT. ANDIE’S MINIVAN - DRIVING - MORNING

           TIGHT ON: an old, faded photo of 10-year-old Ben, chubby body 
           bursting from some tight swim trunks. 

           Irene’s showing Andie photos from her wallet.  

           Ben's checking the addresses on the passing houses.  He’s all 
           business.  A professional at work. 

                                 ANDIE
                        Is that you and David?  

                                 IRENE
                        What?  Oh, would you look at that.

           TIGHT ON: 1970’s David and Irene beaming on vacation.  Arms 
           wrapped around each other.  Very much in love.  

           Irene rips the photo and tosses David’s half out the window.

                                 DAVID
                        Subtle, Irene.  Subtle.

                                 BEN
                        Okay, this is it.  

           The van stops near a quaint house.  White picket fence.  
           American flag by the door.  Maybe some overcompensating?  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        This should only take a few 
                        minutes.  Sit tight.  

           Ben's out in a flash, leaving Andie a little confused.

                                 ANDIE
                        Does he always take his work so 
                        seriously? 

           INT. JAYARAMAN FAMILY HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben enters through a sliding door, stepping into a snapshot 
           of 70’s suburbia with a few distinctly Indian touches.

           The TV’s been left on but otherwise the place looks empty.
           He spots a FRAMED FAMILY PHOTO: Stew and his stone-faced 
           PARENTS.  Retro pink and grey backdrop from a mall studio. 

           A floorboard CREAKS behind him.  Ben spins, gun drawn --

           And almost shoots David point-blank in the face.  

                           DAVID
                                                           BEN
           Jesus.
                                              Jesus.

           INT. JAYARAMAN FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben pulls David aside, whispering furiously.

                                 BEN
                        You couldn’t just hold it?

                                 DAVID
                        When you get to be my age, you’ll 
                        understand.

                                 IRENE (O.S.)
                        What are we whispering about?

           They find Irene at their side, eager to be included. 

           LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben furiously rushes Irene and David to the sliding door.  

                                 BEN
                        Next time I’m cuffing you to the 
                        car.

                                 DAVID
                        I tried to tell her --

                                 BEN
                        Both of you!

           Ben stops when he spots a CNN REPORT on the TV:

                                 CNN ANCHOR
                        Known as El Tio, Galvez led Mexico 
                        City’s most ruthless cartel.  
                        Authorities believe his murder may 
                        be in response to the assassination 
                        of Yakuza leader Takashi Ajito 
                        earlier this week. 

           Grainy photos of two familiar faces.  El Tio.  And Takashi.
                                 DAVID
                        Friends of yours?

                                 BEN
                        It’s complicated.

                                 DAVID
                        Sure, sure.  Complicated.  Like a 
                        syndicate.  Or a cabal.  Watergate 
                        was complicated.  

                                 BEN
                        Did you hear that?  

                                 DAVID
                        Iran-Contra?  Complicated.  

           The FRONT DOOR starts to UNLOCK.  Not good.  

                                 BEN
                        Car.  Now!

           David pushes the door.  Nothing.  Casually, tosses up his 
           hands.  No sense of urgency whatsoever.

                                 DAVID
                        Think this might be locked.   

           Front door opening.  Time running out.  Ben hustles them into

           THE BATHROOM 

                                 BEN
                        Stay. 

           Ben bolts into the kitchen just as Stew leads Cinnamon into  

           THE FOYER

                                 CINNAMON
                        I thought you was from Paris.

                                 STEW
                        This is what we in the business 
                        call a “safe house”.  All part of 
                        my cover, baby.  

           THE BATHROOM

           Irene cracks the door to watch Stew send Cinnamon upstairs.

           PSSSSSSSSSS.  Irene turns to find David peeing behind her.  
                                 IRENE
                        Ugh.  At least lift the seat.    

           THE KITCHEN

           Stew dances around, free-styling and gathering erotic 
           supplies: whip cream, honey, cold cuts, Saran Wrap.

                                 STEW
                        Stew’s gonna get his dick wet/Say 
                        what, say hey--

                                 BEN
                        Hey.  

           Stew SCREAMS.  Ben raises his gun and Stew drops everything 
           as his hands go up.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s take a drive.  

                                 STEW
                        Yeah, a drive.  That’s cool.  Thing 
                        is, I only paid for an hour so --

           Ben chambers a round -- 

                                 STEW (CONT’D)
                        But Cinnamon’s a pro, she can warm 
                        herself up, let’s drive.   

           LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben walks Stew to the back door, running into Irene. 

                                 IRENE
                        I couldn’t take it anymore.

                                 STEW
                        Dude, you brought your moms? 

           A FLUSH from the bathroom and David enters, zipping his fly.

                                 IRENE
                        And he wonders why I say the 
                        romance is dead.  

                                 DAVID
                        That’s right, Irene, I’ve urinated 
                        the romance out of our marriage.
                                 STEW
                        Damn, no wonder you never go home.

           Surges with anger, Irene knees Stew in the balls.  

                                 IRENE
                        That’s for my kitchen.  

           EXT. JAYARAMAN FAMILY HOME - DAY

           Ben tosses Stew into the tiny SMART CAR parked in the 
           driveway.  Ollie rushes over from Andie’s van.  

                                 OLLIE
                        What happened?  

                                 DAVID
                        It’s complicated.  

           David and Irene head for the van as Ben pulls Ollie aside. 

                                 BEN
                         Ollie, hang on.  

           Ben pulls out a GLOCK.  Breaks it down, chambers a round.       

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        This is a Glock 22.  You’ve got ten 
                        rounds, nine in the clip, one in 
                        the pipe.  Safety.  On.  Off.  Aim 
                        for the chest.  Point and shoot.  
                             (off Ollie)
                        You okay?  

                                 OLLIE
                        What?  Yeah, sure.  Point and 
                        shoot.  Got it.  What about you?

           Ben hands Ollie a wad of cash.

                                 BEN
                        Go buy Andie some breakfast.  Stew 
                        and I need some time to catch up.

           Ben hops in with Stew as Ollie slides the gun into his 
           waistband.  It falls down his pants.  Not a good start.  

           I/E. SMART CAR - DRIVING - MORNING

           Speeding out of town, Ben checks his watch, uses a burner 
           phone as Stew inspects his groin with Zen-like focus.
                                 STEW
                        Yo, I think your mom popped one of 
                        my nuts.  Shiiiiiiit.

                                 BEN (INTO PHONE)
                             (in French)
                        Philipe, it’s Ben.  I’m looking for  
                        Coop.  

           INTERCUT with Philipe in his bakery.

                                 PHILIPE
                             (in French)
                        Oh, I’m sorry Ben, but Mousier Coop 
                        is dead.

                                 BEN
                        What?  How?

                                 PHILIPE
                        Police found his body on the shore 
                        this morning.  I’m so sorry--

           Ben hangs up, then swerves off the main road and onto

           THE QUARRY BRIDGE

           Frozen still like everything around it, the bridge sits 
           silent, not a soul in sight.  

                                 STEW
                        Ben, I ain’t playin.  They did not 
                        used to look like this--

           Ben cracks him in the face with his gun.

                                 STEW (CONT’D)
                        Dude!  What the fuck!

           Stew tilts his head back like a kid with a nose bleed.  

                                 STEW (CONT’D)
                        I think you broke my nose.

                                 BEN
                        Nah.

           Ben slams Stew’s face into the steering wheel.  CRACK.   

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Now I broke your nose.  Get out of 
                        the car.  
           EXT. QUARRY BRIDGE - DAY

           Stew’s sobbing so hard he can barely speak. 

                                 BEN
                        So what?  Got tired of waiting for 
                        Coop to give you that promotion? 

                                 STEW
                             (through sobs)
                        I... don’t... why... this... 

                                 BEN
                        How do I get to Vin? 

                                 STEW
                        How the fuck should I know?  

           Takes a second but Stew finally catches on.  

                                 STEW (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I get it.  You know what?  Fuck 
                        you, Ben.  I’ve got a motherfucking 
                        PhD.  And not from DeVry, alright?  
                        I went to fucking M.I.T.  Did you 
                        see Good Will Hunting?  M.I. 
                        motherfucking T.  For what?  To 
                        drive you to the airport?  Print up 
                        some bullshit IDs?  And you know 
                        what I get for it?  “Shut up, 
                        Stew.”  “Just drive, Stew.”  “Stop 
                        asking to borrow my iPod, Stew.”  
                        But you know what I’ve never heard 
                        you say? “Thank you, Stew.”  Did 
                        you know I write poetry?  No.  And 
                        that shit hurts, but I tell myself, 
                        it’s cool, cause Ben's my boy.  I 
                        know, when the shit goes down, 
                        he’ll be there for me.  Not cause 
                        it’s his job, cause he’s my friend. 

           Ben sees that for once in Stew’s life, he’s not full of shit.

                                 STEW (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t sell you out, man.  You 
                        need my help, you don’t have to 
                        break my nose, you just have to--

           Two silenced shots to the chest drop Stew to the ground.  

                                 VIN (O.S.)
                        My bad.  You two having a moment?

           Vin aims his silenced pistol at Ben, keys his walkie:
                                 VIN (IN JAPANESE) (CONT’D)
                        Find the family.  

           A CHOPPER rises next to the bridge, takes off overhead.

                                 CHOPPER PILOT (IN JAPANESE)
                             (on radio)
                        Roger on that, commencing sweep.  

                                 BEN
                        You don’t need them.  C’mon man, 
                        this is about us.  

                                 VIN
                        No.  It’s about my father.    

           Vin pistol-whips Ben, knocking him to his knees. 

                                 BEN
                        Oh right, the guy who made a 
                        fortune killing men, women and 
                        children and never let you sail 
                        with him on his boat.  Face it man, 
                        your dad was kind of a dick.  

           Vin grabs Ben's hair, presses the gun to his head.  

                                 VIN
                        My father was a great man.  I want 
                        you to die knowing your family will 
                        suffer for what you did to him.

           Vin pulls back the hammer, goes for the trigger just as --

           HONK!  Andie’s van ROCKETS straight at them.  Ben rolls for 
           cover as Vin free-falls into the river.  

           Ben rushes to look down to the water.  Vin’s gone.  

                                 BEN
                        Shit.

           David leans out from behind the wheel.  

                                 DAVID
                        Not bad for an old man, huh?

                                 BEN
                        You followed me?!  

           Andie jumps out of the back seat and heads straight for Ben.
                                 ANDIE
                        Not to be difficult but does 
                        somebody want to explain to me why 
                        we just drove a man off a bridge?!   

           MACHINE GUN FIRE pops down the pavement as three DARK SUVS 
           speed down the bridge, GUNMEN firing from tinted windows.  

           Ben tackles Andie behind Stew’s Smart Car, calls to David:   

                                 BEN
                        Go!

                                 DAVID
                        Where?

           Ben points away from the SUVS, stating the obvious.

                                 BEN
                        Where do you think?!  That way.  Go 
                        that way.  Just drive!  

           I/E. ANDIE’S MINIVAN - DRIVING - MORNING

           David buckles his seat belt, checks his mirrors, strangely 
           calm considering the cars of armed men speeding toward them.  

                                 IRENE
                        What’s going on?  David, we can’t 
                        just leave them.  

                                 DAVID
                        Ollie, control your mother.

           He shifts into drive and guns it, speeding across the bridge.   

           EXT. WARREN BRIDGE - MORNING

           Gunfire everywhere.  Ben pushes Andie into the SMART CAR --

           I/E. SMART CAR - DRIVING - MORNING

           The chopper lowers onto the bridge behind them.  They’re 
           trapped.  SUVS ahead.  Chopper behind.

                                 ANDIE
                        Um.  What’s that?  

           IN THE SUV a THUG readies a SHOULDER LAUNCHED ROCKET.
                                 BEN
                        You’re gonna want to buckle up.  

           Shifts into REVERSE, speeding backwards towards the hovering 
           chopper just as the ROCKET LAUNCHES -- seconds from impact --

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Hold on.

           Hits the brakes, palms the wheel-- they spin 180 degrees as 
           the rocket buzzes by and TAKES OUT THE CHOPPER INSTEAD. 

           The Smart Car races through the flaming debris... 

           I/E. SMART CAR - DRIVING - MORNING

           As the back windshield EXPLODES with gunfire...

                                 BEN
                        Stay down.

                                 ANDIE
                        Gee, you think?  Just drive!

           The cars speed onto the rocky terrain of a mountain road.

           Ben slams into SUV #1, knocking a GUNMAN out the window -- 
           the gunman grabs the car, starts climbing in Andie’s window --  

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.  Ben.

                                 BEN
                        Take the wheel.

           Andie slides behind the wheel as Ben goes for the gunman.

           I/E. MINIVAN - DRIVING - DAY

           David pulls up alongside the Smart Car, backing them closer 
           and closer to TWO SUVS OF ARMED THUGS behind them.   

                                 OLLIE
                             (nervously)
                        Um, Dad...

                                 DAVID
                        Okay, now what?  

                                 IRENE
                        Hit the car!  Hit the car!
           David THROWS THE MINIVAN AGAINST THE SMART CAR -- 

           I/E. SMART CAR - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

           And the Smart Car SKIDS to the edge of the road.  Ben, Andie 
           and the gunman bounce around inside.  Human pinballs.

                                 ANDIE
                        What are they doing?!

                                 BEN
                        I think they’re trying to help.  

           Another hit from David and the Smart Car SLIDES onto the 
           shoulder, inches from the cliff’s edge.

                                 ANDIE
                        Well, they’re gonna get us killed!  

           Ben's punching Gunman #1 in the face and yelling to the van:

                                 BEN
                        Don’t hit the car!

           I/E. ANDIE’S MINIVAN - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

           David can’t hear Ben over all the shooting.

                                 DAVID
                        What’s he saying?

                                 OLLIE
                        Think he wants you to hit the car.

           David jerks the wheel, SLAMMING them back into the Smart Car.  

           I/E. SMART CAR - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

           Gunman #2 on the roof, reaching in for Andie.  Ben kicks #1 
           from the car, reaches across Andie, pops the hood: it flips 
           over the roof, taking Gunman #2 right along with it.   

           Andie turns to Ben, impressed and horrified all at once:

                                 ANDIE
                        What kind of carpet cleaning 
                        salesman are you?!  

           Ben leans out the window, fires at the SUV: takes out both 
           front tires sending the SUV SOMERSAULTING down the road --  
           SUV #2 swerves onto a service road to avoid the wreck, starts 
           firing from the other side of the treeline. 

                                 BEN
                        Okay, this is our chance.   

           Ben takes the wheel as Andie slides over him.  He pulls 
           alongside the minivan, tries yelling to David.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Keep it straight.  

                                 DAVID
                        What?!  

                                 IRENE
                        Honey, we can’t hear you!

           There’s too much noise.  Ben turns to Andie. 

                                 BEN
                        Gimme your phone.  

           I/E. MINIVAN - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

           Ollie answers his phone.

                                 OLLIE
                        It’s Ben.  He says pull up 
                        alongside him.   

           Sparks fly as the two cars careen together.  

                                 DAVID
                        Whoops.  My fault.  That was me.   

           An icey glance from Irene and David evens it out.  

                                 OLLIE
                        Good.  Now keep it straight.  
                             (terrified by Ben's 
                              instructions)
                        Oh God.

           I/E. SMART CAR - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

           Andie watches Ollie and Leonard slide open the van door 
           across the speeding sea of rock and dirt.   

                                 ANDIE
                        Are you out of your mind?!
                                 BEN
                        You can do this.

           She moves to the door --

           I/E. ANDIE’S MINIVAN - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

           Leonard and Ollie reach out and take Andie’s arms.  

                                 ANDIE
                        Are you crying?

                                 OLLIE
                        It’s just stress!

           The Smart Car and the van speed side by side, Andie 
           stretching between them with rocks racing by below.  

                                 IRENE
                        Oh, this girl’s mother’s going to 
                        kill us.  

           SUDDENLY, the road erupts with gunfire from THREE THUGS ON 
           MOTORCYCLES barreling down behind them --  

           Andie DIVES into the van as bullets SHRED the road.  

                                 BEN
                        Go for the freeway! 

           EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

           Chopper firing down on the minivan...  

           A few exits behind, the Smart Car ROCKETS into the center 
           lane, chased by SUV #2 and the motorcycles.   

           I/E. SMART CAR - DRIVING - DAY

           Ben pops his door next to an EIGHTEEN WHEELER and JUMPS -- 
           Grabs the truck as the Smart Car SPINS INTO THE MEDIAN.  

           EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DRIVING - DAY

           Ben climbs up top, SURFING the massive truck.  Sun behind 
           him, firing at the CHOPPER, he’s one badass hero...  

           A THUG jumps from SUV #2 to the truck, catching a ride and 
           climbing up top as the SUV takes off after the minivan.   
           The thug sweeps Ben's leg, gun bouncing to the road below.   

           INT. ANDIE’S MINIVAN - DRIVING - DAY

           The family’s freaking out as Ben and the thug trade blows on 
           top of the speeding eighteen wheeler.  

                                 IRENE
                        David!  Do something!

           David slams on the horn: HOOONNNKK!  Irene isn’t impressed.  

           EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DRIVING - DAY

           The thug tosses Ben across the roof of the truck.  Ben rolls 
           to a stop at a giant pair of boots.  Looks up -- 

           SONNY.  And he’s got a shotgun.  

                                 BEN
                        Shit.

           Before Sonny can fire, Ben's back on his feet.   

           Now he’s monkey in the middle, fighting Sonny for the shotgun 
           with one hand, holding off the thug with the other.   

           I/E. ANDIE’S MINIVAN - DRIVING - DAY

           The family ducks for cover, taking fire from the motorcycles.

                                 OLLIE
                             (raging)
                        That’s it!

           Ollie pulls his GLOCK, aims at a MOTORCYCLE GUNMAN --  

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Safety off.  Point.  And...

           Ollie fires.  Perfect hit.  Gunman drops.  Victory!  Until 
           his bike goes sliding right into --

           THE EIGHTEEN WHEELER

                                 LEONARD
                        Uh oh.  

           As the DRIVER jerks the wheel and--

           Ben, Sonny and the thug FLIP RIGHT OFF THE TRUCK.
           The family screams as Sonny DROPS on their windshield.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh boy.

           Ben grabs hold of the ski rack just as he rolls off the roof. 

           The thug dangles from the back of the U-haul.

           The chopper peels off as the van speeds 

           INSIDE A TUNNEL

           The motorcycles swing behind the U-haul, firing on Ben as the 
           thug climbs up the U-haul, inching toward the van.    

           INSIDE THE VAN

           Sonny’s giant fist hammering away at the windshield...  

                                 IRENE
                        David!

                                 DAVID
                        I’m handling it.

           David fumbling around, flips on the wipers...

                                 LEONARD
                        Try honking at him.  

           BACK WITH BEN

           As he spots Andie emerging from the sunroof.

                                 ANDIE
                        Give me your hand!

                                 BEN
                        One sec.  Um... Sorry about this.

           Swings the shotgun at the U-haul and FIRES AT THE HITCH --

           THE U-HAUL SNAPS FREE FROM THE VAN, taking the thug with it 
           as it FLIPS AND PANCAKES the two motorcycles.  

           BACK ON BEN AND ANDIE 

           As they fall into the van and turn to watch all Andie’s 
           worldly possessions bounce across the highway.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Insurance will probably cover that.
                                 LEONARD
                        Doubtful. 

           Sonny’s giant arms yank Ollie through the sunroof --

           ON OLLIE, wind whipping across his face.

                                 OLLIE
                        I’m outside the car!  I’m outside 
                        the car!

           BACK WITH BEN

           As he slides up next to David.

                                 BEN
                        Dad.  Hard right on three.  

                                 DAVID
                        What?  

                                 BEN
                        One.  Two.

                                 DAVID
                        Right or left?

                                 BEN
                        Three.

           David jerks the wheel, Ben pops the parking brake, Ollie 
           SCREAMS for his life -- the van SPINS A 360, tossing Sonny --  

           He rolls across the blacktop and then, miraculously, rises to 
           his feet to watch the van speed off.  

           INSIDE THE VAN

           Leonard hands Ollie a FLASK, then pulls a second FLASK from 
           his pocket for himself.  They toast and drink. 

           EXT. SALVAGE YARD - DAY

           What’s left of the van rolls into the auto dump.  Andie’s out 
           the door before it even stops, Ben right behind her.

                                 BEN
                        This is about the U-haul, isn’t it?

           Andie whips around, getting in Ben's face. 
                                 ANDIE
                        Motorcycles and rockets and 
                        exploding helicopters --  

                                 BEN
                        Just one helicopter technically--

                                 ANDIE
                        Who are you people?!

           TITO, the laid-back yard owner strolls over with a beer.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        You have a phone? 

           Tito points around back.

           Irene and David watch Ben follow Andie around back.

                                 DAVID
                        We don’t fight like that, do we?

           Irene smiles with happy memories.

                                 IRENE
                        We used to.

           EXT. SALVAGE YARD - AROUND BACK - DAY

           Ben finds Andie dialing 911.  He grabs the phone, hangs up.

                                 BEN
                        You don’t want to call the police.     

           Out of nowhere, Andie clocks him in the face.  He stumbles 
           back, falling into some scrap metal.

                                 ANDIE
                        Shit.  I’m sorry.  You just picked 
                        a bad time to be patronizing.  

                                 BEN
                        Listen, I’m sorry I got you into 
                        this.  Really, I am.  But I got 
                        them into it too and I’m just... 
                        I’m trying to make it right.  All I 
                        need is one more day. Help me get 
                        them to New York and put them on 
                        this boat and then you can call 
                        whoever you want, I’ll disappear 
                        and everyone’s life can go back to 
                        being just like it was.   
           ON ANDIE, torn, as Ben walks off.  

           BACK BY THE VAN

           Tires blown.  Body dented and bullet ridden.  Glass 
           shattered.  It’s amazing the thing hasn’t blown up yet.  

           David watches Tito appraise the wreckage.

                                 TITO
                        Two hundred.

                                 DAVID
                        Tito, my friend.  Two hundred?  
                        Sure, there’s a little wear and 
                        tear,  but this girl’s only got 
                        seventy-thousand miles on her. 

           David gives the door a pat.  The rearview mirror breaks off.

                                 TITO
                        One Fifty. 

           As Ben returns, David pulls him aside, glances to Tito...

                                 DAVID
                        Son of a bitch is low-balling us.

                                 ANDIE (O.S.)
                        How about a trade instead?

           Irene beams as Andie joins the group.

           EXT. SALVAGE YARD - LATER

           The family stares up at a battered, old PRISON BUS.

                                 OLLIE
                        Anyone else see the irony in this? 

           Irene snaps a photo of the bus.  For the album.  

           Andie swipes the keys from Ben.

                                 ANDIE
                        My bus.  I drive.  

           EXT. RURAL MARYLAND BRIDGE - NIGHT

           The TASK FORCE BASE CAMP - a village of tents, trailers and 
           lights - has sprung up right off the bridge.  
           AGENTS, LOCAL COPS and PARAMEDICS sweep the bridge, sorting 
           through the wreckage as White holds a PRESS CONFERENCE.  

                                 WHITE
                        Dr. Mandel should be considered 
                        armed and extremely dangerous.  
                        Agent Patterson will take your 
                        questions.

           Patterson takes the mic as REPORTERS shout questions.

           White plows across the bridge, trailed by Dryer.

                        Nice speech.  What do you say we 
                        grab a slice of pie, box of wine --

                                 WHITE
                        There are women out there who 
                        actually mistake this for charm?  

                                 DRYER
                        Takes some time, but I grow on you. 
                        Listen, I think we may be chasing 
                        the wrong brother.  

                                 WHITE
                        Let me guess.  You’ve got a hunch.

           But before they can get into it:

                                 PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        We got a live one here!  

           Stew, just barely alive, rides a stretcher to an ambulance.  

           I/E. PRISON BUS - NIGHT

           Ben jolts up from a nap, David reading by his side. 

                                 DAVID
                        You know what Aeschylus said about 
                        nightmares?  Stepchildren of a 
                        guilty conscience.  

                                 BEN
                        We’re not moving...  Where’s mom? 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - ROAD BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s bumper to bumper for miles under a massive snow storm.  
           A POLICE ROAD BLOCK turns cars off the interstate.
           Ben finds Irene happily chatting with a LOCAL COP.

                                 LOCAL COP
                        Bethany here will be five in April.

           He hands Irene a photo from his wallet. 

                                 IRENE
                        Oh, look at that.  She’s an angel.
                             (spots Ben)
                        Ben, honey, isn’t she adorable?

                                 LOCAL COP
                        I was just telling Irene, this 
                        storm’s got roads shut down till 
                        morning.  Plenty of motels though, 
                        back near town.  

           A beat as Ben processes all that’s wrong with this scene.

                                 BEN
                        Great.  Thanks.  Mom.  Kinda cold.

                                 IRENE
                        Oh, right.  George, honey, you’re a 
                        dear.  Fingers crossed for a boy.  
                        Third time’s a charm!

           Ben leads Irene back to the bus. 

                                 BEN
                        Do me a favor.  Stop making 
                        friends.

           EXT. COW POKE MOTEL AND SALOON - NIGHT

           A GUEST returns from the ice machine, double-takes at the 
           PRISON BUS blocking half the snow-covered lot.   

           INT. COW POKE SALOON - NIGHT

           Stressed and exhausted, the family follows a VOLUPTUOUS 
           WAITRESS to a table by the crowded dance floor.  

           They drop into their seats as Ollie nervously glances around.

                                 OLLIE
                        Isn’t this a little... exposed?   

                                 LEONARD
                        View looks good to me. 
           Leonard flashes the waitress a smile as she hands him a menu.  

           Ben's drawing on a napkin, zoned out so he doesn’t have to 
           stop and think about the loss of Stew and Coop.

                                 BEN
                        Nobody will see us unless you give 
                        ‘em a reason to.  

                                 OLLIE
                        Yeah?  What about seeing them?  

           Ben keeps drawing, doesn’t even bother looking up:

                                 BEN
                        Couple walking in just finished 
                        fighting outside, drunk on the 
                        phone’s trying to convince his wife 
                        he’s not actually drunk, and the 
                        bartender’s got a limp on his left 
                        side, probably tore his ACL playing 
                        at Penn State.  Center, maybe 
                        offensive tackle.

           Ollie’s eyes move around the bar: the TENSE COUPLE by the 
           door; the DRUNK babbling into the phone; the HEFTY BARTENDER 
           in his Penn State sweatshirt. 

           As the waitress brings their drinks, Ollie relents: 

                                 OLLIE
                        Midori Sour.    

                                 IRENE
                        You know what I just realized?  
                        This is the most time we’ve spent 
                        together since you two were just 
                        little boys.  

           The truth of the observation catches everyone a little off 
           guard.  Irene turns to Andie, caught up in a happy memory.

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        Every year, when they were little, 
                        we used to pack them up in the car 
                        and drive to David’s brother’s in 
                        Philadelphia for Thanksgiving.  And 
                        let me tell you, that man’s no 
                        treat.  But you know, I always 
                        loved those trips.  Something about 
                        being together as a family.  No 
                        matter the hours of traffic or how 
                        much the boys fought...  
                                 (MORE)
                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        All you think at the time is only 
                        crazy people would put themselves 
                        through this.  But then a couple of 
                        years go by and then a couple after 
                        that and before you know it, you’re 
                        sitting in your big, empty house 
                        wondering what’s wrong with a 
                        little crazy?  

           Irene’s teared up.  David calls over the waitress.

                                 DAVID
                        Excuse me.  Would you mind taking a 
                        picture for us?

           The waitress takes the camera as they all gather around 
           Irene.  Irene notices Andie, sitting off to the side.

                                 IRENE
                        Wait, wait.  Andie, dear, you too.  

                                 ANDIE
                        Oh, no.  That’s okay.  

                                 IRENE
                        C’mon get over here.  Next to Ben.   

           Andie takes her place, snuggling into this strange family.

                                 VOLUPTUOUS WAITRESS
                        Alright, ya’ll.  Say cheese.

           INT. COW POKE MOTEL SALOON - LATER

           A slow country song plays as Irene and David sit alone at the 
           table watching COUPLES sway in each other’s arms.

           David’s smiling at Irene like he hasn’t in a long time. 

                                 DAVID
                        God you’re a knockout. 

                                 IRENE
                             (totally distracted)
                        Shouldn’t Leonard be back by now?  

                                 DAVID
                        Irene.

           She looks up to find David standing, hand out-stretched.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Wanna dance?    
           INT. COW POKE MOTEL SALOON - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

           David leads Irene to the center of the dance floor.  

                                 DAVID
                        You’ll have to bear with me.  I 
                        haven’t done this since--

                                 IRENE
                        Cousin Toby’s wedding.  March 1989.  

           They share a smile and relax.  Slowly, they begin to dance.   

           INT. COW POKE MOTEL SALOON - BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Ollie and Ben sit at the bar watching David and Irene take 
           control of the dance floor, putting on quite the show.  

                                 BEN
                        Um, is it me or can Dad, you 
                        know... dance?

           Sure enough, David’s got some moves.  Old school.

           Ollie’s feeling Midori Sour number two.  Not a big drinker. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Eight months I’ve been working with 
                        them on their relationship.  Phone 
                        calls, e-mails, weekend retreats to 
                        practice their intimacy--

                                 BEN
                        Techniques.  Right.  You really 
                        gotta stop saying those two words 
                        together like that.    

                                 OLLIE
                        But two days on the road with 
                        you...  

           Ollie nods to the dance floor where David dips Irene. 

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        I guess I shouldn’t be surprised.   

                                 BEN
                        What?  C’mon, you’re like off on 
                        safari saving orphans and shit.   

                                 OLLIE
                        Yeah well, I had big shoes to fill.
           Ben looks to Ollie, not quite getting it.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        I traveled halfway around the world 
                        just so when I came home they’d 
                        talk about something other than 
                        you.  And it was working too until 
                        you had to go and become a spy.

                                 BEN
                        I’m not a spy.  

                                 OLLIE
                        Oh, right.

           Ollie drunkenly zips his lips and tosses the key.

           FLASH.  Andie snaps their photo with Irene’s camera.

                                 ANDIE
                        I just remembered everything I own 
                        is on the I-83.  Which one of you 
                        is buying me a drink?

           INT. ST. CECILIA’S HOSPITAL - STEW’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Stew’s up in bed, working his way through a Happy Meal.  
           White and Patterson watch in disbelief.  

                                 STEW
                        Where my nuggets?  I don’t see

           Dryer’s flipping through Stew’s wallet.  Finds something.  

           TIGHT ON: Stew’s SCRUB-A-RUG CARPET CLEANING CARD.

           Ben, Andie and Ollie drunkenly stumble back to their rooms as

                        How was that?

                                 BEN
                        Really... hot. 

                                 OLLIE
                        I’m on the floor.  How’d I get to 
                        the floor?    

           Ben lifts Ollie to his feet. 

                                 ANDIE
                        Thanks for the ninja training. 
           Andie plants a kiss on both of their cheeks, lingering a beat 
           on Ben's, before disappearing into her room. 

           OUTSIDE OLLIE AND DAVID’S DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben and Ollie find a sock hanging on the door knob.

                                 BEN
                        Dude.  There’s a sock on your door.  

           Ollie bends over, pulls up his pants, checks both his feet.  

                                 OLLIE
                        Not mine.  

           He reaches to unlock the door, but Ben stops him.

                                 BEN
                        Wait.  Did you hear that?  

           Irene passionately MOANS from the other side of the door.

           Ben and Ollie stumble through the door.  Stop.  

           The voluptuous waitress stands butt-naked, lighting a 
           cigarette.  Bed’s clearly gone through a work-out.  The 
           shower runs in the bathroom.  She takes a long drag, then:

           Andie, now in her pj’s, finds Ben and Ollie at her door.   

                                 BEN
                        We’ve got Oreos.  

           INT. COW POKE MOTEL - ANDIE AND IRENE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Dark except for the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving Special on TV.

           Ollie’s passed out, still clinging to his handle of Rum.

           Ben and Andie split Oreos on the floor, drinking Dr. Pepper.
                                 ANDIE 
                        I saw my clients getting married 
                        and then all my friends and I guess 
                        I just really wanted Terry to be 
                        the one.  So I kept telling myself 
                        it was okay he wasn’t that nice to 
                        me.  Then one day it just wasn’t. 

           Ben nods, letting the moment sit.  Andie smiles, shrugs.

                                 BEN
                        Want me to kill him?

                        It just didn’t turn out like I 
                        thought it would, you know?

                                 BEN
                        Um yeah, think I can relate. 

           As Charlie Brown goes to commercial, Ben starts flipping 
           channels and Andie heads to the bathroom.

                                 ANDIE

                        I’m gonna need that rum.  

           Ben grabs the bottle and his coat, starts for the door as the 
           toilet FLUSHES in the bathroom.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)

           Ben bolts out the door as Andie returns to find Ollie alone.

           It’s still dark as David wakes to find Irene getting dressed.    

                                 DAVID
                        What time is it?  

                                 IRENE
                        Early but if we get up now I can 
                        get back to the room before the 
                        boys are awake. 

                                 DAVID
                        Irene--

                                 IRENE
                        Can you believe how much we had to 
                        drink?

           He pulls her down to the bed.

                                 DAVID
                        We’ve been together for thirty-five 
                        years.  We’ve bought a home, raised 
                        two sons, built a life.  The road 
                        hasn’t always been smooth, but 
                        we’ve been on it together.  And all 
                        this, the past few months, it’s all 
                        just been... a speed bump.  

                                 IRENE
                        You’re calling our divorce a speed 
                        bump?  
                                 DAVID
                        It’s a metaphor.  What I’m saying 
                        is whatever it is you’ve been 
                        feeling, it will pass, like a cloud 
                        in the sky, and then we can go back 
                        to the way things have always been.  

           She softens, smiles and in that smile David sees hope. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you see?  Last night... It 
                        can be a fresh start.  

                                 IRENE
                        Oh, David.  It wasn’t a fresh 
                        start.  It was goodbye.

           She plants a soft kiss on his forehead and turns for the 
           door, silently breaking down as she opens it --   

           Only to find Andie rushing in with Ollie.

                                 ANDIE

                        Okay, maybe the speed-bump wasn’t

                        Stew?

           steady.  How?  He follows the cord, not to Stew, but to --

           A COP sprawled across the floor on the other side of the bed, 
           unconscious.  Stew’s EKG sensor attached to his finger.

                        Sorry kid.  You’re a little late.

           Ben turns around.  Can’t believe his eyes.  Even in a pair of 
           scrubs, there’s no mistaking the man before him:  Coop.

           The cop sweeps his flashlight over the frozen smiles of the

                        Unless...  He doesn’t know you were 
                        behind the hit on his old man.

                        No, that was what you might call a

                        And why risk a hit on Vin when you 
                        can make him an offer, right?  

           EXT. JAPANESE CEMETERY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Vin broods at his father’s funeral.  

           REVEAL Coop among the MOURNERS, eyes on Vin, Bob at his side.  

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        I wanted a piece of the family 
                        business.  The kid wanted his 
                        father’s killer.  

           EXT. JAPANESE CEMETERY - LATER (FLASHBACK)

           As the funeral breaks up, Coop introduces himself to Vin.

           Back to Ben and Coop. 

                                 BEN
                        So who does he think you are?  CIA?

                        Old family friend, used to sail 
                        with his folks back in the day.  
                        Think it was the line about him 
                        having his mother’s eyes that 
                        really sold it though.    

                                 BEN
                        You don’t figure even Vin will get 
                        around to asking who sent me after 
                        dad in the first place?

                                 COOP
                        You pulled the trigger but I still 
                        needed a man behind the curtain -- 

                                 BEN
                        So you served up El Tio and bet Vin 
                        wouldn’t waste time playing twenty 
                        questions.  
           EXT. PRISON BUS/ST. CECILIA’S HOSPITAL - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           The cop’s got David, Irene, Ollie and Leonard lined up, hands 
           on the bus, as he finishes patting them down.  

                                 COP
                        Wait here.  

           He heads back to the patrol car as Ollie breaks down.    

                                 OLLIE
                        This is it.  My life is over.

                        Breathe son, breathe.  
                             (turns to Irene)
                        What if we went away for a few 
                        weeks?  Mexico maybe.

                                 LEONARD
                        I once spent four days in 
                        Guadalajara locked up with Bob 
                        Mitchum on a phony dope charge. 

                                 IRENE
                             (nervously)
                        Oh, where’s Ben?  

           INT. ST. CECILIA’S HOSPITAL - STEW’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben's backed himself against the wall by Stew’s bed.  

                                 BEN
                        You were like a father.

                                 COOP
                        If it makes you feel any better, 
                        I’m gonna feel real bad about this 
                        in the morning.  

           Ben PULLS the EKG sensor off the cop -- Stew’s EKG FLATLINES 
           and the CODE BLUE ALARM SOUNDS as --

           Ben flips a TRAY at Coop and RACES across the room, HURLING 
           himself through the window...

           I/E. SQUAD CAR/ST. CECILA’S HOSPITAL - BACK ALLEY - SAME

           The cop is radioing for back-up... 

                                 COP
                        Northeast alley.  Requesting back--
           THUMP.  Ben BOUNCES off the roof of the car.  

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Jesus.  

           The cop draws his pistol, steps out of the car and HITS the 
           pavement.  Hard.  Never comes back up.  Ben does instead.

           Ben ducks behind the wheel, sets to work hot-wiring the car.  

           TAP TAP.  He bolts up, ready to strike, but finds --

           Irene outside the window.  All smiles.  

           INT. ST. CECILIA’S HOSPITAL - STEW’S ROOM - SAME

           Coop hides his gun as DOCTORS and NURSES rush to Stew.  

                                 COOP
                        Call security.

           And Coop deftly disappears amidst the chaos.  

           I/E. PRISON BUS/ST. CECILIA’S HOSPITAL - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           The family hustles on board, Ben drops into a seat by Ollie.  

                                 BEN
                        Next time you’re getting the 
                        sleeper hold.

                                 IRENE
                        Oh shhh, your brother was--

                                 BEN
                        Just trying to help.  Right.  We 
                        gotta get to the harbor.  

           As the bus barrels out of the alley.

           EXT. BROOKLYN HARBOR - DAWN

           The GERMAN FREIGHTER waits at the end of the dock.  The 
           family huddles in the shadow of massive cargo containers.  

           Ben limps back from negotiating with a BEEFY DOCKWORKER.  

                                 BEN
                        Okay, everything’s set.  Frank over 
                        there will get you guys below deck.
                                 IRENE
                        Ben, honey, it’s not too late.  You 
                        can still come with us. 

                                 BEN
                        No, mom.  I can’t.   

           Irene throws her arms around him.  Holds him close.  

                                 IRENE
                        I love you very much.

           Ben pulls back.  Stops.  Listens.  In the air...  

           A CHOPPER rises above the ship.  And then another overhead.    

           CARS skid from every direction.  Sirens.  Weapons.  White.

           Ben, Andie and the family freeze in place.  Hands raised.  

           EXT. BROOKLYN HARBOR - MORNING

           Pandemonium.  Dock crammed with law enforcement.  Local.  
           State.  Federal.  You’d think they’d found Bin Laden.  

           An AGENT escorts a frantic Ollie to an ARMORED TRUCK.

                                 OLLIE
                        I don’t know about any Asian Dawn, 
                        I’m an Opthamologist!  

           WITH BEN, as he’s cuffed and loaded into a squad car. 

                                 BEN
                        You’re making a mistake.  You can’t 
                        take us in like this.  

           FIND WHITE giving orders on her way back to her SUV.

                                 WHITE
                        Nothing to the media until we’re 
                        airborne. 

           Dryer catches up with her.  He’s carrying a stack of files.

                                 DRYER
                        Got a minute?

                                 WHITE
                        What does it look like?

                                 DRYER
                        Great, I’ll drive.  
           As Dryer goes for the SUV we KEEP MOVING TO --

           A cuffed Irene demanding Patteron’s attention.  

                                 IRENE
                        Excuse me.  I can’t ride with him.  

           She nods to David.  He shrugs: Welcome to the family, kid. 

           I/E. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - MORNING

           David rides in the back with Ben, both cuffed.  Eyes on the 
           road ahead, Ben starts unfastening his watch behind his back.

                                 DAVID
                        You know, Ben, I love your mother.  
                        I really do.  But the woman’s nuts.  
                        I have no idea what she wants. 
                             (Off Ben)
                        What are you doing?

           Ben snaps the small metal clasp off the watch.  Patterson’s 
           at the wheel.  He glances in the rearview.  Ben smiles.

           EXT. BALTIMORE STREETS - MORNING

           Intersections freeze for the CARAVAN OF GOVERNMENT CARS.  

           I/E. WHITE AND DRYER’S SUV - MOVING - MORNING

           Dryer behind the wheel, White looking over Stew’s card.  In 
           the back are Leonard, Andie and Irene.  

                                 WHITE

                                 DRYER
                        That’s the same outfit Ben Mandel 
                        works for.  I spent the night going 
                        over their financials.  Whole 
                        company’s just a front.  

           She opens the folders, flips through the financial records of 
           Scrub-A-Rug and hits a stack of reports.

                                 WHITE
                        Dryer, these are --

                                 WHITE
                        What kind of front?

                                 DRYER
                        2006, rebel leader in the Congo.

                        All high-profile hits.  All open 
                        cases.  And there are a dozen more 
                        just like them, going all the way 
                        back to ‘89, same year Scrub-A-Rug 
                        filed its first tax return.  

                                 WHITE
                        You’re saying this carpet company 
                        is what?  Some kind of covert, 
                        assassination squad?  Hits for hire 
                        gone global?

                                 DRYER
                        What I’m saying is we’re in over 
                        our heads and Ben Mandel may be our 
                        only way out.

           Irene inserts herself from the backseat:

                                 IRENE
                        Which is what we’ve been trying to 
                        tell you.  

                                 LEONARD
                        But what do we know?  We’re just 
                        taxpayers.    

           EXT. CARAVAN - MOVING - MORNING

           Speeding down the freeway now in this order:

           LEAD CAR -- OLLIE’S ARMORED TRUCK -- WHITE & DRYER’S SUV -- 
           DAVID & BEN’S SQUAD CAR -- TAIL CAR.    

           The CARAVAN stops at a wall of traffic.  Construction ahead.

           ON WHITE, fuming in the SUV as Dryer’s eyes scan the bridge.  
                                 WHITE
                        We’re too exposed.
                             (grabs the radio)
                        Switch over to surface streets.  

           The caravan rolls toward the off-ramp...

           EXT. BROOKLYN FREEWAY - OFF-RAMP - MORNING

           Only to find the exit blocked by a stalled SCHOOL BUS.  The 
           STOP SIGN slowly folds out from the side of the bus.  Cute.

           IN THE LEAD CAR

           The AGENT behind the wheel lays on the horn as -- 

           The back door of the SCHOOL BUS pops open, revealing a THUG 
           with a ROCKET LAUNCHER.  He fires into the LEAD CAR.  MASSIVE 
           EXPLOSION, flames whipping back across --   

           THE ARMORED TRUCK 

           DRIVER and AGENT panicking.  What’s left of the LEAD CAR now 
           a burning roadblock straight ahead.  

                                 ARMORED TRUCK AGENT
                        Holy shit!  Back up!

           The truck CRASHES into the cars behind -- chain reaction --

           Patterson’s knocked out as David and Ben's car takes a hit -- 

                                 BEN
                        Dad, get down.  

           AS A ROCKET SAILS RIGHT OVER THEM AND TAKES OUT THE TAIL CAR

           Trapping the caravan in the middle of an ambush.

           UP AT THE HEAD OF THE CARAVAN

           GUNMEN rush from the SCHOOL BUS, plant explosives under the 
           ARMORED TRUCK.  Three, two, one, BOOM!  

           The ARMORED TRUCK FLIPS over the guard rail and plummets to

           THE STREET BELOW - INSIDE THE ARMORED TRUCK

           The AGENTS dead, Ollie dazed and bloodied.  
           I/E. WHITE AND DRYER’S SUV - MORNING

           Taking fire from just about everywhere.  

                                 WHITE
                             (turning to Dryer)
                        I think we can flank--

           But Dryer’s already gone...

                                 WHITE (CONT’D)
                        Dryer!  

           EXT. BROOKLYN FREEWAY/CARAVAN - MORNING

           MOVING WITH DRYER as he LEAPS to the street below and -- 

           Trades fire with the THUGS blow-torching the ARMORED TRUCK. 

           BACK UP TOP WITH WHITE AND THE FAMILY 

                                 WHITE
                        Stay here!

           White grabs the SHOTGUN off the dash and takes off. 

                                 ANDIE
                        She left us!

                                 LEONARD
                        Typical bureaucrat.   

           Irene grabs the radio under a rain of more GUNFIRE.

           I/E. BEN AND DAVID’S SQUAD CAR - BACKSEAT - MORNING

           Pinned between another SQUAD CAR and a CONCRETE BARRIER.  
           Patterson out cold behind the wheel.  

           Ben picks David’s cuffs.  David starts searching the seat:

                                 DAVID
                        You don’t see my glasses, do you?

                                 BEN
                        The door, dad.  The door!

                                 DAVID
                        Right. 
                             (tries the door)
                        Locked.  
           The radio crackles:

                                 IRENE (ON RADIO)
                        Is anyone there?  Where’s the on... 

                                 DAVID
                        Irene?

                                 LEONARD  (ON RADIO) 
                        You have to push the button.

                                 ANDIE (ON RADIO)
                        Gimme that.  HELP!

                                 BEN
                        Dad, you gotta break the glass.  

                                 DAVID
                        Of a police car?  

                                 BEN
                        Not a lot of options here!

           David starts kicking the window as --

           THUMP.  THUMP.  THUMP.  David stops kicking.  

                                 DAVID
                        Do you hear that?  

           A CHOPPER DESCENDS, HOVERING ABOVE THE ARMORED CAR

           Where they finish TORCHING the door, SPLITTING IT OPEN as --

           A THUG repels from the chopper, harnesses himself to Ollie.

                                 HARNESS THUG (IN JAPANESE)
                             (into walkie)
                        I have the package.  Go.

           ON OLLIE’S TERRIFIED FACE as he and the thug are LIFTED INTO 
           THE AIR and CARRIED OFF BY THE CHOPPER.  All over in seconds.

           BACK WITH BEN AND DAVID - MOMENTS LATER

           The window finally pops, David climbs out, reaches for Ben...

                                 BEN
                        My leg’s stuck.  You gotta drive.

                                 DAVID
                        Without my glasses?  

           Over the radio:  Gunfire.  Screaming.  Time running out.
                                 BEN
                        I can be your eyes.  You just have 
                        to trust me.

           ON DAVID, it all comes down to this, moment of truth...  

           I/E. BEN AND DAVID’S SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - MORNING

           Engine REVS to life, foot SLAMS on the gas and they’re off...

           David, blind at the wheel, Ben navigating from the backseat --

           SPEEDING DOWN THE FREEWAY -- WEAVING AROUND BURNING CARS --  

                                 BEN
                        Easy, easy.  Left!

           David jerks the wheel and they TAKE OUT A THUG - the body 
           flipping over the hood -- 

                                 DAVID
                        What was that?

                                 BEN
                        Right!

           Another TURN, another THUG BOUNCES OFF THE WINDSHIELD --

                                 DAVID
                             (turns around in his seat)
                        You’re aiming for them, aren’t you?

                                 BEN
                        Eyes on the road!

                                 DAVID
                        I can’t see the road!

                                 BEN
                        Brake!

           David BRAKES -- FISHTAILING -- MOWING DOWN A FINAL THUG LIKE 
           A BOWLING PIN just before he can fire on the family’s SUV.  

                                 IRENE (O.S.)
                        David?

                                 DAVID
                        Oh God, did we hit your mother?  
           EXT. UNDERPASS/ARMORED TRUCK - MORNING

           TIGHT ON: Dryer’s gun sliding across the pavement.

           Dryer mixes it up with a THUG.  Old-school against ninja.  
           Dryer goes down.  Ninja goes for the gun.  BANG BANG BANG.  

           The rounds rip through the ninja’s chest.  He drops --

           REVEALING Ben, gun still smoking.  

           Dryer slowly rises, hands in the air. 

                                 DRYER
                        Talk to me about Scrub-A-Rug.

                                 BEN
                        I come in now, my brother’s dead.  

           ON DRYER, instinct battling it out with common sense.    

           Ben holds out the gun, taking the first step toward trust...

                                 WHITE  (O.S.)
                        Drop the weapon!  Now!

           REVEAL White in textbook firing position.  

           Ben drops the gun and Dryer picks it up, moves to cuff him --

                                 DRYER
                        Sorry, kid.  

                                 BEN
                        Yeah.  Me too.

           Ben disarms Dryer, spins behind him, gun on White.  

                                 DRYER
                        Nice move.

                                 BEN
                        Thanks.  
                             (to White)
                        Drop it.  

           Reluctantly, White lowers her gun.  

           EXT. UNDERPASS/ARMORED TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben covers Irene as she finishes cuffing Dryer and White to 
           the steering wheel of the Armored Truck.
                                 IRENE
                        Hope that’s not too tight.
                             (to White)
                        That’s a lovely necklace.  

                                 WHITE
                             (awkwardly)
                        Thank you.

           Ben and Irene join David, Andie and Leonard in the battered 
           squad car and peel off.  

                                 DRYER
                        Plans for dinner later?

           I/E. PRIVATE AIRPORT - HELICOPTER HANGAR - MORNING

           Vin stands over a golf ball, lining up a putt... 

           The hole?  Ollie’s mouth.  He’s across the hangar, THUG’s 
           foot pressed against his neck, pinning him to the floor.  

                                 VIN
                        You said he’d be in the truck.  

                                 COOP
                        Not my problem your boys left the 
                        kitchen without checking the order.   

           Vin putts.  The ball rolls... straight into Ollie’s mouth.  

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        Look, two organizations merge, 
                        there’s bound to be a little 
                        friction.  East meets West and all. 

                                 VIN
                        We merge when you deliver what you 
                        promised. 
                             (switching to Japanese)
                        This limp-dicked motherfucker’s 
                        trying my patience.  

                                 COOP
                        Easy, kid.  Might want to slow down 
                        before you hurt my feelings.  

           Coop’s tone is cool, backed by a sense of real power.  

           The room goes quiet and for an instant it seems like these 
           two sides could very well go to war until --
           I’M SO EXCITED echoes through the suite.  Takes a few seconds 
           for everyone to process.  It’s a ringtone... from Ollie.  

           Bob hands Coop Ollie’s phone.    

           EXT. BROOKLYN PAY-PHONE - MORNING

           Ben on the phone, family huddled around him.  

                                 BEN (INTO PHONE)
                        I want to make a trade.  I come in, 
                        you let my brother walk. 

           INTERCUT WITH COOP/VIN/OLLIE IN THE HANGAR

                                 COOP
                        Sounds fair.  There’s a private 
                        airfield twenty miles--

                                 BEN
                        I don’t think so.  You want me, we 
                        do it my way.  Time Warner Center.  
                        One hour.  You and Vin.  In person.  

           Coop can feel Vin’s eyes on him.  Knows it’s his only play.

                                 COOP
                        Deal.  Kid, I see a cop, a Fed, an 
                        overeager security guard--

                                 BEN
                        Yeah.  I know.  

           Ben hangs up.  Looks at the family, gathered around him.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        This might get a little crazy.  
                        Sure you guys are up for it?  

                                 DAVID
                        What’s wrong with a little crazy?  

           As David flashes a knowing smile, a new life in his eyes.  

           EXT. UNDERPASS/ARMORED TRUCK - MORNING

           Amidst the whirlwind of NYPD and FEDERAL AGENTS we find --

           Patterson, ice-pack against his head, running a radio to 
           White and Dryer, uncuffed and on their way to a HELICOPTER.
                                 PATTERSON
                        Dispatch is patching it through.   
                        Says they’re heading for Manhattan.  

           INTERCUT WITH DAVID AND IRENE IN THE BATTERED SQUAD CAR

           David behind the wheel, Irene on the radio.

                                 IRENE
                        Agent White, hi, I just wanted to 
                        apologize for how we left things 
                        with you and that other agent.  By 
                        the way, is it strictly 
                        professional between you two, 
                        because I definitely sensed some 
                        chemistry there.

                                 WHITE (OVER RADIO)
                        Mrs. Mandel, I urge you to turn 
                        yourselves in before-- 

                                 IRENE
                        Oh, gotta run.  Happy Thanksgiving.  

           BACK WITH WHITE AND DRYER, climbing on board the chopper.

                                 WHITE
                        Why stick with a car we can trace? 

                                 DRYER
                        Maybe that’s the point. 

           And the chopper lifts off, banking over the East River.

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING

           David and Irene’s patrol car speeds toward Manhattan as the 
           sun climbs over the city on a cold Thanksgiving morning. 

                                 RADIO NEWSCAST (V.O.)
                        Thousands have already turned out 
                        this morning for the annual Macy’s 
                        Thanksgiving Day Parade.  

           EXT. TIME WARNER CENTER - MORNING

           A massive glass encased shopping center overlooking 

           COLUMBUS CIRCLE 

           Where NEW YORKERS crowd the sidewalk watching the PARADE.  
           INT. TIME WARNER CENTER - LOBBY - MORNING

           Vin and his thugs strong-arm Ollie into an atrium mobbed with 
           HOLIDAY SHOPPERS.  Coop pulls Bob aside as they follow:

                                 COOP
                        Soon as he shows, take him down.  

           Bob nods and quietly splits off...     

           A WOMAN IN A CAP bumps into Vin as she passes:  

                                 WOMAN
                        Woops.  Sorry about that.  

           It’s Andie.  She slips something into Vin’s coat pocket.  

           FOLLOW ANDIE, moving through the crowd, passing --

           LEONARD and giving him nod.  A plan’s in motion.  Like 
           Ocean’s 11, but with more neuroses and less style. 

           As Leonard crosses the lobby into --

           INT. TIME WARNER CENTER - HUGO BOSS STORE - MORNING

           A SNOOTY CLERK eyes him like he’s got The Plague.

                                 SNOOTY CLERK
                        Can I help you?  

                                 LEONARD
                        You can sure as hell try.

           Leonard pulls a suit from the rack, shoves it at the clerk. 

           EXT. HELIPORT - MORNING

           White and Dryer climb out of the chopper and race to a fleet

           David at the wheel, Irene buckled in beside him, eyeing the

           watching Coop as she pretends to browse a rack of dresses.  

                                 ANDIE (INTO PHONE)
                        On your left, there’s an escalator 
                        to the mezzanine.  Send Ollie, 
                        alone.  He gets on, you get Ben.

                        tricks up his sleeve, after all...  

           Coop starts moving through the crowd, scanning suspects.  

           ON VIN, eyeing Coop, when his pocket starts to VIBRATE.  He 
           discovers the DROP PHONE Andie planted, answers it:

                        Don’t lurk.  It’s unseemly.  

           Leonard shuts the door, pulls out a matchbook from the motel 
           and a pack of his Lucky Strikes.  
           I/E. DRYER AND WHITE’S SUV - MOVING - MORNING

           Dryer JUMPS THE CURB, spins them into pursuit...

           I/E. DAVID AND IRENE’S SQUAD CAR - MOVING - MORNING

           David and Irene zipping through TRAFFIC at breakneck speed --

                        I said left.  You never listen--

                        Irene, I’ve loved you since the 
                        moment I set eyes on you and if you 
                        give me another chance I’ll spend 
                        the rest of my life showing you 
                        just how much but for now sit 
                        still, shut up and let me drive.  

           Irene’s speechless as David weaves into ONCOMING TRAFFIC...

           INT. TIME WARNER CENTER - LOBBY - MORNING

           Ollie crosses the lobby and steps onto the ESCALATOR.  

           INT. TIME WARNER CENTER - HUGO BOSS STORE - SAME

           The clerk smells something odd.  Goes to the dressing room.  

                                 SNOOTY CLERK
                        Sir, you can’t smoke in the store.  
                             (still nothing)
                        Sir? 

           The clerk opens the door.  Leonard’s gone.  And the suit is 
           ON FIRE, the pack of cigarettes BURNING in its breast pocket.

           Coop watches Ollie ride the escalator to the mezzanine.

           Andie watches Coop, Vin and the thugs caught in the  
           whirlwind of panicking shoppers.  She smiles, turns to go --    

           Spinning straight into BOB.  Not good.  

           INT. TIME WARNER CENTER - LOBBY - SAME

           Vin’s still on the phone with Ben.

                        Hey, old man.  I got a question for 
                        you.  You said I got my mother’s 
                        eyes, right, so this should be 
                        easy.

                        What was her name?   

                                 COOP
                        Sorry?

                        My mother.  What was her name?

           ON COOP.  Fucked.  And he knows it.

                        Boss!

           A thug points to the escalator.  Ollie’s gone.  

           UP ON THE MEZZANINE

           Ben sneaks Ollie to a side stairwell...

           DOWN IN THE LOBBY

           Bob and Andie join Coop, Vin, Sonny and the thugs.    

           Thugs pull guns on Coop, Bob levels his own gun on Vin.

           He pulls Andie close to his side.

           ON COOP, his voice echoing through the empty atrium.

                                 COOP
                        I’m going to count to three, then 
                        I’m gonna put a bullet in her head.

           Ben appears at the top of the escalator.

           MOVING WITH OLLIE AND LEONARD as they take cover in a MODEL 
           KITCHEN, peeking around the counter to watch --
           Ben with Coop and Vin in the lobby.  Guns all around him. 

                                 LEONARD
                        Not sure that’s part of the plan.

           Ollie looks off to the BACK EXIT and then back to Ben.  
           Decision time.  He grabs a CHEF’S KNIFE off the counter. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Okay, Ollie.  Time to save the day.   

           INT. TIME WARNER CENTER - LOBBY - MORNING

           Vin’s thugs grab Ben.  Who steps forward to search him?  
           Sonny.   Bruised.  Scarred.  Alive.  Guy’s a Terminator.  

                                 BEN
                        Dude, what happened to your face?  

           Sonny drops Ben to the floor with a fist across the face. 

                                 SONNY (IN JAPANESE)
                        He’s clean.  

                                 VIN (IN JAPANESE)
                        Kill them both.  The girl too.

                        Nobody move!

           Ollie leaps behind Bob, kitchen knife to his throat.  

                                 BEN
                        Oh God.  

                                 OLLIE
                        Everyone listen up cause I’m only 
                        going to say this once!  This has 
                        been the worst day in the worst 
                        week of my life so I swear to God 
                        I’m ready to take down every last 
                        one of you sons of bitches, 
                        starting with this motherfucker 
                        right here--    

           BANG.  BANG.  Coop fires two shots into Bob’s chest.  Bob 
           drops to the floor, dead, leaving Ollie totally exposed.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        He... He shot my human shield.  

           Ollie starts to hyperventilate as Coop turns to Ben.
                                 COOP
                        Looks like you’re out of surprises.  

           But Ben’s smiling.  Not at Coop.  But right past him to --  

           DAVID AND IRENE’S SQUAD CAR BLAZING ACROSS COLUMBUS CIRCLE --

           Leading an army of law enforcement right to them --

                                 IRENE
                        Oh look, the parade. 

           THE SQUAD CAR ROCKETS PAST THE PARADE AND STRAIGHT THROUGH 
           THE GLASS FACADE -- 

           Ben COVERS Andie and Ollie -- Coop and Vin DIVE for cover --

           Three stories of glass EXPLODING over them --

           As THE SQUAD CAR CRASHES right into Sonny.  

           EXT. TIME WARNER CENTER - SAME

           SUVS and NYPD CARS slide into a perimeter.  AGENTS and COPS 
           hit the pavement, taking fire from the thugs inside.

           INT. TIME WARNER CENTER - LOBBY - MORNING

           Absolute chaos.  Gunfire flying in all directions.  

           INSIDE THE SQUAD CAR

           David’s out cold.  Stirs awake behind the air bag.  Spots 
           Sonny pinned between the hood and the wall.  Finally dead.   

           David turns to check on Irene but she’s gone.  

           IN THE LOBBY 

           Ben's got his hands full, trading blows with two thugs as --

           Vin pulls Irene toward the stairs... A HAND grabs his 
           shoulder.  David.  He takes Vin down with a solid right hook.

                                 DAVID 
                        Didn’t anyone ever teach you not to 
                        touch another man’s wife?

           ACROSS THE LOBBY Coop grabs Andie as a hostage.  

                                 ANDIE
                        Ben!
           Coop meets Ben's eye but then shifts his glance to 

           David, taking Irene in his arms, ready for the big kiss:

                                 DAVID
                        How’s this for spontaneous?

                                 BEN
                        Dad!

           Coop drops David with a single shot and pulls Andie through a 
           back exit, disappearing into the crowded street. 

           Ben rushes to David’s side.  Blood everywhere.

                                 DAVID
                        I seem to be bleeding.  

                                 IRENE
                             (distraught)
                        Oh, he told you to wait in the car.

                                 BEN
                        Ollie!

           Ollie crouches by David, quickly slips into doctor mode.  

                                 OLLIE
                        I’ve got him.  Go.  

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE - DAY

           Throngs of NEW YORKERS crowd the sidewalk, jostling for the 
           best view of the passing floats and balloons.  

           Coop presses the gun to Andie’s side as they pass some COPS.  

                                 COOP
                        Don’t force me to make a mess.  

           The cops respond to a radio call from their patrol car.

                                 NYPD DISPATCHER (O.S.)
                        All units be advised...

           Ben weaves through the crowd, searching for Coop and Andie. 

           The cops approach Coop, hands on their weapons.

                                 COP #1
                        Sir, do you mind stepping over--
           Andie pulls away from Coop.   He grabs her wrists but she 
           uses the move from the motel, floors him just like Ollie.

           Before the cops can even draw their guns Coop’s back on his 
           feet, taking them down.  The crowd starts to panic.  

           Ben jumps onto the hood of a cab, pissing off the ANGRY 
           CABBIE.  He spots Coop moving through the parade itself. 

           Ben takes off after him, racing through a band of PILGRIMS...  

           Pushes through a HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND, losing sight of 
           Coop through all the bodies and instruments...  

                                 BEN
                        Shit.  

           He makes his way to a TURKEY FLOAT, spots Dryer and AGENTS 
           pushing through the crowd at the intersection ahead when --

           COOP dives off the float, tackling Ben to the pavement.  Ben 
           watches his gun get kicked away by PASSING PARADE MARCHERS.   

           Ben knocks away Coop’s gun and the two face off hand-to-hand.  
           Each throwing everything he’s got.  Two pros going at it.    

           PARADE MEMBERS scatter as Ben and Coop roll -- 

           UNDER THE CHARLIE BROWN BALLOON  

           The balloon climbs as the HUMAN ANCHORS ditch their posts.  

           Coop’s got Ben pinned, grabs his gun, but Ben grabs his 
           wrist.  Coop leans in, working the gun closer to Ben's face.  
           Ben's gun is just out of reach.  

           ON BEN, looking up at Coop, realizing this might be the end: 

                                 BEN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Ten years on the job, spent a lot 
                        of time thinking how I’d go out.        
                        Gotta admit staring up at Charlie 
                        Brown never crossed my mind.

                                 COOP
                        How bout it kid?  Any last words? 

           Ben's eyes light up as he spots the abandoned ANCHOR ROPE 
           dangling just over Coop’s shoulder. 

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        See that look?  That’s what the 
                        Greeks called an epiphany.  
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Yeah.  I quit.  

           Ben clips the ANCHOR ROPE to Coop’s belt -- the balloon JERKS 
           COOP UP.  Ben rolls for his gun, Coop raises his and -- BANG! 
           Ben takes Coop down just in the nick of time.   

           NYPD TEAMS converge on Ben, weapons drawn.

                                 NYPD TEAMS
                        Drop the gun! 

           Dryer pushes his way in front of them.  

                                 DRYER
                        It’s alright.  He’s with us.

           Exhausted, Ben lets his gun drop to the ground.  Collapses.  

           EXT. TIME WARNER CENTER - COLUMBUS CIRCLE - DAY

           EMERGENCY VEHICLES crowd the street, surrounded by hundreds 
           of CURIOUS NEW YORKERS, eager to get a view of the action.  

           AGENTS escort Vin, cuffed and humbled, to a GOVERNMENT SUV.

           As we TRACK ACROSS Patterson briefing the PRESS:

                                 PATTERSON
                        Thanks to the work of a government 
                        asset, working undercover to 
                        penetrate the Ajito organization...

           WE FIND a BEAUTIFUL PARAMEDIC examining Leonard.

                                 LEONARD
                        Has anyone ever told you that you 
                        look like a young Natalie Wood?

           AND FINALLY SETTLE ON Andie and Ben in the back of an 
           ambulance getting fixed up as Dryer argues with White.  

                                 WHITE
                        Immunity?  You can’t be serious?  

                                 DRYER
                        What do you say we talk about it 
                        over dinner?   

           White fixes on Ben with everything she’s got.
                                 WHITE
                        Any deal’s contingent on you giving 
                        me everything you’ve got.     

                                 BEN
                        Not a problem.

                                 WHITE
                        My office.  0800.  Tomorrow.  
                             (then to Dryer)
                        I like Thai food.

                                 DRYER
                        Yes ma’am.   

           White returns to barking orders at her men.

           The crowd parts for David’s stretcher, Irene buzzing by its 
           side.  Ollie’s in doctor mode, briefing the PARAMEDICS.   

                                 OLLIE
                        Breathing’s regular.  Pulse is 
                        tachycardic to the 120s.  

           The paramedics get ready to lift David into the ambulance.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, here we go.  Ben.

           David motions Ben to come closer.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You did good, kiddo.  

           David lays a gentle kiss on Ben's forehead.  

                                 PARAMEDIC
                        Sir.

           Ben backs away, eyes moist.  CLICK.  Irene snaps a photo. 

                                 IRENE
                        You’ll thank me later.  

           A PARAMEDIC blocks Irene from following David’s stretcher.  

                                 PARAMEDIC
                        Ma’am, you can ride up front if 
                        you’d like.
                                 IRENE
                        Dear, if you think you’re going to 
                        stop me from riding with my 
                        husband, you’re out of your God 
                        damn mind.   

           Irene smiles, warmly.  The paramedic steps aside and Irene 
           takes a seat next to David, lacing her fingers through his. 

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        Wipe that smile off your face.  
                        You’re still on the couch.

           Irene gives David a kiss as the ambulance doors slam shut.  

                                 OLLIE
                        I’ll ride up front, make sure he 
                        doesn’t get lost in the shuffle.

                                 BEN
                        We’ll meet you over there.  

           Ollie jumps in the front and the ambulance takes off.  

           Andie wraps her arms around Ben and as they start to kiss we 
           CRANE UP, taking stock of the chaos this family has sewn:  
           the sirens, demolished building and a crashed squad car. 

                                 ANDIE
                        So, I was thinking.  What are you 
                        guys doing for Christmas?  

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
