          WME - Theresa Kang, Elia Infascelli, Simon Faber
          UNDERGROUND - Oly Obst
           EXT. HOUSTON ST. - MORNING

           JASON, 28, charming and handsome in jeans and a solid color 
           vintage t-shirt, rides in the back of a taxi. His face is 
           reflected in the window as it pulls to the curb. Outside, a 
           sharply dressed Woman embraces a Man.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        Everyone wants a love story. 
                        Everyone.

           He gets out, shuts the door. 

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        That implausible story that makes 
                        old people cry and mothers clap.

           INT. HOUSE

           An OLDER WOMAN stares at us.

                                 WOMAN
                        How did you two meet?

           ANGLE ON: A young couple. They smile at each other.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Well, it was pouring rain in the 
                        city and we jumped into both sides 
                        of the same cab. At the same time.

           Older Woman wipes tears as a Mother furiously claps.

           EXT. JASON’S APARTMENT BUILDING

           Jason walks up to a typical Lower East Side building.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        Everyone wants someone to hang out 
                        with on a Sunday night - even when 
                        no one else will.

           INT. JASON’S BEDROOM

           Jason walks in and chucks his jacket on his bed - a mattress 
           that SITS ON THE FLOOR. 
                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        Everyone wants someone to make 
                        plans with, to hop online with and 
                        look at exotic places - for exotic 
                        vacations that have no chance of 
                        happening. 

           He hits his computer, the EXOTIC BEACH screensaver 
           disappears.

                                 JASON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Everyone wants someone to help them 
                        stick to their diet.

           ANGLE ON a makeshift BAR set up on his bedside table. 

                                 JASON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Someone who knows everything about 
                        them. And still loves them.

           Jason makes a drink next to a digital clock that reads, 9AM. 

           INT. JASON’S LIVING ROOM

           Jason pins the corner of his unframed 80’s CAROL ALT poster - 
           then sits on the couch. He grabs his Xbox controller.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        Someone to go to museums with. To 
                        cook dinners with. To watch movies 
                        with. In bed.

           He takes a sip.

                                 JASON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Everyone wants to get to know a 
                        whole new group of friends they’d 
                        never, ever, choose to be friends 
                        with on their own.

           Another sip.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Everyone wants joint bank accounts, 
                        collections of Bed, Bath and Beyond 
                        coupons, and expensive weddings 
                        where they can’t even talk to their 
                        friends. Intimacy, co-dependence, 
                        minivans, suburbs, and-

           Jason’s PHONE RINGS. He looks at it, realizes-
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck me.

           He jumps up, opens the window. Traffic sounds come pouring 
           in. 

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Hey! No, I didn’t forget. I’m on 
                        the way. 

           He holds the phone out the window, then back to his face.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Are you kidding? I left like 
                        fifteen minutes ago. Be there soon.

           He hangs up, sits back on the couch, continues playing his 
           video game.

                                 JASON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Like I said, everyone wants a love 
                        story.

           He takes a long pull off his drink. Ice clinks against glass.

                                 JASON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Everyone except me.

           INT. GIRL’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Close on A GIRL’S MOUTH. It begins moving as we pull back to 
           reveal CHRISTY, 24, sitting on the bed across from Jason.

                                 CHRISTY
                        You’re selfish. You’re arrogant. 
                        You’re distant and emotionally 
                        retarded. You make jokes to avoid 
                        any serious issues and here’s the 
                        thing, I think I love you.

                                 JASON
                        Your capacity to love is 
                        spectacular. That’s what I love 
                        about you-

                                 CHRISTY
                        So...where is this going, then?  

           Jason looks her dead in the eyes.
                                 JASON
                        You know I’m not really ready to 
                        jump into something serious right 
                        now-

                                 CHRISTY
                        -I’m breaking up with you. I have 
                        to.

                                 JASON
                        Breaking up?

           Jason seems caught off guard. And then something we don’t 
           expect begins to happen. Jason begins to cry.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I’m so sorry. It’s just, I need a 
                        guy who’s ready. Someone ambitious, 
                        serious. Someone with...a bed 
                        frame.

           Jason gets up off and walks to the door.

                                 JASON
                        I want you to know that I care 
                        about you. I think you’re an 
                        amazing, talented, and beautiful 
                        person. And you will find someone 
                        that will make you unbelievably 
                        happy. But it’s not our time.

           Christy starts crying hard, genuinely moved. Jason slips out.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

           Jason bursts out the door. His friend MIKEY, 28, good looking 
           and a little uptight, is leaning against the wall smoking a 
           cigarette. He’s wearing scrubs.

                                 JASON
                        Mikey! Sorry I’m late.

           They start walking down the street.

                                 MIKEY
                        Always. I’m always waiting for you. 
                        And the thing is Jason, I’m way 
                        busier than you. Have you been 
                        crying?

                                 JASON
                        Frankly, Mikey, I just got dumped. 
                                 MIKEY
                        Dumped? I didn’t even know you two 
                        were officially dating.

           Jason stops and looks at Mikey, perhaps recalling the times 
           he and Christy shared together. Then he smiles.

                                 JASON
                        Neither did I.

           Mikey shakes his head.

                                 MIKEY
                        She give you the “so?”

                                 JASON
                        I got the “so.”

           BLACK.

           TITLES: OVER VARIOUS SHOTS OF NYC

           EXT. CAFE GITANE - MORNING

           Mikey and Jason grab a coffee outside the cafe on Mott St. A 
           beautiful corner in an even more beautiful city. 

                                 MIKEY
                        Why’d she think you were dating?

                                 JASON
                        No idea. I mean, we had sex twice a 
                        week for two months.

                                 MIKEY
                        That could have been it. 

                                 JASON
                        That’s not dating. That’s a hook 
                        up, approaching the seeing stage. 
                        Two more weeks and it could have 
                        been dating, but I never let it get 
                        there with the overly emotional 
                        set.

                                 MIKEY
                        So what’s with the waterworks? 

                                 JASON
                        It made her feel like she had a 
                        genuine experience. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JASON (CONT'D)
                        That’s important to girls. It helps 
                        them get over you faster.

           Mikey shakes his head.

                                 MIKEY
                        It’s been what, five years since 
                        Jenny? When’s this gonna end?

                                 JASON
                        End? I’m not at a place in my life 
                        to have a serious relationship. 

                                 MIKEY
                        Place in your life? That’s what you 
                        say when you don’t want a puppy. 

                                 JASON
                        The key for me right now is to stay 
                        in that ambiguous spot between the 
                        initial hook up, and when you start 
                        officially dating. That’s my area.

           He pauses.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I am a human grey area.

           INT. MEDIAWORKS - DAY

           Jason is sitting at a computer in a room full of computer 
           screens at a graphic design house. 

                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                        You read this article in New York 
                        Magazine?

           DANIEL, 28, taller and slim, with slight scruff, chucks him a 
           magazine.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        Daniel has been my friend since day 
                        one, college. He’s easily excited.

                                 DANIEL
                        Apparently, most of the bars on the 
                        east side are filled with hookers. 

                                 JASON
                        The thing I admire about you is you 
                        believe everything you read. It’s 
                        like you’re a nine year old.
                                 DANIEL
                        No, like young, cool hookers. They 
                        look just like hipsters and shit.

           Jason open up the magazine. Quotes...

                                 JASON
                        She dresses like any other pretty 
                        young thing, knee high boots strewn 
                        about the floor, a college 
                        psychology textbook perched on the 
                        bedside table. And just below, a 
                        drawer filled to the hilt with 
                        condoms seems the only indication 
                        of her sideline occupation. That’s 
                        awesome.

           Their boss, FRED, 40, a guy that wears suspenders just 
           because, interrupts.

                                 FRED
                        Hey guys...it’s Fred.

                                 JASON
                        Hey Fred. You know it’s not a phone 
                        right? You’re actually here.

                                 DANIEL
                        We can see you.

                                 FRED
                        Right. Well, we got a work order on 
                        the new Amanda Silverman book, The 
                        Husband Shopper. We’re in there on 
                        Tuesday. You guys ready? 

           Daniel stands and grabs his coffee.

           INT. MEDIAWORKS - CONFERENCE ROOM

           A medium size conference table in a glass inclosed room. A 
           couple of poster sized mock ups sit on easels. Jason and Fred 
           watch as Daniel pitches his book cover designs.

                                 DANIEL
                        And that’s why we thought something 
                        bright, clean...pink...would work. 

           Daniel turns over his last mock up. Professional, but pretty 
           standard, summer novel cover. The Accidental Princess. The 
           looks on the faces around the room say it all - not 
           impressed. 
           Jason gets up. Grabs a black sharpie.

                                 JASON
                        And if you look at these, you’ll 
                        see exactly what you’d get 
                        everywhere else. Daniel and I know 
                        that - we’ve discussed it at 
                        length.

           Daniel clearly has no idea what Jason is talking about, but 
           he goes with it.

                                 DANIEL
                        And if that’s what you want, we can 
                        deliver. But when your book drowns 
                        in a sea of boring pastel....

           He grabs one of the mock ups. Flips it over to the blank, 
           white side. 

                                 JASON
                        Here’s what you want. Black and 
                        white. Cool. Spare. Should look 
                        like art you’d actually hang - at 
                        least in your bathroom.

           Smiles all around as Jason writes The Accidental Princess in 
           bold, embellished cursive at the top.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        A book’s cover should hint at the 
                        story, but not give too much away. 
                        This is a story about wish 
                        fulfillment.

           He draws a antique perfume bottle.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        A recent study using MRIs showed 
                        that women’s brains looked like 
                        fireworks when you showed them 
                        pictures of...

           He queries the meeting with a glance.

                                 GUY IN A SUIT
                        Brad Pitt?

                                 JASON
                        Close. Shoes.

           Laughter. And he draws a pair of heels materializing out of 
           the smoke of the bottle.
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        So nothing says wish fulfillment 
                        like Christian Louboutin. Ask any 
                        girl in this room.

           Jason caps his sharpie, punctuating his point. A SHARPLY 
           DRESSED WOMAN stands.

                                 SHARPLY DRESSED WOMAN
                        I love it. You’ve clearly taken the 
                        time to read the book. And your 
                        theatrics are much appreciated. 

           Jason nods. Fred smiles. Daniel looks relieved. 

                                 SHARPLY DRESSED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        If people judge this book by it’s 
                        cover, we might just have a 
                        bestseller.

           She breaks into a satisfied grin. 

                                 JASON
                        If this book wasn’t one of the 
                        world’s most unimaginative, vapid 
                        pieces of culturally destructive 
                        bullshit, you might just have a 
                        classic.

           The Woman is stunned.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

           Daniel and Jason are out of work, walking to the subway.

                                 DANIEL
                        You just sabotaged your promotion.

                                 JASON
                        The further you get along in life, 
                        the more people expect from you. 
                        You get promoted, people think you 
                        need a relationship. You get a 
                        relationship, you need to get 
                        married. Get married, and you 
                        suddenly need a kid. I don’t even 
                        know what I want to do with my 
                        life. But I know it isn’t this.

                                 DANIEL
                        Well, thanks again for saving my 
                        ass. 
                                 JASON
                        It’s not the time to be looking for 
                        another job, and you know this 
                        stuff’s easy for me.

                                 DANIEL
                        At least let me buy you a drink.

                                 JASON
                        Forget the drink, just give me a 
                        handjob right now and we’re good. 
                        Dead serious. Right now.

           Daniel smiles. These guys are really close. Not close enough 
           for a handjob, but still.

                                 DANIEL
                        We’re going out tonight. Pregame, 
                        your apartment.

           INT. JASON’S LIVINGROOM - LATER

           Jason is watching Dr. Phil on TV. Drink in hand.

                                 DR. PHIL
                        The success of any relationship is 
                        the function by which it meets the 
                        needs of both people.

                                 JASON
                        Hey, are you taking a shit in 
                        there?

                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                        Absolutely not. 

           IN THE BATHROOM Daniel is putting lotion on his face. 
           Intercut.

                                 JASON
                        I swear every time you come over to 
                        my apartment you take a shit. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m not taking a shit. Jesus. I’m 
                        putting on self tanner.

           Daniel is actually on the toilet.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        And taking a shit.
                                 JASON
                        Why are you putting tanner on?

                                 DANIEL
                        I told that assistant from Vogue I 
                        couldn’t hang out because I was in 
                        St. Barth’s. I’m trying to phase 
                        her out of my roster. 

           Daniel stands up and puts the tanning lotion in Jason’s 
           bathroom cabinet as Mikey comes home, excited.

                                 MIKEY
                        I’m ready to get back in the game!

           INT. MIKEY’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK

           Mikey is sitting on his couch in his scrubs across from VERA 
           his put together wife, and a QUIET MAN.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        Mikey had recently received some 
                        news that could be construed as 
                        unfavorable.

                                 VERA
                        I’ve been having intense sex with 
                        Harold for two months.

                                 MIKEY
                        Sex?!

                                 VERA
                        Intense sex. With Harold. Not that 
                        it’s any of your business. 

                                 MIKEY
                        You’re my wife. So it kind of is.

                                 VERA
                        Mikey, I’d like a divorce.

                                 MIKEY
                        Who the hell is Harold?

                                 VERA
                        My lawyer here will make sure this 
                        all goes smoothly.

           Vera puts her hand on The Quiet Man’s shoulder. He half 
           smiles. Mikey is almost choking.
                                 MIKEY
                        G-g-goes smoothly? This is your 
                        lawyer?

                                 VERA
                        Yes. 
                        (beat)
                        He’s also Harold.

                                 HAROLD
                        Hey...you have cool shoes.

                                 VERA
                        He’s actually a very good lawyer.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Mikey and Jason, and Daniel are playing Modern Warfare 2. 
           Yelling. Beers are around.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        That was two months ago. Mikey and 
                        I have been living together ever 
                        since.

           The guys react to a video game killing. Mikey’s got a huge 
           grin on his face as he jumps up.

                                 MIKEY
                        You know what? I don’t care if I 
                        died. I love this. I miss this. 
                        I’ve been out of the game so long, 
                        I didn’t realize how much I miss 
                        hanging out with you guys. 

                                 DANIEL
                        You were never in the game. You 
                        were a married doctor. The only 
                        place that’s sexy is on tv.

                                 JASON
                        But it’s good to have you back.

                                 MIKEY
                        I didn’t think I’d get to feel this 
                        pre-going out thing again. The 
                        excitement. The energy. This is 
                        what you miss in relationships. 
           EXT. JASON’S APARTMENT

           The guys spill out of the front door.

                                 DANIEL
                        And as a little motivator. Open up. 
                        Don’t ask questions.

           He pops a pill into each of their mouths.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Viagra. You now have four hours to 
                        drink like a homeless dude and 
                        still get hard.

                                 MIKEY
                        How do you know I don’t have a 
                        heart condition?

                                 DANIEL
                        Because I’ve known you my whole 
                        life. And I don’t care.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT - LATER

           *Daniel and a Hot Girl talk. Jason walks up.

                                 JASON
                        He’s terrible in the sack. 
                        Absolutely god awful.

           Daniel and Jason share a glance. The guys have clearly done 
           this before.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        But he’s widely recognized as one 
                        of the best kissers in the world.

           *Mikey sits alone at the bar, drinking.  Jason comes over.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        You’re doing great.

                                 MIKEY
                        I’m drinking alone in a bar full of 
                        assholes. And the worst part is, 
                        the girls seem to like the assholes 
                        more.

                                 JASON
                        Try not to look nervous. 
                                 MIKEY
                        This is the way I’ve looked for my 
                        entire life. And that girl’s 
                        looking at you.

                                 JASON
                        I doubt it. She’s beautiful.

                                 MIKEY
                        Why would a girl like that be into 
                        you? She’s way too hot.

           We see ELLIE. Dark Hair. Light eyes. Fair skin. She’s at the 
           other end of the bar. Mikey casually fixes his hair.

                                 JASON
                        Look at me for a sec. Does it look 
                        like I play guitar?

                                 MIKEY
                        Not really, no. 

                                 JASON
                        Good. It’ll surprise her when I 
                        pretend I do.

           *Jason casually sidles up to the bar, next to Ellie.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I’m pretty tired, so if you just 
                        want to get outta here I’d be down.

                                 ELLIE
                        Tell me that works.

                                 JASON
                        Not once.

           *Mikey is still getting drunk, alone at the bar. A put 
           together young woman with Glasses, sits down next to Mikey. 
           Mikey looks at his wedding ring. So does she.

                                 GLASSES
                        A night away from the old lady?

                                 MIKEY
                        Yeah. We, uh, separated. She was 
                        fucking Harold.

           *Daniel is telling the girl a story.
                                 DANIEL
                        Well, when I was a kid, I used to 
                        open all the windows in my bedroom 
                        when it was freezing, and then lay 
                        on top of the covers.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        Why?

                                 DANIEL
                        Just so I would understand what it 
                        felt like to be homeless. I needed 
                        to understand. Do you understand 
                        that feeling? Just needing to know?

                                 HOT GIRL
                        You’re like the most compassionate 
                        guy in New York.

           She hugs him. Daniel just shakes his head. Too easy.

           *Jason is talking to Ellie. He puts his blackberry on the 
           bar. She glares at it.

                                 JASON
                        Oh don’t tell me you’re a 
                        blackberry etiquette person. 

                                 ELLIE
                        It’s a little rude.

                                 JASON
                        I have a disorder of some sort. If 
                        that little red light goes off, 
                        I’ll think about it and think about 
                        it and drive myself crazy until I 
                        can check it.

                                 ELLIE
                        I have that same thing!

           She takes her phone out.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m just always scared people think 
                        it’s rude. Apparently you don’t 
                        have that problem.

                                 JASON
                        Nope. I lay all my bad qualities on 
                        the table, first date. Avoids 
                        complications later.
                                 ELLIE
                        This what you’d call a date?

                                 JASON
                        No. I’d call this my longest 
                        relationship. We should probably 
                        have sex so we can start hating 
                        each other.

           Ellie laughs. Then gets funny/serious.

                                 ELLIE
                        I haven’t been known to have sex on 
                        the first date, Jason.

                                 JASON
                        I haven’t been known to have sex 
                        well on the first date. Or most 
                        dates thereafter. In fact, for a 
                        mediocre sexual experience, I’m 
                        your guy.

           She laughs.

           *Daniel is making out with the Hot Girl.

           *Mikey is still sitting with Glasses Girl.

                                 GLASSES
                        There’s always a Harold.

                                 MIKEY
                        Apparently he’s a very good lawyer.

           Glasses hands him his phone.

                                 GLASSES
                        I put my number in your phone. Use 
                        it when you’re ready. Also, you’re 
                        sitting on my coat.

           Mikey gets up. And hands her the coat.

           EXT. BAR

           Mikey and Jason talk outside the bar. Ellie waits in a cab. 
           Daniel comes over.

                                 JASON
                        I’m out. How’d we do?
                                 DANIEL
                        I Bravehearted. Hook, line and 
                        sinker. 

           Mikey is kind of drunk.

                                 MIKEY
                        What’s a Braveheart?

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s when I tell a story to sound 
                        like a good person. It’s too 
                        advanced for you. 

                                 MIKEY
                        Yeah, well...I got a phone number. 

                                 JASON
                        See? Mikey’s making progress...

                                 DANIEL
                        Progress? When’s the last time you 
                        had sex with a phone number?

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM

           Mikey is furiously masturbating to the phone number.

                                 MIKEY
                        Yeah, I am sitting on your coat. 
                        How do you like that??

           INT. ELLIE’S APARTMENT

           Ellie walks Jason into Ellie’s apartment. They’re clearly a 
           little drunk. Jason opens a door to the bathroom, which is in 
           the kitchen.

                                 JASON
                        Your bathroom’s in the kitchen.

                                 ELLIE
                        I know. It’s very confusing for the 
                        bathroom.

                                 JASON
                        Someone, at some point, decided 
                        this was the best possible 
                        location. 
                                 ELLIE
                        It’s certainly efficient. 

                                 JASON
                        Hey, Jim, yeah. It’s Frankie. Let’s 
                        move forward with the bathroom 
                        right where people cook. Just in 
                        case they need to take a shit and 
                        bake a cake at the same time.

           INT. ELLIE’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Jason and Ellie are at each other in the aggressive way that 
           first hookups tend to be. It’s a mixture of excitement, 
           discovery, and fun. 

           They slowly slip into a rhythm, and before long, we see 
           crumpled, hastily removed clothes hit the floor.

           LATER

           Jason has just finished having sex with Ellie. She snuggles 
           up next to him.

                                 JASON
                        Most fun you can have for free.

                                 ELLIE
                        Nothing’s free, Jason. Isn’t that 
                        what they say?

                                 JASON
                        Well then enjoy that STD I just 
                        gave you. You have no idea what I 
                        went through to get it.

           She hits him, playfully. Laughing.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I have to use your bathroom 
                        kitchen.

           As Jason walks out he sees a drawer FULL of condoms next to 
           the bed. Then he sees her KNEE HIGH BOOTS on the floor. 

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        Nothing’s free Jason.

           Then he sees the New York Magazine with the East Village 
           hookers article. He dials on his phone.
           INT. DANIEL’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM

           Daniel is naked, in his bathroom, talking to Jason. They 
           WHISPER YELL at each other. 

                                 JASON
                        Dude! I’ve got a problem.

                                 DANIEL
                        You have a problem? I have to take 
                        a leak, and my boner looks like the 
                        thing on the Price is Right. 

           Beat.

                                 JASON
                        Bob Barker?

                                 DANIEL
                        No! Asshole. The thing that stops 
                        the wheel. I think I took too much 
                        of that stuff and I really gotta 
                        go.

                                 JASON
                        You’re gonna have to get 
                        horizontal.

                                 DANIEL
                        What? 

           He cradles the phone with his neck, and puts his arms on the 
           back of the toilet. He swings his legs, one by one, onto the 
           sink, so he’s now horizontal - looming over the toilet like a 
           gymnast. He starts to take a leak.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        It’s working! It’s working. We’ve 
                        achieved urination. How do you 
                        think of this stuff?

                                 JASON
                        Just a hunch.

           We PULL back on Jason and he’s in the EXACT SAME POSITION.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        But dude, I think the girl I just 
                        had sex with is a hooker.

                                 DANIEL
                        What? That’s awesome! 
                                 JASON
                        Not awesome. What if I have to pay 
                        her? I don’t have hooker money.

           Jason begins to panic.

                                 DANIEL
                        Who has hooker money?

                                 JASON
                        Not me. You gotta help me, man. 
                        What do I do? 

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know. If she asks for cash, 
                        you could pretend you’re a hooker 
                        too. Hope the rates equal out.

                                 JASON
                        That’s not helping, dude.

           Daniel is now shaking, laughing.

                                 DANIEL
                        Though you’re not exactly in great 
                        shape, so I suspect she’d command a 
                        higher price. 

                                 JASON
                        You’re totally fucking useless, you 
                        know that? 

           Daniel is still holding himself horizontal and still taking a 
           leak as he drops his phone in the toilet. The call ends. 

           He turns and sees the Hot Girl from the bar staring at him. A 
           LONG BEAT passes.

                                 DANIEL
                        Whatever you think is happening 
                        right now, is actually happening.

           INT. ELLIE’S APARTMENT

           Jason sees Ellie is napping. He gets on his hands and knees, 
           and starts crawling towards his clothes. He grabs his pants, 
           shoes. She MOVES.

           And she doesn’t wake up. Jason backs out of the room, silent.

                                 MIKEY (V.O.)
                        Who uses self tanner?!
           EXT. JASON’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Mikey stands there holding the tanner as Daniel and Jason are 
           drinking coffee.

                                 DANIEL
                        Me. Why?

                                 MIKEY
                        Because I beat off with it last 
                        night.

           Daniel and Jason spit out their coffee and start laughing.

                                 DANIEL
                        Why didn’t you read the bottle?

                                 MIKEY
                        The heat of the moment! Look at 
                        this.

           He opens his towel so the guys can see. They ad-lib 
           Ohh/C’mon, etc...

           Beat.

                                 JASON
                        Your dick looks like a yam.

                                 DANIEL
                        Your dick looks like a candy corn.

                                 MIKEY
                        Stop.

                                 JASON
                        If your dick was wearing a tuxedo, 
                        it would look exactly like George 
                        Hamilton.

           INSERT: just what you thought you’d never see, an orange 
           COCK.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Your dick looks like a Baltimore 
                        Oriole.

                                 MIKEY
                        What happened to you two idiots 
                        last night?
           EXT. EXTRA VIRGIN - WEST VILLAGE

           Jason, Daniel and Mikey are having brunch. 

                                 MIKEY
                        That’s her livelihood. You 
                        basically robbed this poor hooker. 

                                 JASON
                        I didn’t rob her. 

                                 DANIEL
                        You robbed a hooker. You should 
                        notify your parents of this 
                        accomplishment in case they need to 
                        brag to their friends.

                                 JASON
                        The thing is, everything else was 
                        great. She was smart, funny. 

                                 DANIEL
                        She’s a professional, dude. She’s 
                        trained in the art of making you 
                        like her. With her vagina.

                                 MIKEY
                        Jesus.

                                 JASON
                        That’s the kind of girl I would 
                        date if I was ready to get serious. 
                        And if she happened to not, you 
                        know, fuck other people for money.

                                 DANIEL
                        If you dated her, I wonder if you 
                        could get a monthly membership or 
                        something. Like a gym.

                                 MIKEY
                        Maybe your insurance would cover 
                        it.

                                 JASON
                        I’m 28 dude. You think I have 
                        insurance?
           INT. BLACK AND WHITE BAR - 10TH ST

           Daniel is at the bar drinking as CHELSEA WALL, a cute 
           brunette dressed upmarket down, comes flying in.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Sorry, sorry, sorry. The auction 
                        went late. Gin please. Tonic.

                                 DANIEL
                        Well, Sotheby’s can buy my drinks 
                        for keeping you.

                                 CHELSEA
                        And my father was there. He kept 
                        buying things. It was so 
                        embarrassing.

                                 DANIEL
                        More embarrassing than being poor?

                                 CHELSEA
                        Shut the fuck up. How was your 
                        date?

                                 DANIEL
                        She was very sweet, well read, and 
                        gave me perhaps the best blowjob in 
                        recorded history. 

                                 CHELSEA
                        Ugh. Every blowjob you get is the 
                        best in recorded history.

                                 DANIEL
                        Well, if you look for the only 
                        common variable across all 
                        encounters, you’ll find it’s me. So 
                        maybe I’m the best in recorded 
                        history at receiving blowjobs.

           They’re both grinning. At their comfort level, it’s obvious 
           they’ve been best friends for years.

                                 CHELSEA
                        You’re my best friend, but you 
                        might be the worst person in the 
                        entire world. 

           An ATTRACTIVE BLONDE girl is walking by. Chelsea clocks her.
                                 CHELSEA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god. I love your boots! I’ve 
                        been looking for those.

                                 ATTRACTIVE BLONDE
                        Oh thank you!

                                 CHELSEA
                        This is my friend Daniel - recently 
                        voted the best person in the entire 
                        world.

                                 ATTRACTIVE BLONDE
                        Is that right?

                                 CHELSEA
                        But he’s a virgin. 

                                 ATTRACTIVE BLONDE
                        There’s always a catch.

           Daniel gives Chelsea a knowing look. They’ve done this many 
           times. Daniel sighs.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m just trying to get laid before 
                        I graduate high school.

           Attractive Blonde laughs. Got her.

                                 ATTRACTIVE BLONDE
                        I’m Sophie.

                                 DANIEL
                        Bartender! Tequila. (to Sophie) 
                        Just promise to go easy on me. I’m 
                        sensitive.

           Attractive Blonde drops her bag next to their perch at the 
           bar. 

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        (mouthing to Chelsea) Thank you.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

           The sun comes up. Beautiful NYC day. Crisp. Clear. Amazing.
           EXT. CEDAR SINAI - MORNING

           Mikey, in his scrubs, grabs a coffee from a cart outside. As 
           he turns to walk in, he bumps into Vera, his ex wife.

           Mikey goes into doctor/ex-husband mode.

                                 MIKEY
                        What’s wrong. Everything okay?

                                 VERA
                        I was just having some pain... 
                        Everything’s fine. It’s probably 
                        just a UTI.

           Something shifts in Mikey. 

                                 MIKEY
                        Have you been eating lots of carbs,  
                        or any other activity that may have 
                        caused irritation? Like, for 
                        example, aggressive sex - 

                                 VERA
                        Mikey...

           She looks at him. She’s coming from the hospital. Nervous.

                                 MIKEY
                        Sorry. That’s not...what I meant. 
                        I’ll take a look at your results. 
                        You’ll be okay Ver...I’m sure it’s 
                        nothing. 

                                 VERA
                        Can you drop by our...my place. I 
                        just have a box of stuff I think 
                        you’ll want.

           Mikey just stares.

           INSERT SIGN : SIMON AND SIMON PUBLISHING 

           The sign hangs in the lobby of a neatly appointed, large 
           office.
           INT. SIMON & SIMON - CONFERENCE ROOM

           We’re on AMANDA SILVERMAN, author. An Upper East Side woman 
           with an Upper East Side facelift, who’s Upper East Side 
           bitter at her Upper East side divorce.

                                 GIRL’S VOICE
                        I just don’t see why this all has 
                        to be so cynical. What happened to 
                        the effusive and beautiful love 
                        story?

                                 AMANDA
                        From where in the Mid-West did this 
                        one wash up?

                                 BOSS
                        Take it easy Amanda. She’s fresh 
                        off her masters from Chicago.

                                 AMANDA
                        In sentimentality?

           We reverse on the girl, it’s Ellie, looking quite put 
           together.

                                 ELLIE
                        Shouldn’t we leave people with some 
                        hope? It’s so bleak.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh please, welcome to New York. 
                        You’re young and pretty and the 
                        world is yours, but you’re nobody’s 
                        first wife yet.

                                 ELLIE
                        Okay. Then how about this: She 
                        shows up at the Guggenheim wearing 
                        this season’s Chanel and murders 
                        her ex husband?

           Amanda smiles.

                                 AMANDA
                        Now you’re thinking like a New 
                        Yorker.

           Ellie is still fuming as someone walks into the boardroom 
           carrying a large poster sized MOCK UP.

           CLOSE ON: THE BERGDORF’S HUSBAND SHOPPER
           A picture of a suit-clad, good looking guy peeking his head 
           out of a Bergdorf’s bag. Cursive writing. Pink background.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Now that is absolutely gorgeous.

           The poster is lowered and JASON IS STANDING THERE.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        And so is that.

           Ellie’s eyes narrow.

           INT. OFFICE - ADJACENT

           Drab. Stacks of manuscripts. Jason follows Ellie in, and she 
           turns to meet him. 

                                 JASON
                        I’m not defending my position. It’s 
                        just...all the signs were there.

                                 ELLIE
                        Signs?!

                                 JASON
                        There were signs. Hooker signs.

                                 ELLIE
                        Hooker signs? Enlighten me.

                                 JASON
                        Hooker boots. 

                                 ELLIE
                        They’re in style.

                                 JASON
                        Tons of condoms.

                                 ELLIE
                        You ever think they might be there 
                        because I’m NOT using them?

           She picks up the phone on the desk.

                                 JASON
                        Sex was amazing. 

                                 ELLIE
                        That’s not a hooker sign!
           Into the phone...

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Security? Yes, fifth floor.

           Covers the phone as Jason continues...

                                 JASON
                        And you were willing to hop into 
                        bed with me at the drop of a hat. 
                        Nobody has sex with anybody that 
                        easily. Especially me. Look at me.

           ...not breaking. Ellie moves to the door.

                                 ELLIE
                        I know you’re fantastic at leaving.

           She shows him the door, slams it behind him, and just like 
           that...

           INT. MEDIAWORKS

           Jason sits down next to Daniel, excited.

                                 JASON
                        She’s not a hooker.

           People look over.

                                 DANIEL
                        What?

                                 JASON
                        That girl, Ellie. She’s an editor. 
                        At Simon and Simon.

                                 DANIEL
                        That can’t have gone well...

                                 JASON
                        It went terribly. She hates me. But 
                        I’ll bring her around.

                                 DANIEL
                        Wow. Change of plans. You’re gonna 
                        try to date this girl?

                                 JASON
                        No. Course not. I just want to get 
                        her on the roster.
           Daniel nods.

                                 DANIEL
                        Although I liked her better as a 
                        hooker, I appreciate the challenge 
                        ahead of you.

           INT. VERA’S APARTMENT

           Vera stands in her doorway. We reverse on Mikey. Nervous.

                                 VERA
                        Thanks for coming by. 

           Mikey walks into the apartment, looks around. He takes in the 
           changes. A box of things - picture frames, a medical diploma, 
           etc, sits on the couch. The TV plays on mute.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        I put the rest of your stuff in 
                        that box.

                                 MIKEY
                        You moved the coat rack over. And 
                        that painting. You finally hung it 
                        up.

                                 VERA
                        I did. 

                                 MIKEY
                        Harold do it for you?

                                 VERA
                        Mikey...

                                 MIKEY
                        Sorry. That was my attempt to 
                        lighten the mood by using humor. 

           She smiles.

                                 VERA
                        You were never very funny. 

                                 MIKEY
                        Doctors don’t have to be funny.  
                        Patch Adams can suck my dick. 
                        That’s not what treating people is 
                        about.
                                 VERA
                        Of course, I found your unfunny-
                        ness...charming.

           Mikey picks up a picture from the box. The two of them. 
           Wedding day. Throws it back in.

                                 MIKEY
                        I should go.

                                 VERA
                        You hungry?

           LATER

           Mikey and Vera are eating Chinese on the floor, watching 
           Overboard - the Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn movie that’s always 
           on TV. 

                                 MIKEY
                        No way would she ever believe him. 
                        Amnesia doesn’t work that way. 
                        There would be environmental cues 
                        that she would pick up on.

                                 VERA
                        You know it’s not real, right? It’s 
                        not a documentary, Mikey. That’s 
                        Kurt Russell.

           Mikey laughs. He looks at Vera, perhaps for the first time 
           since they split.

           INT. JASON/MIKEY’S APARTMENT

           Mikey gets home and sets down his box of things. The light 
           from outside slakes in through the blinds as he grabs a beer 
           from the refrigerator, sits up on the counter.

           Jason, looking sleepy, comes out of his room in his boxers. 
           He sees the box, grabs a beer, and sits up on the counter 
           opposite Mikey.

                                 JASON
                        You want to know how I know you’re 
                        not okay?

                                 MIKEY
                        How?
                                 JASON
                        You’re Mikey. You’ve never been 
                        okay. Ever.

                                 MIKEY
                        Yo know what? Fuck Harold. Tonight 
                        reminded me of everything good 
                        about my marriage before Harold 
                        dipped his filthy penis, esquire, 
                        into my wife. 

           Jason goes to speak, then stops.

                                 JASON
                        Wait, did you just say, filthy 
                        penis, esquire?

                                 MIKEY
                        Yeah. Because he’s a lawyer. 

                                 JASON
                        No I get it. That wasn’t my issue.

                                 MIKEY
                        In the ER, there’s no middle 
                        ground. We can either resuscitate 
                        or...but with her...

           Jason sees his friend is hurting.

                                 JASON
                        Well Mikey, when you find the 
                        person you’re supposed to be with, 
                        the one who steals all your 
                        thoughts, the one you fall in love 
                        with...even if you’re you - and 
                        you’re not a fighter -  isn’t that 
                        worth fighting for? 

                                 MIKEY
                        Help me do this right, Jason. This 
                        is what you do.

           Jason thinks...decides...

                                 JASON
                        She can’t think it’s an invite to a 
                        date. You have to be careful here, 
                        but I’ll help you get her back.
           INT. SIMON AND SIMON BATHROOM 

           Ellie is washing her hands next to her boss.

                                 BOSS
                        I’m moving you off the Silverman 
                        book. 

                                 ELLIE
                        That’s a little unfair. 

                                 BOSS
                        I’m moving you to the Matterhorn 
                        team. Jack’s got a novel coming out-

                                 ELLIE
                        I’d prefer to stay on the Silverman 
                        book.

                                 BOSS
                        This isn’t a choice you get to 
                        make. Jack’s editor is practically 
                        a relic, and he needs someone like 
                        you to help him focus.

           The Boss finishes washing her hands.

           INT. ELLIE’S OFFICE - LATER

           An intern hands her an envelope. Ellie takes it without 
           looking up. She opens it and a drawing on a single sheet of 
           paper slides out.

           INSERT: A drawing of Ellie, as a superhero of some sort. 
           There is an “I” on her chest.

           QUICK CUTS:

           Of Ellie opening identical envelope after identical envelope. 
           And getting variation after variation of the pictures.

           INT ELLIE’S OFFICE - MORNING

           She’s lined up all the drawings. She thinks for a second, 
           then rearranges them.

           They letters on the superhero’s chest spell, “I’M SORRY.”
           INT. ELLIE’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON 

           She’s working when her office phone rings. She grabs it. 
           Intercut as necessary.

                                 JASON 
                        It’s Jason. Don’t hang up. 

           She lets it hang there.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        At least let me apologize... 

                                 ELLIE
                        Okay.

                                 JASON
                        ...for the sex the other night. Not 
                        for the hooker business. For the 
                        sex.

           She smiles, despite obviously not wanting to.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Did you like my drawings?

           INT. COFFEE SHOP

           Jason comes over with two coffees and sits down with Ellie. 
           They stare at each other.

                                 ELLIE
                        It’s actually kind of funny.

           Jason exhales, relieved.

                                 JASON
                        Oh thank god. Simple 
                        misunderstanding.

                                 ELLIE
                        What kind of girl would I be if I 
                        didn’t eventually find it funny? 

                                 JASON
                        You’d be every other girl in the 
                        world.
           EXT. CAFE

           We see them get into a little rhythm.

           BACK INSIDE

                                 JASON
                        It’s one of those jobs you get as a 
                        stepping stone, and you never 
                        leave.

                                 ELLIE
                        But at least you’re using your 
                        talent. Creating a book’s cover-

                                 JASON
                        I literally ask people to do the 
                        one thing your parents taught you 
                        not to. 

                                 ELLIE
                        To judge a book by it’s cover... 

                                 JASON
                        That and fuck a much older dude in 
                        a windowless van. But yeah.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh no! Were we not supposed to do 
                        that?

           Jason grins. She’s right with him, every step...

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Although I’d take the windowless 
                        van guy over most guys these days. 
                        Least that pervert knows what he 
                        wants.

                                 JASON
                        Wow. Who was he?

                                 ELLIE
                        Who?

                                 JASON
                        The guy that destroyed you?

           She smiles. Busted, perhaps.
           INT. 10TH ST. RUSSIAN BATHS - SAME

           We’re in the classic NYC baths. Tiled, hot, with a big oven 
           and a dunking pool. It’s not nice in here, it’s functional. A 
           Russian Guy violently pounds Eucalyptus leaves against 
           another Russian guy’s back. 

           Daniel sits in the corner across from Chelsea. She’s in towel 
           up to her chest. He’s in swim trunks. They’re sweating. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I told her I wasn’t looking for 
                        anything super serious.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Anything super serious...after you 
                        had sex, of course.

                                 DANIEL
                        It seemed like the appropriate 
                        time.

                                 CHELSEA
                        You wouldn’t want her to get the 
                        wrong idea. Want to date you.

           He touches her arm, sarcastically.

                                 DANIEL
                        You understand me.

                                 CHELSEA
                        I hope I never have a daughter 
                        because of you. How does that make 
                        you feel? You killed my daughter 
                        from the future.

           An Fat Russian guy wedges in next to Daniel. There’s an 
           entire bath full of open seats.

                                 DANIEL
                        Awesome. Hi. That’s the seat huh?

           Fat Russian doesn’t answer. Probably doesn’t speak English. 
           Chelsea giggles. Daniel gets up and moves to the other side 
           of Chelsea. 

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        And the sex was incredible.
                                 CHELSEA
                        Ugh, don’t tell me. I haven’t had 
                        sex in five months.

                                 DANIEL
                        Five months? I can’t believe that. 
                        You’re beautiful, smart, you’ve got 

           Chelsea lowers her towel, revealing...

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        ...amazing tits! Jesus Christ, 
                        Chels. When did those show up to 
                        the party?

                                 CHELSEA
                        I went on the pill when I was with 
                        Matt. They just...grew.

                                 DANIEL
                        I feel like you’ve been keeping an 
                        huge secret from me. Like now I 
                        wouldn’t be surprised at all if you 
                        told me you had a dick.

           Another Fat Russian comes in and sits next to Daniel.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Really?

           Chelsea laughs. Daniel just looks at her, mock upset.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m finding you a guy. Let’s go.

           EXT. GRAMERCY PARK - SAME

           Jason walks with Ellie through the beautiful south side of 
           Gramercy park on their date. They see one of the few 
           remaining mansions that are FOR SALE.

                                 ELLIE
                        That’s kind of my dream. To live 
                        here and have a key to Gramercy 
                        Park. I know I’m romanticizing the 
                        idea, but...

                                 JASON
                        New York’s charm is you’re 
                        surrounded by things you can’t 
                        have.
                                 ELLIE
                        New York’s charm is that it makes 
                        you think you can have them.

           Ellie looks directly at Jason as she says this.

                                 JASON
                        You want to get a drink?

           INT. TORTILLA FLATS

           An overdecorated, kitschy tequila bar on the west side 
           appropriate for celebrations and getting hammered.

           Two giant shots line up. Down they go. They each make faces.

                                 JASON
                        Oh god. That was an awful face.

                                 ELLIE
                        So was yours. You looked like the 
                        landlord on Three’s Company.

                                 JASON
                        I can’t remember if your orgasm 
                        face looks like that, but if it 
                        does, I understand why you’re not 
                        in a relationship.

                                 ELLIE
                        Butthead. You never saw my orgasm 
                        face. 

                                 JASON
                        Butthead?! Bartender! No more 
                        tequila for this one. She’s drunk, 
                        mean, and thinks it’s 1993.

           Ellie laughs and hits him in the arm. He pulls he close. They 
           linger for a moment. Then KISS.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Should we go back to mine? It’s 
                        around the corner.

                                 ELLIE
                        I’ve gotta get home.

                                 JASON
                        Yours it is then. You’re one hell 
                        of a negotiator. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JASON (CONT'D)
                        You’re like Denzel Washington in 
                        every movie he’s ever been in.

                                 ELLIE
                        This type of stuff just flows off 
                        your tongue, mister. 

                                 JASON
                        I’m just trying to make you laugh.

                                 ELLIE
                        Well I don’t like how well it’s 
                        working. 

           She kisses him on the cheek, and gets up.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        I never press too hard for a girl 
                        to come home with me. 

           Jason gets up, buttons his jacket, and starts walking out of 
           the bar. He takes out his phone.

                                 JASON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I think that’s one of the reasons 
                        most of them eventually do. I 
                        celebrated a successful date in my 
                        usual fashion.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT

           Jason opens his door and sees ALANA, cute, bohemian-sexy, 
           pixie of a girl. Crooked smile...

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        By having sex with someone else.

           She breezes past him, effortless and cool.

                                 JASON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Alana is a young, wannabe Broadway 
                        actress I met one night in the West 
                        Village.

                                 ALANA
                        You smell like liquor. You’ve been 
                        drinking when you should be 
                        drawing. 

                                 JASON
                        I don’t drink any more.
                                 ALANA
                        Or any less. I’ll have a vodka. 

                                 JASON
                        Yes you will.

           He goes to make her drink.

                                 ALANA
                        Biggest audition of my life 
                        tomorrow. I need your help.

                                 JASON
                        What play?

                                 ALANA
                        The Seagull. 

                                 JASON
                        Chekov. 

                                 ALANA
                        Last I checked.

                                 JASON
                        Off or on?

                                 ALANA
                        Broadway? Better. The park.

                                 JASON
                        It’s Shakespeare in the Park.

                                 ALANA
                        They’re letting anyone in these 
                        days. Even the Russians. 

                                 JASON
                        Speaking of.

           Jason hold out her vodka, smiling wide at their exchange. 
           Just as her crooked smirk turns smile, we SLAM CUT TO:

           INT. JASON’S BEDROOM

           Jason and Alana are having sex. He’s behind her. They’re 
           getting into it when...

                                 ALANA
                        So...what’re we doing, Jason?

           Jason’s face registers the “so.” With a look that just says 
           FUCK, he stops.
                                 JASON
                        I think you’re an amazing girl. And 
                        if I were in a different place... 
                        But you know I’m not looking for 
                        anything serious right now - 

                                 ALANA
                        ...and the minute this stops being 
                        fun for one of us. Yeah, yeah. I 
                        know.

           She slides off him, goes over the edge of the bed into her 
           handbag, and hits him in the chest with a copy of THE 
           SEAGULL. He laughs.

           INT. WEST VILLAGE DIVE

           A shitty bar. Daniel and Chelsea are having a beer. A piano 
           sits in the corner for patrons to play. A well dressed, 
           ATTRACTIVE GUY is playing the blues.

                                 DANIEL
                        The blues? I mean, what the fuck 
                        does Captain Attractive have to be 
                        sad about?

                                 CHELSEA
                        He’s brooding. Dark. Mysterious.

                                 DANIEL
                        You can’t be that good looking and 
                        have a skill. That’s bullshit. 

                                 CHELSEA
                        I’m gonna play.

                                 DANIEL
                        Ooh, he’s going down. 

           Daniel finishes his beer.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Cheer up asshole, you’re our guy.

           As ATTRACTIVE GUY finishes his song, people drunkenly clap. 
           He walks past, and Daniel grabs him.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Fantastic job. Let me buy you a 
                        drink.
                                 ATTRACTIVE GUY
                        Oh thank you. But no thanks.

                                 DANIEL
                        At least meet my beautiful friend 
                        Chelsea. She’ll outplay you any day 
                        of the week.

                                 ATTRACTIVE GUY
                        I’d let her. I’m Diego.

           Chelsea takes Attractive Guys’s hand.

                                 DANIEL
                        Hitting the bathroom. Be careful 
                        Diego, she can be very, very 
                        aggressive -  but can often be 
                        tamed with tequila and compliments.

           And Daniel’s gone.

           MINUTES LATER

           As Daniel comes back from the bathroom, Chelsea’s playing 
           SOMETHING by the Beatles, singing. It’s mesmerizing.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Something in the way she moves.

           Chelsea, pauses, takes a tequila shot. People laugh.

                                 CHELSEA (CONT’D)
                        Moves you like...no other lover.

           And Daniel is transfixed.

           INT. MEDIAWORKS

           Jason is drawing on his tablet at his computer. Daniel rushes 
           over. He pulls up a seat, out of breath.

                                 DANIEL
                        I fucked her. I fucked Chelsea. 

                                 JASON
                        No! How was it?

           Long, contemplative beat.
                                 DANIEL
                        It was kinda like fucking one of 
                        you guys. Except cleaner and better 
                        looking.

                                 JASON
                        I’ve seen this coming for years-

           Fred, their boss, walks up.

                                 FRED
                        Hey guys. It’s Fred.

                                 JASON
                        Hey Daniel. Is Fred here?

                                 DANIEL
                        Tough to say. There’s some guy 
                        standing here. 

                                 JASON
                        Maybe if he told us he was here. 

                                 FRED
                        Funny. You guys are very funny. And 
                        talented, apparently. Simon and 
                        Simon was ecstatic about your work 
                        on the Husband Shopper and they 
                        want options for the new Matterhorn 
                        novel.

                                 JASON
                        Wow. That’s huge. Jack Matterhorn.

           He hands them a picture of Jack Matterhorn. He’s got the 
           intense look of a successful dude. A man of the world.

                                 DANIEL
                        What’s this?

                                 FRED
                        Matterhorn likes his picture to be 
                        on the cover. That’s the only 
                        stipulation.

                                 FRED (CONT’D)
                        Work together. And Jason, don’t 
                        screw this up. One more stunt and 
                        you’re gone. 

           Jason nods, turns to Daniel.
                                 JASON
                        I guess that is Fred.

                        Ahh. Facebook acceptance. Is there 
                        any other kind?

           Mikey jumps up and looks at Jason’s laptop.

                                 MIKEY
                        I really need to get on that.

                                 JASON
                        I can’t believe you’re not on 
                        Facebook. It’s the easiest way to

                        You could date this girl like that. 

                                 JASON
                        One could date a girl like that. If 
                        one was looking for a relationship.

                                 MIKEY
                        You’re gonna end up old and alone

                                 JASON
                        Now, why would you say that to a 
                        friend?

           Mikey shakes his head.

                                 MIKEY
                        So, what’re you going to do?
                                 JASON
                        If I want to get her on the roster, 
                        I’ve gotta impress her. Go big.

           EXT. GRAMERCY PARK - EVENING

           The mansion that’s for sale, beautifully illuminated as the 
           late summer sun sets...

           INT. GRAMERCY PARK MANSION - FOYER

           A stuffy old realtor, Ms. Rose, guides them around. Ellie’s 
           decked out in a beautiful dress and fur jacket. She looks 
           hot. Jason’s looking especially handsome in his well cut 
           black jacket, nice shirt and tie.

                                 MS. ROSE
                        You’ve chosen to look at a 
                        wonderful property Mr. Von...

                                 JASON
                        (affected accent)
                        Ferrington. Von Ferrington.

                                 MS. ROSE
                        It’s one of the finest properties 
                        in the city.

           INT. GRAMERCY PARK MANSION - HALLWAY

           Ms. Rose reaches into a antique drawer and pulls out A KEY.

                                 MS. ROSE
                        Unfettered access to the private 
                        park is, of course, one of the 
                        finest things about living on 
                        Gramercy.

           They walk into the MASTER BEDROOM

           Ellie takes Jason’s hand. They shut the door to the bedroom. 
           Ellie locks it. They jump on the gargantuan bed and sit with 
           their legs hanging off the side. She takes his hand.

                                 JASON
                        Give me unfettered access to your 
                        private park.

           She almost starts laughing. Pushes him onto the bed.
                                 ELLIE
                        Oh god! Just like that!

                                 MS. ROSE
                        I hate to interrupt, but the two of 
                        you must come out now.

                                 ELLIE
                        Would you like to watch Ms. Rose?

           Ms. Rose gasps. 

           LATER

           Ellie and Jason are making the LOUDEST SEX NOISES they can. 
           Suddenly, there is a louder knock at the door.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Whooooo isssss it?

                                 MAN
                        This is the police. Now open the 
                        door immediately. You’re 
                        trespassing on private property.

           EXT. ROOFTOP

           They go to the front of the building and immediately see a 
           police cruiser with another Cop standing by it. He sees them 
           and talks into his shoulder walkie.

                                 ELLIE
                        He looked at me! Run!

           They take off.

                                 JASON
                        Why do old people always call the 
                        police?

           They take off across the roof. They’re jumping from roof to 
           roof, laughing. They make their way down a fire escape to the 
           bottom, and drop down, right next to a bum.

                                 BUM
                        Y’all crazy.

           They start walking, out of breath, smiling.

                                 JASON
                        Walk normally.
                                 ELLIE
                        This is how I walk.

                                 JASON
                        You’re walking like a criminal.

           She grabs his arm as they walk down the street.

                                 ELLIE
                        I’m not a criminal.

                                 JASON
                        I am.

           And he holds up the KEY TO GRAMERCY PARK - which he stole.

           EXT. GRAMERCY PARK GATE - LATER

           They look around, and open it up. The park is theirs. They 
           walk in and sit on one of the benches. She puts her head on 
           his shoulder.

                                 ELLIE
                        When I was a kid, I used to love 
                        going to the park. My grandfather 
                        would take me on Sundays. My ex-
                        boyfriend hated parks. He thought 
                        they were too public.

                                 JASON
                        Sounds like a real dick.

                                 ELLIE
                        My ex?

                                 JASON
                        No, your grandfather.

           She smiles. Shakes her head.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        What happened with the two of you?

                                 ELLIE
                        I graduated from school and wanted 
                        to move to New York. He took a job 
                        in Chicago. You know, focus on your 
                        work life first. That’s how things 
                        work these days.
                                 JASON
                        They call us the selfish 
                        generation.

                                 ELLIE
                        What about you? Who’s the one that 
                        got you?

           Jason doesn’t want to let her in, so he jokes...

                                 JASON
                        How dare you assume that I have any 
                        emotional capacity whatsoever? Get 
                        out of my park.

           He lifts her head off his shoulder. Jason takes one of her 
           necklaces, and places the Gramercy Park Key on it.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        Damn it!

           INT. ELLIE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Jason and Ellie are lying post coital, wrapped in sheets. 

                                 ELLIE
                        I was so not gonna do that. I was 
                        gonna hold out. Make you wait like 
                        forty days or something. 

                                 JASON
                        I was gonna make you wait too, but 
                        then I realized I’m a dude.

           She laughs, and hits him with a pillow.

           EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY - PARK

           Sun rising. Smell of the river. People ride bicycles, 
           exercising, as joggers dodge in and out. Fleece tops and 
           shorts signal the end of summer.

           INT. HOSPITAL BATHROOM

           Mikey is taking a leak. Another doctor walks in an pulls up 
           to the adjacent urinal. 

                                 MIKEY
                        How you holding up?
           The Other Doctor casually looks over.

                                 OTHER DOCTOR
                        Well...Holy shit! 

                                 MIKEY
                        What?

                                 OTHER DOCTOR
                        Your dick is...I mean, I wasn’t 
                        looking for it...

                                 MIKEY
                        Yeah, I accidentally beat off with 
                        some tanning cream.

           Other Doctor just stares straight at Mikey. Not laughing, 
           professional. Another doctor.

                                 OTHER DOCTOR
                        Your dick looks like fall in New 
                        England.

           Long beat. Then the other doctor exits. Mikey takes a long 
           look at himself in the mirror. 

                                 MIKEY
                        You can do this...

           He takes out his cell phone, and DIALS.

           INT. JASON/MIKEY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Jason and Daniel are playing videogames on the couch. Mikey 
           comes in wearing his scrubs. 

                                 MIKEY
                        I did it! I got a date with my 
                        wife.

           Mikey is proud of himself. 

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re gonna date your wife? Jesus, 
                        you really are bad at this.

                                 JASON
                        How’d you make it happen?

                                 MIKEY
                        I told her I needed to speak with 
                        her. That it was urgent. 
                                 JASON
                        She get right back to you?

                                 MIKEY
                        Instantly, which I think is a good 
                        sign.

                                 JASON
                        That is a good sign. Where you 
                        meeting her?

                                 MIKEY
                        The hospital. 

           Daniel bursts out laughing.

                                 MIKEY (CONT’D)
                        What? I have to work late.

                                 JASON
                        She have any problems. Any tests 
                        done recently?

           Mikey’s face registers shock. Yes she did. The guys notice.

                                 DANIEL
                        She’s coming to see you because she 
                        thinks she’s dying.

                                 MIKEY
                        No. That, uh, that’s not true.

                                 DANIEL
                        You my friend, are a manipulative 
                        genius. I’ve never respected you 
                        more than I do right now.

                                 MIKEY
                        She agreed to come because she felt 
                        the same spark I did the other 
                        night. There was a spark.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           Vera RUSHES in.

                                 VERA
                        My grandmother had ovarian cancer. 
                        Be honest with me.

           She’s starting to tear up. Mikey freezes. Whoops.
                                 MIKEY
                        No! God no.

           Mikey hugs her. She doesn’t resist. Mikey is struggling for 
           the words.

                                 MIKEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not that at all. You’re fine. 
                        The tests they ran indicated 
                        nothing out of the ordinary.

                                 VERA
                        You scared the living shit out of 
                        me.

           She looks up into his face. Close.

                                 MIKEY
                        I’m sorry. I just...wanted to see 
                        you.

           There goes his game. She starts laughing. At first in fits. 
           Then full on laughter.

                                 VERA
                        You are such an idiot sometimes.

           Mikey fidgets, gives up his game even further...

                                 MIKEY
                        What happened Vera? What happened 
                        to us?

                                 VERA
                        What happened? What happened was 
                        jobs and life and predictability. 
                        We got married at 25. I don’t think 
                        at that point you’re ready for a 
                        life without excitement, or... 
                        spontaneity.

                                 MIKEY
                        Spontaneity? I’m spontaneous!

                                 VERA
                        We didn’t have sex for almost six 
                        months.

                                 MIKEY
                        You want spontaneous? I’ll show you 
                        the definition of spontaneous. 
                        Adjective. Performed without 
                        premeditation...
           INT. HOSPITAL - RECOVERY ROOM

           Mikey and Vera finish having sex on a hospital bed.

                                 VERA
                        Satisfied. Adjective. What you just 
                        made me.

                                 MIKEY
                        I could get fired. I could get 
                        fired! That would be so...badass.

           We pan over, and an old guy, MR. GOLDBLUM is recovering from 
           surgery on a nearby bed.

                                 VERA
                        I think he just moved. Please tell 
                        me he didn’t just wake up.

                                 MIKEY
                        Take it easy. Mr. Goldblum will be 
                        asleep for another twenty minutes.

           Vera is out of bed, smoothing her skirt. Mikey jumps out too. 
           He’s naked.

                                 VERA
                        Whoa!

                                 MIKEY
                        What’s wrong?

                                 VERA
                        Your dick looks like a cartoon 
                        goldfish.

                           MIKEY
           It’s a long story-
                                                          VERA
                                              We can’t do this.

                                 MIKEY
                        What? The color isn’t dangerous. 
                        It’ll fade-

                                 VERA
                        No. I mean you and me. The sex.

                                 MIKEY
                        The spontaneity. The adjectives.

                                 VERA
                        I...got caught up in the moment. I 
                        don’t know Mikey.

                        I thought I was dying for Christ 
                        sake. I’m with Harold now. You know 
                        that. (beat) I’m sorry.

           INT. DELI - NIGHT

           Jason buys a six pack at the Korean deli. As he’s walking 
           out, he sees a poster for a show at the PUBLIC THEATER.

           It’s Alana, the young actress from the beginning. He smiles.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT

           Jason comes home to find Mikey and Daniel sitting on the 
           couch. Daniel checks his watch.

                                 JASON
                        Everything...okay?

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s Friday night. We expect you to 
                        be here, helping prolong our 
                        adolescence by drinking heavily, 
                        playing video games, and preparing 
                        to chase women.

                                 MIKEY
                        It’s important for the continuation 
                        of humanity. We must spread our 
                        seed.

           He sits down and starts playing. The guys, back together. The 
           BUZZER sounds.

                                 DANIEL
                        Who’s that?

                                 JASON
                        Ellie. I invited her over.

           Daniel and Mikey stare at Jason.

                                 DANIEL
                        You what?! This is a den of 
                        testosterone. 

                                 MIKEY
                        This is a pre-game.

                                 JASON
                        This is my apartment.
                                 MIKEY
                        He’s got a point there.

                                 DANIEL
                        Shut up Mikey. This is a pre mating 
                        dance that to the outside world, 
                        will make us look like fucking 
                        idiots. Which we’re not.

           He slugs his beer as Jason gets up. Buzzes her in.

                                 JASON
                        Don’t worry about her. She’s cool. 

                                 DANIEL
                        She’s probably gonna want to talk 
                        about shit that doesn’t involve 
                        XBox or makes me feel bad about my 
                        drinking problem. 

           Ellie pushes open the door.

                                 ELLIE
                        Hey. Hope I’m not interrupting.

                                 JASON
                        This is Mikey and Daniel. We went 
                        to college together. Daniel is a 
                        manipulative idiot and Mikey has an 
                        orange dick.

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s not that big.

                                 MIKEY
                        Fuck off, man. It’s the fact I 
                        never use it that counts.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh my god. I have this recurring 
                        dream where I’m being grossly 
                        manipulated by a large orange 
                        penis.

                                 JASON
                        You’ve come to the right place. 
                        Sadly.

                                 ELLIE
                        I didn’t know what you guys drink. 
                        And frankly I don’t care, so I 
                        brought scotch.
                                 MIKEY
                        I love scotch.

                                 DANIEL
                        I love Ellie.

                                 JASON
                        Crazy she managed to carry this all 
                        the way up to my apartment... 
                        Daniel.

                                 DANIEL
                        My constitution is fragile.

                                 MIKEY
                        And cheap, apparently.

           Ellie spies the video game on TV.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh wow. I’ve been playing that game 
                        at a friend’s place and I’ll tell 
                        you right now, I’m incredible.

           Ellie tries to sit on the couch between the two guys. Ellie 
           kills someone. Not bad. The guys all smile.

           LATER

           They’re all more drunk. Ellie shifts her bag and a manuscript 
           falls out.

                                 MIKEY
                        The new Matterhorn manuscript?

                                 ELLIE
                        I’ve been brought on to edit it.

                                 JASON
                        That guy is so prolific, and you 
                        know what really kills me - 

                                 DANIEL
                        The fact that he’s so good.

                                 ELLIE
                        You know, one of the other authors 
                        I work with slept with him. Said 
                        his dick was like a Pringle can.

                                 ALL THE GUYS
                        No!/Ugggghhh/Really??
                                 MIKEY
                        You know, his medical thrillers are 
                        actually plausible. 

                                 JASON
                        Unlike his dick. 

                                 ELLIE
                        He’s actually doctor. Started 
                        writing his books in Med School.

                                 JASON
                        How does someone find the time to 
                        be all those things? If I had that 
                        kind of time, I’d probably be a 
                        Buddhist. 

           Mikey is lost in thought.

                                 MIKEY
                        I’d probably just end up 
                        masturbating more. And then I’d get 
                        depressed about that, and have to 
                        masturbate through it.

                                 DANIEL
                        Sorry to interrupt Mikey, you human 
                        funeral, but we need to find the 
                        time to get to the bar. 

           Ellie checks her phone.

                                 ELLIE
                        Ahhh. Late. Gotta get west side. 
                        You guys have fun.

           She kisses Jason on the cheek, and opens the door.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and Mikey, I gotta a feeling 
                        tonight’s your night.

           She skirts out.

                                 MIKEY
                        I love her. Like love, love. 

           Off Jason’s smile we CUT TO:

           A SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS APPEAR ON FACEBOOK.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT

           They finish watching SHAVING RYAN’S PRIVATES. The porn 
           version of the movie.

                                 ELLIE
                        This type of porn is so ludicrous. 
                        It’s asexual.

                                 JASON
                        Why do they always fuck in high 
                        tops and tube socks? 

                                 ELLIE
                        I know. It doesn’t even look like 
                        sex. It looks like the guy is 
                        working out on a tanned nautilus 
                        machine.

                                 JASON
                        This could be detrimental to a 
                        young kid looking for some 
                        guidance.

                                 ELLIE
                        Maybe there’s a whole generation of 
                        internet raised kids fucking in 
                        Gold’s Gym attire.

           INT. JASON’S BEDROOM

           Ellie and Jason have sex. We float down to see he’s wearing 
           athletic socks and some basketball sneakers.

                                 ELLIE
                        Wait wait. I can’t. I can’t look at 
                        you.

                                 JASON
                        (genuinely excited)
                        The stability is tremendous.
           Close On: FACEBOOK

           *Lots of pictures now appear. One after the other.

           INT. JASON’S BEDROOM

           He looks at the facebook IN A RELATIONSHIP status button. 
           Perhaps for the first time he realizes it exists.

           He signs off.

           INT. WEST VILLAGE DIVE

           The same shitty bar. Daniel and Chelsea are having a beer. 
           The piano sits in the corner. Bartender sets down some 
           drinks.

           Chelsea goes to pay...

                                 DANIEL
                        No, uh...I got it.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Aww. Thanks.

           A HANDSOME MAN parks next to Chelsea.

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        Ahh, I was just about to get you a 
                        drink. But it looks like you’re 
                        covered.

           Daniel smiles. Idiot.

                                 DANIEL
                        Hey, I’m entirely too cheap to buy 
                        you something. But I’m handsome. 
                        Fantastic game, sir.

           Chelsea laughs.

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        Just saying hello.

           Daniel and Chelsea just look at each other. Unsure what’s 
           happening here. What to do. Handsome man feels awkward, and 
           leaves.

                                 HANDSOME MAN (CONT’D)
                        And now I’ll say good bye.
           Daniel takes a long sip, his eyes never leaving Chelsea.

           INT. MEDIAWORKS

           Jason and Daniel are looking at six mock-ups of the 
           Matterhorn book.

                                 JASON
                        I don’t know. They’re not working.

                                 DANIEL
                        We need something classic. There’s 
                        a lot of pressure here.

           Jason puts down his pen.

                                 JASON
                        Speaking of. How’s Chelsea?

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know. I feel like every 
                        move I make. She knows. It’s like 
                        doing standup comedy for someone 
                        who’s seen your show.

                                 JASON
                        You guys still hang out all the 
                        time?

                                 DANIEL
                        Now that we’ve had sex the whole 
                        dynamic changes. Every hangout-

                                 JASON
                        -Becomes a date.

                                 DANIEL
                        Exactly. Too many of those and...

                                 JASON
                        And you’ll get the “so.”

                                 DANIEL
                        When it comes to girls, nothing 
                        good ever follows the word “so.” So 
                        what’re we doing? So where’s this 
                        going?

           They just nod at each other as we CUT TO:
           EXT. TIMES SQUARE

           Daniel and Chelsea are riding the double decker tour bus 
           through Times Square. The tourguide is a real New York 
           character, with a Bronx accent.

                                 CHELSEA
                        You ever taken a tour before?

                                 DANIEL
                        No. It’s not something you do when 
                        you’re pretending you’re from here.

                                 TOURGUIDE
                        In the nineteen twenties this area 
                        was called the tenderloin. Because 
                        it was considered the most 
                        desirable area in the city.

                                 DANIEL
                        There’s so much shit you don’t 
                        know. 

                                 TOURGUIDE
                        Then in the nineteen thirties - 
                        during the great depression - the 
                        area became wrought with gambling 
                        and prostitution. So I guess you 
                        could still call it the 
                        tender...loin.

           Laughs from all around.

                                 DANIEL
                        This guy is really unfunny. We 
                        should kill him.

                                 CHELSEA
                        What? I love this guy. I want to do 
                        his job.

                                 DANIEL
                        Really? Why? You want to talk to 
                        tourists all day? Tell the same 
                        stupid jokes. Stick to Sotheby’s.

                                 CHELSEA
                        You’re not open to things Daniel. 
                        You’ve always been this way. 
                                 DANIEL
                        Just because I don’t want to be a 
                        tourguide? Jesus. I thought you had 
                        higher hopes for me.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Maybe I do.

           INT. HOSPITAL

           Mikey clicks on his new Facebook page. He has zero friends. 
           He types in his wife’s name. VERA PASSMAN. He “Friend 
           Requests” her. Satisfied, he shuts down the computer, and 
           grabs his bag - leaving for the night.

           INT. ELLIE’S BATHROOM

           Jason walks into the bathroom.

                                 JASON
                        I’m just gonna brush my teeth.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                        Okay, then we gotta go.

           Sitting there on the bathroom sink is a new toothbrush. Jason 
           unwraps it, brushes.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Mikey, with renewed vigor, breathing heavily as he 
           contemplates pressing “call.”

                                 MIKEY
                        I’m gonna call her and ask her. I’m 
                        gonna stick to the plan. And I’m 
                        not taking no for an answer.

           He holds his breath, goes to press SEND on the phone, then 
           lets his breath out.

                                 MIKEY (CONT’D)
                        I am a huge pussy. C’mon Mikey. You 
                        can do this.

           He takes a deep breath, holds it, and DIALS. She answers.
                                 MIKEY (CONT’D)
                        You want spontaneous, Vera? Well 
                        I’m coming over right now, we’re 
                        making love on the living room 
                        floor, then we’re going to that 
                        little wine bar downstairs, the one 
                        you love, and drinking dry reds 
                        until four in the morning. I don’t 
                        give a shit about my hangover. I’ll 
                        get an IV in the morning. I’m a 
                        fucking doctor. I can do that. And 
                        I’m not taking no for an answer.

           A long beat. Mikey winces.

                                 VERA 
                        Harold’s here, Mikey. You can’t 
                        come over. 

           Mikey is deflated. His moment is gone.

                                 MIKEY
                        Oh. Yeah. Okay...

                                 VERA
                        Can you do Thursday?

                                 MIKEY
                        What? Yeah.

                                 VERA
                        And can you behave exactly the way 
                        you just did? 

           INT. DANIEL’S BEDROOM

           Daniel and Chelsea are having sex. Daniel is on top of her.

                                 CHELSEA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m just looking at this teddy 
                        bear.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Mr. Wiggles?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah. I just know that your ex gave 
                        it to you. And I told you he was a 
                        pussy. And you broke up with him. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        And then I was thinking about you, 
                        with him. And then my boner started 
                        to wilt like warm lettuce.

           They’ve stopped having sex. He rolls off her.

                                 CHELSEA
                        I’ll get rid of the teddybear. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Thank you. 

           Daniel hesitates for one second.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Chels, I just want you to know, so 
                        we’re clear, that I’m...

                          CHELSEA
           ...not looking for anything 
           super serious right now.
                                                         DANIEL
                                              ...not looking for anything 
                                              super serious right now.

           Chelsea is upset, but tries to hide it.

                                 CHELSEA
                        I know. Just because I’m a girl, 
                        Daniel, doesn’t mean I am.

                                 DANIEL
                        I just wanted to make sure we were 
                        on the same page.

           Daniel gets out of the bed.

                                 CHELSEA
                        You staying over?

           Daniel goes out into her living room. We stay with her.

                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                        Yeah. I’ll just make up the couch.

                                 CHELSEA
                        You can sleep in my bed.

                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                        I always sleep on your couch. I’ve 
                        slept there for years.

                                 CHELSEA
                        That’s true, but...

           Daniel comes back in and hands her a glass of water.
                                 DANIEL
                        And I don’t want to crowd you. 

           The ambiguity...

           EXT. EAST VILLAGE - DUSK

           A tremendous amount of activity, energy. People walk every 
           which way. A dude sells his mixtape. Another sells books. 
           Music pours from the bars. A weekend in NYC.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Jason comes home to find Daniel and Mikey sitting on the 
           couch. There are a bunch of beers on the table.

                                 DANIEL
                        Ohhh. There he is. How’s your 
                        girlfriend?

                                 JASON
                        She’s...I don’t have a girlfriend.

                                 DANIEL
                        Bullshit. Well we have a few 
                        questions that will determine if 
                        what you say is true.

           Mikey grabs a magazine off the table and pretends to go down 
           his checklist. Jason takes a beer, sits.

                                 JASON
                        Go for it. 

                                 MIKEY
                        Do you say good night to 
                        her...every night?

                                 DANIEL
                        Even if you’re not with her?

                                 JASON
                        Yes. BBM.

                                 DANIEL
                        BBM is a sacred tool for procuring 
                        pussy, Jason. You don’t use it to 
                        say goodnight. You’re not her mom.

                                 MIKEY
                        Are there implied weekend plans?
                                 JASON
                        Not necessarily.

                                 DANIEL
                        Given how much we’ve seen you 
                        lately, we’ll mark that a yes.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Are there any other girls on your 
                        roster?

                                 JASON
                        Not sleeping with anybody else. But 
                        it could just be a dry spell.

                                 MIKEY
                        We’ll just mark it a no.

                                 DANIEL
                        If Michelle Pfeiffer from Scarface 
                        wanted to fuck you and was lying 
                        next to your girlfriend with her 
                        legs open...

                                 MIKEY
                        And she said, you can only have sex 
                        with one of us, but the other one 
                        will disappear forever. What would 
                        you do?

                                 JASON
                        One would disappear? Then I 
                        wouldn’t fuck either of them. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Shocking. On a yes or no question 
                        you managed to answer, I’m gay.

                                 MIKEY
                        Has the thought of a picnic ever 
                        crossed your mind? Do you have a 
                        drawer for your shit or a 
                        toothbrush at her house?

           Jason has a BIG REALIZATION.

                                 DANIEL
                        You do! If you don’t dial this back 
                        notch, you’re gonna get the “so.”
           INT. ELLIE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Jason and Ellie are lying on the couch together, post sex.

                                 JASON
                        I think I won that one.

                                 ELLIE
                        No way you won that one. If there 
                        was a winner, it was definitely me.

                                 JASON
                        Fine. But you had sex with me. Most 
                        people wouldn’t consider that 
                        winning.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh did you say winning? I thought 
                        you said settling.

           He laughs, covers her face with a pillow. She takes it off.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey. I just want to be sure...and 
                        don’t take this personally. But 
                        since we don’t wear them...I want 
                        to make sure you’re wearing condoms 
                        with other people.

           Jason stares at her.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        And there it was. Classic offensive 
                        female move designed to draw you 
                        into the relationship conversation. 
                        It was also my opportunity to dial 
                        it back.

           Jason is struggling with his decision, and finally...

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Of course I am.

           Long beat. She’s nodding.

           A SERIES OF SCENES

           *Jason, in bed, gets a BBM from Ellie. GOODNIGHT. He writes 
           GOODNIGHT back, but doesn’t send it. He chucks the bb back on 
           the table.
           *Mikey shows up to Vera’s door. She checks the hallway, then 
           ushers him in. CUT TO him leaving moments later. Hair 
           ruffled.

           *Daniel sits at the Russian baths alone. Next to the fat 
           Russian dude.

           *Mikey shows up and leaves. Again.

           *Jason puts the toothbrush from Ellie’s apartment in his 
           pocket. Steals it.

           *Mikey opens the closet in Vera’s apartment. Empty. A 
           reminder of his old life.

           *Daniel is at the movies by himself.

           *Mikey gets out of bed. He peeks in at Vera in the shower. He 
           goes out and opens the closet door. It is now filled with 
           HAROLD’S CLOTHES. Mikey gets a helpless, saddened look.

           *Jason responds to Ellie’s BBM. CANT TONIGHT. LET’S HANG 
           SUNDAY.

                                 JASON
                        Sunday is not the real weekend. 
                        Never has been.

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. GRAMERCY PARK - LATER

           Ellie fidgets with the key around her neck. They sit on a 
           bench and talk.

                                 ELLIE
                        Could you grow old in New York?

                                 JASON
                        I’m not gonna grow old. Being old 
                        looks so tiring. 

                                 ELLIE
                        I know. You just wake up and try to 
                        figure out what to do between 
                        meals.

                                 JASON
                        I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do. 
                        I’m gonna get an old Jaguar XKE. 
                        Totally restored. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JASON (CONT'D)
                        And I’m going to put on all my 
                        finest clothes. Sports jacket, tie.

                                 ELLIE
                        Go cravat. I feel like it fits 
                        where this story is headed. 

                                 JASON
                        Done. Right, then I’m going to eat 
                        a ton of acid. Like enough acid 
                        that if you went to see Cirque de 
                        Soleil you’d think you were in 
                        Connecticut. 

           Jason sits up.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        And I’ll speed up the West Side 
                        Highway, fast as the car can go, 
                        crash straight through the divider 
                        and careen off into the Hudson. 

                                 ELLIE
                        In slow motion, of course.

                                 JASON
                        Of course. And that’ll be it. My 
                        death, premeditated.

           Ellie sits up, gets excited.

                                 ELLIE
                        Okay. Here’s what’ll actually 
                        happen. You’ll be seventy years 
                        old, so you think you’ll be going 
                        150 , but you’ll actually be doing 
                        25 at best, 15 at worst. You can’t 
                        see, so the acid you think you’re 
                        eating will actually be an errant 
                        lipitor. And you’ll probably forget 
                        what you were doing in the car in 
                        the first place, bump into the 
                        divider, wet yourself, ruin your 
                        car, lose your license and your 
                        dignity in one fell swoop, then 
                        promptly get put in a rest home 
                        where you have to wake up and 
                        figure out what to do between 
                        meals.

           A beat.
                                 JASON
                        You don’t have to be right all the 
                        time. It’s unpretty.

                                 ELLIE
                        That’s not a word.

                                 JASON
                        It’s the word I have for what you 
                        are when you’re right all the time.

           They’re having a  really nice moment. No games, no bullshit, 
           just a genuine moment.

                                 ELLIE
                        So...Jason.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        And once again, right on cue. The 
                        “so.”

                                 ELLIE
                        I really like you Jason. You’re fun 
                        and you say all the right things. 

           Jason nods.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        She wants to know where we are. I 
                        get it. And for the first time, I’m 
                        not totally uncomfortable with 
                        that.

                                 ELLIE
                        I can’t do this anymore. 

           LONG BEAT. 

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not a serious guy, Jason. 
                        And that’s okay. Someday you’re 
                        gonna make some girl very happy. 
                        But you don’t want a relationship 
                        right now...and I do.

           Then he just smiles like an asshole, unsure how to handle 
           this. 

                                 JASON
                        Thank you.
           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Jason sits with Daniel on the couch. Daniel pauses the video 
           game. Mikey walks out of his room.

                                 DANIEL
                        You said thank you?!

           Daniel hands Jason a beer.

                                 JASON
                        I don’t know. It’s like the only 
                        thing running through my mind was 
                        manners.

                                 MIKEY
                        Your mother would be proud.

                                 DANIEL
                        Thank you! Ha. I gotta use that 
                        one.

           Jason just gets up, and walks into his room. The door slams.

                                 MIKEY
                        You gotta be more sensitive to 
                        these things. He liked her.

                                 DANIEL
                        Mikey, you don’t know shit about 
                        women. You were married.

           INT. MEDIAWORKS - FRED’S OFFICE

           Jason, looking underslept and generally miserable, sits with 
           Daniel. Fred walks in, not happy.

                                 FRED
                        Hey guys, it’s-

                                 JASON
                        Yeah. Got it. Hi Fred.

                                 FRED
                        Simon and Simon sent back our 
                        initial designs, and they’d like a 
                        face to face on the creative.

                                 DANIEL
                        They didn’t like them?
                                 FRED
                        Well, they didn’t get a good 
                        feeling. Book’s printing was 
                        delayed two months. Coming out at 
                        the holidays.

                                 JASON
                        They don’t know what they want. 

                                 FRED
                        That may be the case, but I don’t 
                        feel like you guys are giving it 
                        your best. Have you read the book?

                                 JASON
                        Read the book? I have a pretty good 
                        sense of what’s inside.

                                 FRED
                        Read the book and give me a couple 
                        good options by Friday.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT

           Jason sits on the couch playing videogames. Miserable.

                                 DANIEL
                        Okay, give it to me. When’s the 
                        last time you talked.

                                 JASON
                        Couple weeks. Sent her a bbm. She 
                        hung my fucking R.

                                 DANIEL
                        No.

                                 JASON
                        Yes. She read the message, and 
                        didn’t reply. And the little “R” is 
                        sitting there, mocking me. 

                                 DANIEL
                        She didn’t reply? Well, fuck her 
                        man. We’re not in that place in our 
                        lives to be getting serious...isn’t 
                        that the point? Great girls, wrong 
                        time. 
                                 JASON
                        It’s just...I thought we 
                        were...heading in a different 
                        direction. And it’s her birthday 
                        tomorrow.

           Daniel SLAPS Jason. 

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Oww. What the fuck man?

           Daniel stands up.

                                 DANIEL
                        You want a relationship? All our 
                        friends in relationships are 
                        fucking miserable. You think we’d 
                        be able to sit here and get 
                        shitfaced if we were in 
                        relationships? No, we’d have to be 
                        watching Top Chef and planning a 
                        trip to a bed and fucking 
                        breakfast. That’s what old people 
                        do. That’s what people in 
                        relationships do.

                                 JASON
                        I know but-

                                 DANIEL
                        -But nothing, motherfucker. That’s 
                        what the rules are for. To keep you 
                        out of a relationship. And guess 
                        what? They worked this time. 

           Daniel throws him another beer.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        I can barely look at you right now 
                        because all I’m seeing is a vagina 
                        with two legs, arms and a head. And 
                        that’s a really, really strange 
                        thing to see. 

           Jason breaks. A little. Enough.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        We’re going out. And we’re getting 
                        you a girl.
           EXT. JASON’S APARTMENT

           The guys burst out the door, drinking and having fun in a 
           scene reminiscent of the beginning.

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s good to have you back, buddy. 
                        Thought we lost you for a second.

                                 JASON
                        No. I’m back. I don’t know what I 
                        was thinking.

           INT. EAST VILLAGE BAR

           Jason and Daniel are slamming a tequila shot. They’re close 
           to shitfaced. 

                                 DANIEL
                        This could be the night where I 
                        finally shit myself.

           Two GIRLS sidle up next to the guys at the bar. 

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        This is not the end of the world my 
                        friend. I know. You like Ellie. But 
                        you’ve maintained your freedom.

                                 JASON
                        You’re so right. (starting to slur) 
                        I’m finally thinking clearly about 
                        this. 

                                 DANIEL
                        This is what freedom looks like. 

           They look over at the girls. One of them is HOT. The other is 
           FAT.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes freedom is a beautiful 
                        thing, and sometimes, it’s just 
                        ...fat.

           QUICK SHOTS

           *The guys taking shot after shot with the girls.

           *Jason talks to Hot, Daniel talks to Fat.
           *The Fat Girl gets up wanders over to Jason. She’s drunk.

                                 FAT
                        I heard you keep the windows open 
                        in your house just so you know what 
                        it feels like to be homeless. To 
                        understand.

           Jason looks at Daniel, who mouths...

                                 DANIEL
                        Braveheart.

                                 JASON
                        (mouths back)Ass-hole.

           Fat hugs Jason just as Ellie, who is out with her girlfriend 
           ANDREA, comes over. Jason sees her just as they walk up to 
           order.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Heeeeeeeyyyyy you.

                                 ELLIE
                        Hey Jason. This is Andrea. 

                                 ANDREA
                        You’re the sailboat guy? Heard a 
                        lot about you.

           Jason is shitfaced, trying to hold it together.

                                 JASON
                        Sailboat what? You heard about me? 
                        Cool, this is, ummm, somebody who 
                        was at the bar.

           Daniel swoops in and grabs Fat’s hand, pulling her away.

                                 DANIEL
                        Time for another tequila 
                        sweetheart.

                                 ANDREA
                        You coming to Ellie’s tomorrow?

                                 JASON
                        Huh?

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh, I’m having a birthday party 
                        tomorrow at my place. You should 
                        come. Gotta dress up, though.
           We can see it on Jason’s face. He wishes he was invited...

           EXT. VON BAR

           Jason grabs Daniel and pulls him aside.

                                 JASON
                        Dude, you need to jump on the 
                        grenade for me.

                                 DANIEL
                        Grenade?

                                 JASON
                        Just do her friend. It’s your duty 
                        as wingman.

           The look over at Fat, who is laughing.

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t see a grenade. That 
                        enormous wookie must have eaten it. 

                                 FAT
                        I peed a little when I laughed. 
                        Hee. (burp)

                                 JASON
                        I think my erection just pulled a 
                        Kaiser Sozay. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Sorry buddy, that’s not a grenade. 
                        That there is like ramming a 
                        nuclear bomb straight up your ass.

           Daniel taps him on the shoulder, and walks off. 

           INT. HOT GIRL’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Jason is sitting on the couch. At this point, he’s completely 
           shitfaced.

                                 HOT (O.S.)
                        Beer’s okay?

                                 JASON
                        Cool.

           He looks over and notices that there is a stripper pole.
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Cool.

           And Hot walks out from her kitchen COMPLETELY NAKED, holding 
           two beers.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Cool. 

                                 HOT
                        Want to see something incredible? 
                        Get ready for it.

                                 JASON
                        Cool.

           She puts down her beer, and LEAPS onto the pole upside down, 
           with her legs spread facing away from Jason. She’s trying to 
           make sexy eye contact with him. 

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Cool.

           She begins lowering herself down the pole. Skin CREAKS 
           against the bare metal. Inch by painful, unsexy inch she 
           slides downward. Jason just calmly drinks his beer and 
           stares.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Cool.

           She lets go and hits the ground with a thump. Her legs flop 
           over her head and she PASSES OUT, ass in the air.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Cool.

           Drunk as shit, Jason just stares at this heap of flesh as a 
           bedroom door opens and another heap of flesh, Fat Girl, is 
           standing there in a t-shirt and underwear.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Cool.

           INT. FAT’S BEDROOM

           A Black and White photo of New York gets more and more 
           crooked as we hear the sounds of hard sex and a bed creaking.

           We float down to find a large set of legs up in the air while 
           Jason has aggressive sex with Fat Girl as Biggie plays in the 
           BG.
                                 BIGGIE
                        It was all a dream, we used read 
                        Word Up Magazine...

           Jason looks terrified as he pumps harder. He could easily be 
           working out. CUT TO:

           INT. HOT’S APARTMENT - REALITY

           Jason chokes back some creeping vomit. He rubs his eyes, then 
           gets up and staggers out.

           EXT. CHELSEA’S APARTMENT

           Daniel eats a slice of pizza and looks up at the window. He’s 
           calling her phone.

           Chelsea comes to the window.

           INT. CHELSEA’S APARTMENT

           Daniel flops on the couch, shitfaced.

                                 CHELSEA
                        You’re booty calling me now?

           He’s taking off his pants, which get stuck at his ankles.

                                 DANIEL
                        Fuck. Let’s do it. Right now.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Oh my god yes! Nothing says sexy 
                        like a man trying not to throw up.

           Daniel grins.

                                 CHELSEA (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna get you some water. And 
                        make the couch.

           EXT. CAFE HABANA - MORNING

           Crowded and busy little Cuban breakfast joint on Elizabeth 
           Street. The people and food are both good looking. Jason 
           comes in and sits down with Mikey and Daniel at the counter.
                                 JASON
                        Seeing Ellie fucked me up. She 
                        inadvertently invited me to a party 
                        at her house. 

                                 DANIEL
                        You got the inadvertent invite?

                                 JASON
                        Yeah. Her friend let it slip. 

                                 MIKEY
                        Ouch.

                                 JASON
                        I need to reverse this. I was 
                        thinking of running...A Jagger.

                                 DANIEL
                        Now? Forget it. Run a Curtain Call, 
                        replenish the roster, move on. 
                        C’mon, we had fun last night.

                                 MIKEY
                        A Jagger? A Curtain Call? What are 
                        you guys talking about?

                                 DANIEL
                        A Jagger, Mikey. As in Mick. 
                        Classic move. You constantly make a 
                        girl associate you with sex. Mick 
                        Jagger brushes his teeth - all 
                        girls think about is fucking. Takes 
                        out the garbage, fucking. Makes a 
                        phone call - fucking. 

                                 MIKEY
                        So you rekindle the sexual part of 
                        the relationship.

                                 JASON
                        And the emotional part follows 
                        suit. A Jagger it is.

           EXT. PLEASURE CHEST SEX SHOP

           Admidst the Sixth Avenue trash and riff raff, sidewalk book 
           sellers and omnipotent smell of Grey’s Papaya and urine, 
           Jason looks up at the sign.
           INT. SEX SHOP

           Jason is looking at some really big strap on dildos. An 
           Israeli guy comes over.

                                 JASON
                        How much are these?

                                 ISRAELI GUY
                        For you? Seventy five.

                                 JASON
                        Oh, for me? Because we’re good 
                        friends?

           Jason’s phone rings.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Hello. Speaking.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        This is Jack Matterhorn.

                                 ISRAELI GUY
                        Seventy dollars.

                                 JASON
                        That’s too much. (to Jack) What can 
                        I do for you Jack?

                                 MATTERHORN
                        I’ll get right to brass tacks. I’d 
                        like you to kill my wife. 

                                 JASON
                        What?

                                 MATTERHORN
                        Nah, I’m just jackassin ya. I’m not 
                        married. But I have come across 
                        some of your work-

                                 JASON
                        -About the book cover. I’ll get it 
                        done.

                                 ISRAELI GUY
                        Sixty five dollars.

           Jason glares at the sex shop guy.
                                 MATTERHORN
                        I’m sure you will. But more 
                        importantly, I’m thinking about 
                        starting on a graphic novel. And 
                        I’d like to talk to you about the 
                        illustration.

           Jason stammers. Floored.

                                 JASON
                        I- I. Wow. Yes.

                                 MATTERHORN
                        Let’s meet next week to discuss. My 
                        assistant will be in touch.

                                 ISRAELI GUY
                        And I’ll throw in a bottle of lube.

           Jason hangs up quickly. Speechless, shocked. He looks at the 
           Israeli guy.

                                 JASON
                        I don’t need lube, man. It’s for a 
                        costume.

           Long beat.

                                 ISRAELI GUY
                        Sure it is.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT

           Mikey hugs Jason.

                                 MIKEY
                        Holy shit! Matterhorn?? Good for 
                        you man.

                                 JASON
                        Yeah, he just called while I was 
                        buying this giant dildo-

           Mikey abrubtly stops hugging Jason just as Vera walks out of 
           Mikey’s room.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        And- Whoa. Vera.

                                 VERA
                        Hello Jason. I was just leaving.
           Jason just nods. As Vera exits Mikey kisses her. He turns 
           around and looks at Jason.

                                 JASON
                        Dude, you have to be careful here. 
                        She’s burned you twice. Thinks 
                        she’s holding all the chips.

                                 MIKEY
                        I know, but right now...she is.

                                 JASON
                        You want her back? Take the power 
                        away. 

                                 MIKEY
                        I don’t need these stupid games. A 
                        Jagger, or any of that stuff.

           A long beat.

                                 MIKEY (CONT’D)
                        But, out of sheer curiosity, how 
                        would you handle this?

                                 JASON
                        It’s called the Hot Cold. Pull 
                        away. Abruptly and aggressively. 
                        Just when she thinks she has you.

                                 MIKEY
                        And that will help me get her back?

                                 JASON
                        It will even the playing field. And 
                        yes, you’ll get her back.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Thanksgiving is the perfect time.

           Mikey thinks about this. Nods.

                                 MIKEY
                        Hey, gotta be honest, I’m still 
                        feeling weird about hugging you 
                        while you were holding a dildo in a 
                        plastic bag. 
           INT. ELLIE’S APARTMENT

           Jason pushes her cracked open apartment door. He walks into 
           the living room and we see his eighties rocker outfit, 
           complete with the cut off sleeves, bandana on the head, and 
           tight jeans. On his shirt it says ROCK OUT. From his pants 
           protrudes an enormous STRAP ON DILDO. 

           His costume, of course, is ROCK OUT with your COCK OUT. He’s 
           holding a birthday gift in a bag and a six pack of Tecate. He 
           sings...

                                 JASON
                        Happy birthday to you- holy shit.

           We reverse and see everyone else is elegantly “dressed up.” A 
           couple people start laughing.

                                 ELLIE
                        Jason. Wow.

                                 JASON
                        Yeah. So...Happy Birthday.

                                 ELLIE
                        What’re you wearing?

                                 JASON
                        Dress up party. Right.

           A bunch of people laugh. A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE are sitting on 
           the couch, wide eyed.

                                 ELLIE
                        Jason, these are my parents. Bill 
                        and Jodi.

                                 JASON
                        Oh. No. It’s my pleasure to meet 
                        you. Well, not pleasure in the way 
                        you might assume by looking at me. 
                        But, I’m embarrassed. And I’m just 
                        going to pretend this isn’t 
                        happening.

           Jason reaches over Ellie’s mom to shake hands with her dad, 
           the HUGE appendage plops in her mother’s cocktail glass.

                                 ELLIE’S MOM
                        Oh dear!
           Jason stands up, drying off the dildo with his shirt. He 
           looks at her mother. 

                                 JASON
                        Now that’s a cocktail. 

           Ellie’s mom just starts laughing. So does Ellie’s Dad, and 
           everyone else at the party feels comfortable enough to join 
           in. 

           LATER

           Everyone crowded into the small apartment, dancing. Jason is 
           the center of attention. He’s getting a girl to limbo under 
           his fake appendage. Ellie laughs.

           Jason excuses himself and talks to Ellie’s parents. 

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I hope you know, I usually don’t 
                        dress like this.

           Ellie’s Dad hands him a drink, as Ellie comes over. He hugs 
           his daughter.

                                 ELLIE’S DAD
                        And we don’t usually drink like 
                        this. But we love seeing Ellie.

                                 ELLIE’S MOM
                        I’m impressed the way you’ve hung 
                        in there. Most kids would have run 
                        out immediately.

                                 JASON
                        I’m a sucker for abuse. You know 
                        what the hardest part of this 
                        costume is. Seeing this thing next 
                        to your real hardware.

           Ellie’s Dad laughs. Her parents seem to love Jason.

                                 ELLIE’S MOM
                        What’re you laughing at Bill? 

                                 JASON
                        It’s like, you look in the mirror 
                        and don’t know whether to laugh or 
                        just kill yourself. 

           Jason is drinking heavily.
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Did Ellie tell you about the time 
                        we met? In a bout of sheer 
                        stupidity, I mistook her for a 
                        hooker.

           This gets Ellie’s attention, but Jason is in the zone - being 
           funny, charming, and pushing right through his limits.

                                 ELLIE
                        It was nothing. I was just wearing 
                        my high boots.

                                 JASON
                        We had gone home together and, if 
                        you look at me, you gotta think she 
                        wanted to get paid...

           He just told them he slept with their daughter on the first 
           night. Ellie’s parents are now uncomfortable. 

           INT. ELLIE’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY

           Ellie and Jason argue.

                                 ELLIE
                        What were you thinking?

                                 JASON
                        I wasn’t. I was just going with it, 
                        trying a little too hard. No pun-

                                 ELLIE
                        Those are my parents Jason.

                                 JASON
                        I know. You think I put this on and 
                        thought, man, her mom’s gonna dig 
                        this 12 inch cock? I’m a really 
                        good person.

                                 ELLIE
                        Clearly.

                                 JASON
                        I’m sorry. I hope I didn’t screw up 
                        your whole night.

           She shakes her head no.
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you come over later. 
                        We’ll have a drink, I’ll give you a 
                        birthday present you’ll wish you 
                        could forget immediately. (beat) 
                        Sex. (beat) With me.

                                 ELLIE
                        Jason, I’m seeing someone.

           That hangs in the air. 

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        And I’m going to give it a shot 
                        with him. A real shot.

           Jason hands her the present he got for her.

                                 JASON
                        Happy Birthday.

           EXT. ELLIE’S APARTMENT

           Jason walks sadly out the door. He tugs on the huge dildo and 
           it pops off.

           A homeless guy is begging on the corner, holding out his cup. 
           Jason puts the dildo in the bucket.

                                 JASON
                        Don’t spend it all in one place.

                                 BUM
                        Fuck you.

           INT. JASON’S ROOM - LATER

           Jason sits down in front of his computer and brings up 
           Facebook.

           BLACK.

           CUE: The opening riff of Hendrix’s Purple Haze.

           We come up on Jason’s room.

           What was once neat and orderly has been transformed in to a 
           complete disaster. Coffee cups piled into coffee cups, 
           takeout food containers eating takeout containers.
           He’s on Facebook clicking methodically on picture after 
           picture. This is when Facebook is bad.

                                 JASON
                        Guy with the red hat. Who the fuck 
                        are you? Any more pictures of you?

           He clicks again.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Bingo. Get your hands off her you 
                        dirty creeper. Let’s google you.

           He opens up a new window on the computer.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        William Mathers. Restauranteur. 
                        What a piece of shit this guy is.

           Jason hits print William Mathers’ picture starts feeding out 
           of the printer.

           INT. CEDAR SINAI

           Mikey is walking into the lockers when he sees the Other 
           Doctor.

                                 OTHER DOCTOR
                        Hey Dr. 

                                 MIKEY
                        Hey man. You heading home for 
                        Thankgiving?

                                 OTHER DOCTOR
                        Nah. I’m on all week. You?

                                 MIKEY
                        Staying around the city.

           Mikey jumps onto a computer. Logs on to Facebook. He checks 
           his posting on Vera’s wall. There are numerous comments on 
           the wedding photo he posted.

           CU FACEBOOK COMMENTS: So cute/AWWW/You guys are awesome. 
           Etc...

           Mikey smiles, clicks on LIKE. Then logs off. This is when 
           Facebook is good.
           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           Daniel and Mikey are in the living room. 

                                 DANIEL
                        He’s taken a week off of work.

                                 MIKEY
                        And I know he was supposed to meet 
                        Jack Matterhorn today. That’s a 
                        huge opportunity.

                                 DANIEL
                        We need to get him out of there.

           Daniel knocks on the door just as it flings open. Jason, in a 
           bathrobe, unshaven, comes out of the door. He’s like a zombie 
           as the light hits him for the first time in a while.

                                 JASON
                        I’ve narrowed it down to five guys 
                        that she could be dating.

                                 DANIEL
                        When did Howard Hughes move in?

                                 MIKEY
                        No, that’s just the homeless dude 
                        who killed Jason last week.

           Jason shrugs it off. Keeps going...

                                 JASON
                        Two guys from her masters class at 
                        Chicago recently moved to the city. 
                        One is named George. I met him one 
                        time and he’s a waspy bag of 
                        already sucked cocks. There’s also 
                        this restauranteur who looks like a 
                        real piece of shit. William 
                        something. And one other guy who 
                        isn’t even googleable, which at 
                        this day in age, should be a red 
                        fucking flag and I should probably 
                        go warn her.

                                 DANIEL
                        Seriously man, you look like 
                        somebody Jamie Foxx would play in a 
                        movie.
                                 JASON
                        I’ve started monitoring her 
                        twitter, facebook, and 
                        occasionally, her LinkedIn. I’m 
                        gonna follow her.

                                 DANIEL
                        Dude! That’s a total invasion of 
                        privacy.

                                 JASON
                        It’s public information.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re like one step away from 
                        boiling her pets. 

                                 JASON
                        You’re either with me on this one 
                        or you can get the fuck out of my 
                        apartment.

           Jason scans the faces of his two best friends. He holding the 
           pictures he printed from Facebook in his left, and his drink 
           in his right. He looks fucking crazy.

           EXT. CAFE MOGADOR

           Jason, Daniel, and Mikey stand at a medium distance, on the 
           other side of the street, behind a parked car, drinking 
           coffee and watching.

                                 MIKEY
                        This is insane. We should at least 
                        have disguises.

                                 DANIEL
                        Just relax, Fletch. 

                                 JASON
                        There she is. That’s the guy.

           Across the way, we see Ellie come out of the restaurant. A 
           guy in a baseball hat is with her. He pulls her INTO A KISS.

                                 DANIEL
                        Damnit! I wish we were tough. We 
                        could go kick his ass or whatever.

                                 MIKEY
                        You recognize the guy?
           The guys turns towards us, in SLO MO.

                                 JASON
                        Holy shit...

           As we see the face we recognize...

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        That’s Jack Matterhorn.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        It’s astounding. I love, absolutely 
                        love, your work.

           INT. JACK MATTERHORN’S OFFICE

           Jack Matterhorn sits behind a desk talking to Jason.

                                 JACK MATTERHORN
                        It’s just so fresh and new and has 
                        this energy to it. 

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        You know, one of the other authors 
                        I work with slept with Jack. Said 
                        his dick was like a Pringle can.

           Jason winces.

                                 JASON
                        Thank you. 

                                 JACK MATTERHORN
                        I couldn’t believe that someone 
                        like you has gone unnoticed. I tell 
                        ya, Ellie’s got a great eye.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        Like a Pringle can.

           Jason looks distraught.

                                 JASON
                        She certainly does.

                                 JACK MATTERHORN
                        Look, I want you to be my 
                        illustrator because you’re one of 
                        the most goddamned talented kids 
                        I’ve seen in a long time. And I 
                        mean that.
                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        Pringle can.

           Jason shifts in his chair.

                                 JASON
                        Thank-

                                  ELLIE (V.O.)
                        -Pringle can.

                                 JASON
                        Thank you. That’s really nice.

           Jason is torn between wanting to kill him and accepting his 
           offer, nicely. He shakes Matterhorn’s hand.

                                 JACK MATTERHORN
                        I’m gonna set up a meeting for you 
                        with my publisher - the head of 
                        Ellie’s company. They’ll run you 
                        through the details. And hey, 
                        sometimes you find the breaks, and 
                        sometimes the breaks find you. 

           Jack stands up, offers his hand.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        Like a goddamned Pringle can, 
                        Jason.

                                 JACK MATTERHORN
                        In this case, I think I got a break 
                        finding you. 

           Off Jason looking at Jack’s hand we CUT TO:

           INT. LITTLE BRANCH

           A dark, subterranean speakeasy that serves couture cocktails. 
           Chelsea and Daniel are at the bar. Chelsea clearly wants to 
           talk about something, as she starts, the bartender arrives-

                                 DANIEL
                        This drinks menu is so complicated. 
                        What’s a hot buttered rum?

                                 BARTENDER
                        It’s a velvety, smooth-
                                 DANIEL
                        Nope. Lost you at velvety. I’m not 
                        gonna drink something that has the 
                        same qualities as astroglide. Can I 
                        just have a vodka? Rocks.

                                 CHELSEA
                        What’re you planning for 
                        Thanksgiving this year? 

                                 BARTENDER
                        We have a vodka mint gimlet with 
                        blended egg.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m not drinking an omelette. Just 
                        a vodka.  

                                 BARTENDER
                        Can’t do that.

                                 CHELSEA
                        My parents are having a big dinner 
                        up at their place.

                                 DANIEL
                        Why can’t you make a vodka on the 
                        rocks? You’re a bartender.

                                 BARTENDER
                        I’m a mixologist.

                                 DANIEL
                        Then put a lime in it. 

                                 CHELSEA
                        Remember last year?

                                 DANIEL
                        I do. And I’m still convinced your 
                        mom cheats at scrabble. There’s no 
                        way a woman that drunk gets fucking 
                        quezal.

                                 CHELSEA
                        It’s a bird.

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s a lie, is what it is.

           Chelsea is laughing. The bartender is back.
                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Fine, just something with vodka! 
                        The last time it was this hard to 
                        drink, I was thirteen.

                                 CHELSEA
                        So will you come? 

           Daniel is struggling with this answer. If he goes...then 
           they’re dating.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’ll be there.

           He smiles.

           CU: THE MACY’S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT

           The apartment is a mess. There are about 15 beers on the 
           table. Jason’s drinking a beer and drawing a large, mock up 
           sized drawing. We can’t see it.

           His phone rings.

                                 JASON
                        Yeah. Hi mom. Happy Thanksgiving to 
                        you too. Drunk, no? Just tired. 

           He puts down his drink.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been working on the new 
                        Matterhorn book jacket. Yeah...tell 
                        everyone I say hello...wish I could 
                        be there...

           INT. VERA’S APARTMENT

           A beautiful Thanksgiving table is set. Mikey grabs a bottle 
           of wine from a table in the hallway. He holds it, stops for a 
           moment.

                                 MIKEY
                        The Hot Cold. Pull away just when 
                        she thinks she has you.
           INT. VERA’S APARTMENT

           Mikey has cooked Thanksgiving Dinner for Vera. He’s running 
           to get the last of the meal from the kitchen, frantic - it’s 
           clear he wants everything to be perfect.

                                 MIKEY
                        Okay. That’s everything. Let’s eat.

           She looks up at him, completely sincere. Composes herself.

                                 VERA
                        I want you to know I’m sorry. For 
                        everything I put you through. 
                        Sometimes I’m cold. I’m Hungarian. 
                        That’s what we do. 

                                 MIKEY
                        Vera-

                                 VERA
                        But I can’t think of any place I’d 
                        rather be, or any person I’d rather 
                        be with. I am so lucky to have you.

           Mikey is uncomfortable. He seems to be gathering his resolve. 
           He pushes his chair back from the table.

                                 MIKEY
                        I’m sorry. I can’t do this.

           And he gets up, grabs his coat.

           EXT. VERA’S APARTMENT

           Mikey stands in the hallway, shuts his eyes tight, about to 
           go back.

                                 MIKEY
                        Just walk away. Just walk away. 

           And he walks away from the door.

           INT. BOWERY HOTEL

           Daniel sits at the bar next to a well heeled, yet drunk, 
           gentleman. Some families, walk by, but for the most part, 
           it’s dead.
                                 DANIEL
                        Happy Thanksgiving.

                                 WEALTHY DRUNK
                        It certainly is. I see you escaped 
                        family, too.

                                 DANIEL
                        Just barely.

           The bartender comes by.

                                 WEALTHY DRUNK
                        Two shots of Wild Turkey. It’s 
                        Thanksgiving, after all.

           Daniel gets a text.

           INSERT: CHELSEA: ARE YOU COMING? I KEEP CALLING...

           He puts his phone away. Takes his shot of Turkey, and clinks 
           glasses with the lonely old Drunk.

           INT. MCNALLY JACKSON BOOKSTORE

           Jason is buying ALL of Jack Matterhorn’s books. A CHECKOUT 
           GIRL wearing cool glasses is there.

                                 CHECKOUT GIRL
                        Wow. You’re really into Matterhorn 
                        huh? His new book is supposed to be 
                        amazing.

           She hands him a flyer for a talk at the 92nd St. YMCA.

                                 CHECKOUT GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Everyone’s talking about it. Saying 
                        he’s the next Ellroy.

                                 JASON
                        I’d rather eat my own shit than 
                        read these books. 

                                 CHECKOUT GIRL
                        That’s not...healthy.

                                 JASON
                        Know thy enemy. 

           He points at her as he takes his books.
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Know them to defeat them.

           She walks away.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           Jason walks in with his books. He slumps on the couch as 
           Mikey comes out of him room wheeling a suitcase.

                                 MIKEY
                        She doesn’t want to see me anymore.

                                 JASON
                        What? Slow down. Start from the 
                        beginning.

                                 MIKEY
                        I followed your advice. I pulled 
                        away. I made her feel stupid when I 
                        did it, and I pushed her too far.

                                 JASON
                        She’s made you feel stupid twice 
                        before! That’s the risk you take 
                        trying to get what you want.

                                 MIKEY
                        Risk. That’s the risk? Fuck you 
                        Jason. You don’t take any risks. 
                        Every little thing you do is 
                        designed to protect you. You don’t 
                        want a relationship. You don’t want 
                        to grow up. You’re just afraid to 
                        get hurt because Jenny dumped you 
                        five fucking years ago.

           Jason is fuming.

                                 JASON
                        You wife goes and fucks some dude 
                        because you can’t handle your shit, 
                        and now it’s my fault for trying to 
                        help you?

           Jason has gone too far.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry Mikey.

                                 MIKEY
                        Don’t.
           Mikey goes to the door with his suitcase.

                                 MIKEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re sad Jason. Your life is sad. 
                        And right now, you’re exactly where 
                        you’re supposed to be. Alone.

           Mikey shuts the door.

           INT. JASON’S ROOM

           Lying on the bed, drinking a cocktail from the bedside bar, 
           Jason looks over at his mock-up - we see Matterhorn’s face 
           emblazoned on the side.

           EXT. MADISON AVENUE SHOPS

           Holiday decorations are starting to be hung. It’s a busy, 
           festive time in the city. Electric with shoppers, holiday 
           parties, and goodwill - New York at it’s finest.

           INT. MEDIA WORKS

           Jason and Daniel sit facing Fred’s desk.

                                 JASON
                        Hey look. It’s Fred.

                                 FRED
                        As both of you know we have 
                        incredibly high standards at this 
                        company. Our work generates more 
                        work and so on. Our people 
                        represent us - represent me. And 
                        that’s why this...

           He turns around a mock up book cover. It’s Matterhorn’s The 
           Trial Lawyer. 

           Matterhorn’s face is clearly a GIANT DICK.

                                 DANIEL
                        No you did not.

                                 JASON
                        It still seems appropriate. Even 
                        right now.
                                 FRED
                        I hate to do this during the 
                        holidays, but both of you are 
                        fired. Turning in work like this is 
                        unacceptable.

           Daniel just glares at Jason.

           EXT. MEDIAWORKS - STREET

           Daniel stops Jason outside.

                                 DANIEL
                        What are you doing man?

                                 JASON
                        Job was bullshit anyway.

                                 DANIEL
                        So you have to take me down too?

                                 JASON
                        Without me here you’d be fired 
                        anyway.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’ve completely lost it. All this 
                        over a girl? 

                                 JASON
                        Least I had a girl. Didn’t have to 
                        fuck my best friend.

           Daniel is taken aback.

                                 DANIEL
                        Well, you just did.

           And Daniel walks away. This hurts, but what’s done is done.

           CUE: MUSIC

           *Jason cleans up the massive amount of shit that has amassed 
           in his apartment.

           *Mikey is sleeping on Daniel’s couch.

           *Jason fires up his computer.

           *Jason moves the bar off his side table.

           *He puts together an Ikea bed frame. It’s a start.
           *Jason frames his Carol Alt poster. Also a start.

           *He stands, staring at Mikey’s empty room.

           EXT. VERA’S APARTMENT

           Vera opens the door and sees Jason standing there.

                                 JASON
                        I know we’ve never gotten along, 
                        but there’s something I need to 
                        tell you. 

           INT. VERA’S APARTMENT

           Jason and Vera have coffee.

                                 JASON
                        I told him to do that. I told to 
                        pull away because he’s my best 
                        friend, and you hurt him.

                                 VERA
                        I was feeling vulnerable, and 
                        Harold was just there.

                                 JASON
                        You had sex with a guy named 
                        Harold. I mean, what did you think 
                        was gonna happen?

           She laughs.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I also selfishly liked having my 
                        best friend back. And for that I’m 
                        sorry.

                                 VERA
                        What do you think I should do?

                                 JASON
                        I’m gonna retire early from the 
                        advice business, but I’ll say this - 
                        I’ve never seen him happier than 
                        when he’s with you. He loves you, 
                        Vera. Very much.
           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT

           *Jason draws late into the night on the computer tablet.

           *Jason finishes a book. We see a scene from it. The main 
           character is the superhero Ellie, from Jason’s apology art.

           EXT. ELLIE’S APARTMENT

           Snow is falling in the city. Jason waits for someone to come 
           out, then he slips in. Leaves the book by Ellie’s door.

           MUSIC ENDS as

           EXT. JASON’S BUILDING

           Jason bursts out the front door. A man on a mission. It’s 
           snowing - Manhattan at it’s most alluring. He starts RUNNING. 
           He rounds a corner.

                                 JASON (V.O.)
                        At that moment, I felt only the 
                        need to apologize Daniel and Mikey. 
                        To make things right.

           Jason stops, out of breath.

                                 JASON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But I was also really fucking out 
                        of shape.

           He hails a cab and jumps in.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I need to go to-

           And the cab is BROADSIDED by another car sliding in the snow.

           EXT. WEST VILLAGE STREET

           Tight on Daniel. He’s calling Chelsea, wind whipping through 
           his hair.

                                 DANIEL
                        Chels. Come outside. Please, just 
                        do this for me.

           He hangs up.
           EXT. CHELSEA’S APARTMENT BUILDING

           She exits the front door. Her face lights up.

           REVERSE ON: A DOUBLE DECKER TOURBUS

           Daniel is manning the microphone.

                                 DANIEL
                        Chelsea, please get on the bus. 
                        Everyone, meet Chelsea.

           The crowd of tourists don’t know what else to do, so they all 
           say...

                                 TOURISTS
                        Hiiii, Chelsea.

                                 DANIEL
                        She’s the girl that I love and I, 
                        well, I really screwed it right in 
                        the proverbial crapper. 

           A woman covers her daughter’s ears.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Over the years, you’ve heard it 
                        all, seen it all. Nobody knows me 
                        better than you. And that thought 
                        terrified me.

                                 TOURIST GUY
                        Hey Buddy, what the fuck does this 
                        have to do with New York?

                                 DANIEL
                        Everything. This is New York. This 
                        is people who see each other every 
                        day avoiding actually seeing each 
                        other. That’s what this city is.

                                 TOURIST GUY
                        I don’t get it.

                                 DANIEL
                        Then shut the fuck up for a second, 
                        man, will you? How’s that for New 
                        York?

           The guy stops.
                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        I love you, Chels. Please give me 
                        another shot.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Did you actually get a job on this 
                        bus?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes.

           She runs up to him and hugs him. He drops the mic.

                                 TOURIST GUY
                        Jesus Christ. What is this, Paris?

           Daniel’s phone beeps. A text.

                                 DANIEL
                        Oh no.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY

           The sun sets on the city.

           EXT. CEDAR SINAI

           It glows in the twilight. 

           INT. HOSPITAL

           Jason wakes up in a hospital bed. A nurse is there.

                                 NURSE
                        You feeling okay?

                                 JASON 
                        What happened?

                                 NURSE
                        You got hit by a car. You were just 
                        a little shaken up and you have a 
                        bruise on your head. The doctor 
                        will be in to see you in a moment.

           She grabs some things and heads out. Mikey heads in.

                                 MIKEY
                        Hey.
                                 JASON
                        Shit, Mikey. I wanted to call you. 
                        I’m sorry, man. I know I acted 
                        crazy over the past couple of 
                        months. I don’t know what I was 
                        thinking. I need to apologize.

           Vera suddenly enters the frame.

                                 MIKEY
                        It’s okay. It’s okay. I understand 
                        you were trying to help. 

           Daniel walks in the room.

                                 DANIEL
                        I got here as soon as I could.

                                 JASON
                        Daniel, you cheap piece of shit. 
                        You never bring beer.

                                 DANIEL
                        Someone’s feeling better then?

           Chelsea comes in and stands next to Daniel. She locks his 
           arm. Jason notices.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Daniel told me you inspired him to 
                        apologize.

           Jason looks at Daniel. Understands.

                                 DANIEL
                        Didn’t want to end up like you.

                                 JASON
                        Don’t blame you. How am I doing, 
                        Doctor?

                                 MIKEY
                        Minor concussion and a bruise on 
                        the side of your head. What were 
                        you doing?

                                 JASON
                        I was actually coming to find you 
                        guys. And I guess it worked.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I got so crazy over 
                        Ellie. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I lost myself there for a minute. 
                        I’m happier in the grey area 
                        anyway.

           The others all look at one another.

                                 DANIEL
                        We had to physically drag you off 
                        facebook, you lost your job, became 
                        a stalker, and now you’re just 
                        gonna give up? This is not about 
                        pride, Jason. This is about love.

                                 MIKEY
                        Someone once told me...when you 
                        find the person you’re supposed to 
                        be with...the one who steals all of 
                        your thoughts. The one you fall in 
                        love with...isn’t that worth 
                        fighting for?

           Vera squeezes Mikey’s arm. Jason thinks this over.

                                 JASON
                        You all think I’m should go after 
                        her, don’t you?

           Jason looks at his friends, standing there with their 
           girlfriends. They all simultaneously say.

                                 ALL
                        Yes.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY

           Daniel and Mikey push Jason in his wheelchair to the hospital 
           entrance.

                                 JASON
                        What’s the fastest way to get 
                        there?

                                 DANIEL
                        Rush hour. A cab will take forever.

                                 JASON
                        Subway.

                                 MIKEY
                        To the west village? You’d have to 
                        take the local then change at Union 
                        Square to the E train, then walk a 
                        few blocks. Take forever right now.
           The look over at an EMT wheeling in an old woman. Daniel nods 
           at a Black EMT.

                                 DANIEL
                        Good day sir.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMBULANCE

           The guys are speeding downtown with the sirens blaring.

                                 DANIEL
                        Take 2nd down to Houston and-

                                 EMT
                        I know where the fuck I’m going. I 
                        drive this thing for a living man.

                                 DANIEL
                        Okay. Okay. Roger that.

                                 JASON
                        She’s on 12th and Bleeker.

           EXT. ELLIE’S APARTMENT

           Jason jumps out and starts frantically ringing the bell.

           And he rings as the music SWELLS.

           And SHE’S NOT HOME.

           Jason turns back to the others.

                                 JASON
                        She’s not home.

                                 MIKEY
                        Jesus. We got the EMT and 
                        everything.

                                 DANIEL
                        I mean, you didn’t call her to make 
                        sure she was here?

                                 JASON
                        No.

                                 DANIEL
                        What the fuck were you thinking?
                                 JASON
                        I don’t know. I wasn’t thinking. 
                        Heat of the moment and shit.

           The EMT pokes his head out the window.

                                 EMT
                        She’s not home? Motherfucker! You 
                        didn’t call?

           Jason waves.

                                 JASON
                        Sorry. Sorry. I’ll, uh, I’ll try 
                        her now.

           He looks at the others, phone to his ear.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Not picking up. Damnit. 

           Everyone looks dejected. They walk down the steps, and come 
           face to face with a Matterhorn flyer in a shop window. His 
           book release/reading.

                                 DANIEL
                        That tonight?

                                 JASON
                        Yeah, looks like it. 92nd St. Y.

           INT. AMBULANCE

           The ambulance darts uptown. 

                                 MIKEY
                        You know what you’re gonna say?

                                 JASON
                        Of course I...have no idea.

                                 EMT
                        Here I am drivin you around, and 
                        mothafucka has no idea what he’s 
                        gonna say?

                                 DANIEL
                        This is gonna be awesome.

                                 EMT
                        Gonna be a fuckin failure is what 
                        it’s gonna be.
                                 DANIEL
                        Hey! You’re being a really negative 
                        person right now. 

                                 JASON
                        I know. Criticism is good, but...

                                 MIKEY
                        You gotta come up with some good 
                        shit here Jason. That’s critical.

                                 JASON
                        I know I know. I was just in a car 
                        accident, Jesus. You guys are 
                        really putting the heat on.

           INT. 92ND ST YMCA - BOOK READING

           Classic venue. People everywhere. Excitement.

           Ellie’s setting up the posters for Matterhorn’s book. The new 
           posters are, of course, not designed by Jason.

           Jack is on the stage.

                                 ELLIE
                        I’d like to introduce to you all, 
                        in short order, one of the best 
                        selling authors and foremost 
                        writers of our day. His books have 
                        been turned into four major motion 
                        pictures, he is a guest lecturer at 
                        Columbia University, and his new 
                        effort is called The Law Firm. 
                        Without further ado, Jack 
                        Matterhorn.

                                 MATTERHORN
                        Thank you Ellie. This is a special 
                        day for me. I have all my family 
                        here in the city I adore. I had the 
                        pleasure of working with a new 
                        editor on this book, Simon and 
                        Simon’s newest star Ellie Brown.

           Clapping from the audience as Jason, Daniel and Mikey barge 
           into the room.
                                 MATTERHORN (CONT’D)
                        While she’s not the first editor 
                        who has been ruthless with me, 
                        she’s the first I found attractive 
                        enough to start dating.

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Awwww.

                                 JASON
                        Wait! I love you.

                                 ELLIE
                        Jason? This really isn’t the time.

                                 JASON
                        I need to tell you that I realized 
                        all the things I do to keep me from 
                        being vulnerable, to keep me happy, 
                        are the exact things that are 
                        making me miserable.

                                 MATTERHORN
                        Someone took a wrong turn on the 
                        way to therapy, here.

                                 ELLIE
                        Can we talk about this later?

           Jason looks out, there’s a room PACKED FULL of people 
           watching them.

                                 JASON
                        I love all of the little things 
                        about you. I love the way we fit 
                        together perfectly when we’re lying 
                        in bed. I love you the way you play 
                        with your necklace when you’re 
                        nervous. I love the way you wear my 
                        clothes to bed, and get pissed off 
                        when people use emoticons. And I 
                        could go on an on, but the point 
                        is...The point is I love you.

           Off to the side, Daniel talks to Mikey.

                                 DANIEL
                        Oh shit. He went gay with it.

                                 MIKEY
                        No. This is how it works. Trust me 
                        for once.
                                 MATTERHORN
                        I would have gone with something a 
                        little bigger. Like, you make me 
                        feel like we’re two halves, drawn 
                        together by forces beyond our 
                        control. A magnetism. 

                                 JASON
                             (genuine)
                        Oh that’s good. Magnetism.

                                 MATTERHORN
                        You like that? It’s yours.

                                 JASON
                        Awesome. Thanks.

           A beat.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        You’re rewriting me when I’m trying 
                        to steal your girlfriend? Jesus, 
                        you’re so nice.

                                 MATTERHORN
                        She’s not my girlfriend Jason.

           Ellie hold up her ENGAGEMENT RING.

                                 ELLIE
                        Jack and I got engaged. Today.

           She holds up her ring. Applause from the audience.

           EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE 

           The boys are walking back home, together.

                                 JASON
                        You ever get the feeling that maybe 
                        we aren’t right?

                                 DANIEL
                        I get the feeling you aren’t right 
                        all the time.

                                 JASON
                        That’s not what I mean. That we go 
                        through middle school thinking 
                        we’re right. Then in high school, 
                        we know we’re right. 
                                 MIKEY
                        And we’re validated by these 
                        prestigious institutions of higher 
                        learning accepting us.

                                 JASON
                        Yes. The whole fucking thing exists 
                        to confirm that you’re right. And 
                        you’ve got no choice but to believe 
                        them.

                                 DANIEL
                        Because you want to believe them.

                                 JASON
                        And then you get into the world and 
                        there’s no playbook. There’s no 
                        right. No wrong. Just decisions.

           Jason has stopped. Daniel and Mikey follow suit.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        And it never dawned on us that 
                        maybe, just maybe, we don’t have 
                        all the answers. Maybe we can fuck 
                        things up and change the course of 
                        our lives. Because maybe we don’t 
                        understand relationships. Maybe we 
                        don’t understand ourselves.

           They all stand there, silent. Sizing each other up. It starts 
           to snow.

           INT. ELLIE’S APARTMENT

           She looks at the book Jason left for her. On the cover is 
           JASON AND ELLIE as SUPERHEROES. They’re making out. And a 
           note.

           INSERT: I’m asking you to judge this book by it’s cover.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Jason opens his door. Alana, the young actress, is there. 
           She’s wrapped up in a scarf and carrying a large purse. She’s 
           appropriately disheveled, and now has short hair.

                                 ALANA
                        It’s been a long time. I thought 
                        you’d died.
                                 JASON
                        You cut your hair.

                                 ALANA
                        I got that part.

                                 JASON
                        And how’d it go?

                                 ALANA
                        We got extended at the Public. Now 
                        extend me an invitation inside.

           Jason fully opens the door.

           INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Jason is sitting next to her, they each have a drink. She 
           puts hers down, and starts unbuttoning her shirt.

                                 ALANA
                        I figure you might just be my good 
                        luck charm.

                                 JASON
                        It’s good to see you.

           She drops her shirt.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        It’s better to see you.

           Jason is looking at her. She’s beautiful. She wiggles out of 
           her pants, sits across from him. Her arms on his legs.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I know this is strange, and I feel 
                        like, well, I feel like a woman 
                        turning down sex like this.

           He hands her the pants she’s hastily removed.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        But I’m not ready. I’m not over my 
                        ex.

                                 ALANA
                        You make me come all the way over 
                        here and then you decide you can’t 
                        do this?
           She grabs her pants and then starts putting them on. As she 
           does, she gets more angry.

                                 JASON
                        You might be my good luck charm, 
                        but you’re a selfish fucking prick. 
                        I mean, what kind of-

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT - LIVINGROOM - LATER

           Jason sits on the couch, looking at his drawings of superhero 
           Ellie. He sees Alana’s purse, just as there’s a LOUD KNOCK on 
           the door. He’s startled.

                                 JASON
                        Yeah, I know, I know! 

           He grabs the bag, opens the door, and holds it out.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        You left this-

           It’s Ellie. 

                                 ELLIE
                        I broke up with Jack. I don’t care 
                        what you say, I can’t stop thinking 
                        about you, and what you said 
                        earlier.

           She just kisses him, full on the mouth. 

                                 JASON
                        I-

                                 ELLIE
                        Don’t make a joke. Just let me say 
                        the things I need to say...

           Jason nods.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        All the things you set up in your 
                        life to keep people like me away, I 
                        can see through them. 

                                 JASON
                        I was falling in love with you and 
                        it scared the shit out of me. I 
                        want to date you properly, Ellie. 
                                 ELLIE
                        I want that too. Whatever that 
                        means.

           Jason considers this. They both start grinning. They know 
           what’s coming.

                                 JASON
                        It means I want to convince you to 
                        have sex somewhere special, like an 
                        ice rink or a sleigh ride. 

                                 ELLIE
                        I want to compare you favorably to 
                        my ex lovers. But only to your 
                        face.

                                 JASON
                        I want to wake up next to you on 
                        mornings I’m not still drunk.

                                 ELLIE
                        I want to pretend I like your body.

                                 JASON
                        I want to pretend I like my body-

                                 ELLIE
                        -who’s purse is that?

           Jason realizes he’s holding Alana’s purse..

                                 JASON
                        What? Oh. Hmmm. That’s an 
                        interesting story.

           Alana comes around the corner.

                                 ALANA
                        I left my purse. (to Ellie) Good 
                        luck. This asshole (whiny) isn’t 
                        over his ex.

           She snatches her purse.

                                 ALANA (CONT’D)
                        Lose my number.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT

           Jason and Ellie finish having sex. Jason reaches into the 
           bedside table. He pulls out the Gramercy Park key.
                                 JASON
                        I think you can have this back.

                                 ELLIE
                        Aww. This is the nicest thing 
                        anybody’s ever stolen for me.

                                 JASON
                        I think that was the first time 
                        we’ve done it as...as a couple.

           She nods at him, perhaps recalling the time they’ve spent 
           getting to this moment.

                                 ELLIE
                        A couple? Fuck that. You owe me a 
                        thousand dollars. Did I not tell 
                        you I was a hooker?
