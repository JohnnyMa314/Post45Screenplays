                       my heart also. I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed. Looking Glass is 
                       dead. Toohoolhoolzote is dead. The old men are all dead. My brother, 
                       Ollokot, is dead. It is cold and we have no blankets. The little children are 
                       freezing to death. Hear me, My Chiefs! My heart is sick and sad. From where 
                       the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever."

           FADE IN:

           EXT. NORTHERN MONTANA - LATE AFTERNOON

           A gentle wind blows, swaying an ocean of tall grass across 
           the undulating hills of the endless Montana plains.

           This is epic landscape. Vast and empty, except for a distant, 
           moving shadow...which we soon recognize as an approaching 
           rider coming towards us on a galloping horse.

           LT. JAMES BRADLEY (33) stops for a brief rest. He wears the 
           uniform of a union soldier. It seems strange that he’d be out 
           here all by himself. But we can tell, from the look in his 
           eyes, that he’s searching for something. But what?

           Bradley checks his compass, then charges on ahead...

           EXT. NORTHERN MONTANA - LATER

           Bradley glides across the terrain, a spec in God’s country. 

           And then he brings his horse to a sudden stop. 

           The wind blows. His eyes narrow. Something is terribly wrong.

           Bradley nudges his horse forward. And then we see it, too...

           There is a DEAD BODY in the grass up ahead. 

           Flayed with arrows. Lying in a pool of dried blood. And 
           wearing a uniform just like Bradley’s. Bradley dismounts. 

           He turns the corpse over and recoils at the ghastly sight. 
           The body is mutilated. Eyes gouged. Throat cut. Head scalped.

           Bradley gets back on his horse and rides towards the clearing 
           up ahead, terrified of what he’s about to discover...

           Hundreds of bodies are strewn across the landscape. As far as 
           the eye can see. On ground soaked red with blood.

           This is unbelievable slaughter. An entire calvary unit 
           annihilated, the bodies desecrated and unrecognizable. 

           Genitals have been ripped from one corpse and shoved down the 
           throat of another. Heads are severed and placed on pikes.

           Overwhelmed, Bradley doubles over and vomits. Wretching. 
           Gasping. Fighting to catch his breath. Bradley suddenly hears 
           something. Distant movement. He slowly looks up...

           A WHITE HORSE stands on the other side of the battlefield. 
           Covered in blood. Impaled with arrows. But alive.
           Bradley rides over to the horse and strokes its mane, hoping 
           somehow that the animal’s haunted eyes will tell him the 
           story of what happened here.

           Those familiar with history know where we are. Others will 
           find out soon enough. And as Lt. James Bradley takes in the 
           epic carnage just south of the Little Big Horn River, we hear 
           the overlapping sound of a sudden, shrieking TRAIN WHISTLE...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN FOREST - MORNING

           ...A MIGHTY ELK looks up at a distant plume of smoke rising off 
           the far horizon. The Union Pacific Railroad.

           Weighing nearly a thousand pounds, surrounded by lush forest 
           high in the mountains, the elk stares at the valley far 
           below, regarding the smoke with curiosity...

           Something stirs in the forest. 

           The elk tightens, sensing danger...and then it takes off, 
           fleeing deep into the woods... 

           But it’s too late. Arrows come flying from every direction. 
           The elk crashes to the ground. Dead.

           For a moment, the forest stands completely still...and then 
           TWENTY NEZ PERCE WARRIORS step out from the timber. 

           They surround their kill, smiling proudly, patting each other 
           on the back. These are all men we will come to know well... 

           YELLOW WOLF and WAHLITS have just recently come of age. They 
           approach the animal like kids on Christmas. 

           Wahlits’ father, EAGLE ROCK, stares down at the giant animal.

           (Note: Except when otherwise specified, Nez Perce characters 
           will speak in their native language with subtitles.)

                                 EAGLE ROCK
                        Not bad for your first time.

           Wahlits nods as TOOHOOLHOOLZOTE (50) steps into view...

                                 TOOHOOLHOOLZOTE
                        Your son nearly cost us the elk, 
                        Eagle Rock. It was his noise that 
                        scared it away...
                             (To Yellow Wolf)
                        And you...your arrows missed wide. 
                        You need practice.

           BLACK OWL (25) comes to the boys’ defense.
                                 BLACK OWL
                        And what do you need, 
                        Toohoolhoolzote?

                                 TOOHOOLHOOLZOTE
                        A younger pair of legs. That climb 
                        nearly killed me!

           Laughter as the other men gather around... 

           OLLOKOT (33) steps forward with his brother...JOSEPH (37). 

           Joseph is their leader, their chief. We sense his seniority 
           in the way others look to him for approval.

           Joseph looks down at the elk as Ollokot kneels and offers a 
           prayer for the animal’s sacrifice. Heads bow in reverence.

           But as the prayer continues, another distant train whistle is 
           heard. Joseph looks up at the far away smoke. Somewhere deep 
           in his soul, he knows what that train means for his people...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Returning warriors emerge from the forest and approach a 
           HUNDRED TIPIS scattered along the hillside. 

           Children see their fathers coming and run to them. Women 
           greet their husbands. There is much joy in this village. 

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - SUNSET

           The rosy sunset ripples the sky with shades of pink as the 
           tribe gathers around dozens of roaring fires to eat dinner.  

           YOUNG CHILDREN play while the adults laugh and talk. It’s a 
           beautiful evening. Everyone seems happy. 

           Joseph sits with his wife, SPRINGTIME, and his daughter, 
           NOISE OF RUNNING FEET (11). 

           Ollokot sits beside his wife FAIRLAND.

           Black Owl has his arm around his wife OYEMA, who is nine 
           months pregnant. She suddenly jumps.

                                 BLACK OWL
                        He’s moving again?

           Oyema smiles and places his hands on her belly. The proud 
           parents-to-be laugh as the baby kicks again...

           Joseph watches them with a slight smile. 
           Nearby, Yellow Wolf sits with his mother, SWAN LACE. On the 
           other side of their FIRE, Eagle Rock sits with Wahlits...

                                 EAGLE ROCK
                        It’s getting warmer. Soon, we will 
                        not need so many fires.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        I like the fires.

                                 EAGLE ROCK
                        For you, Swan Lace, we will keep 
                        them going through summer.

           Swan Lace smiles. Eagle Rock turns to Wahlits and finds his 
           son fixated on a beautiful young sitting a few fires down. 

           Her name is LITTLE BIRD. She suddenly looks his way. 

           Nervous, Wahlits quickly averts his gaze. 

           Yellow Wolf shakes his head with a slight smile.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - DUSK

           YOUNG MEN of the tribe assemble to play STICKBALL as the last 
           light of day begins to fade with the approaching night.

           They divide into two teams and are about to begin when 
           Toohoolhoolzote comes onto the field. 

           He is greeted with howls of laughter. But the game begins and 
           the aging warrior quickly proves he belongs on the field...

           This is a brutal game. Full contact sport. Bodies collide and 
           collapse to the earth. Cuts. Scrapes. Bruises. Blood. 

           Women and children stand nearby, cheering the athletes. 

           Yellow Wolf and Wahlits advance the ball down the field... 
           They’re about to score when Ollokot intercepts...

           Ollokot hurls the ball to Toohoolhoolzote, who charges down 
           the field and passes it to Black Owl...

           Black Owl scores a goal! Oyema applauds. Everyone cheers... 

           But, then, suddenly...Oyema doesn’t look so good. She grabs 
           her stomach...her WATER BREAKS and hits the ground.

           The OLD WOMEN of the tribe quickly whisk Oyema away. 

           Black Owl drops his stick and runs after them...
           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The old women escort Oyema through the village and disappear 
           inside a tipi. The last woman turns and holds up her hand... 

           Black Owl stops dead in his tracks.

           The old woman goes inside the tipi, leaving Black Owl alone 
           and overwhelmed as any soon-to-be father would be.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Fairland walks at a brisk pace, clearly in a hurry. Ollokot, 
           passing her, grabs her by the arm...

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Where are you rushing off to?

           He pulls her close, playfully. She struggles. 

                                 FAIRLAND
                        Let go of me, you fool! My sister 
                        is having a child!

                                 OLLOKOT
                        They have enough women. Stay with 
                        me. Your husband has needs.

                                 FAIRLAND
                        Your needs can wait.

           She shakes loose from his grip and walks away...

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Fairland! I’ll be waiting...

           Fairland looks back at her husband and smiles suggestively 
           before disappearing from view. 

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Overwhelmed, Black Owl sits down and crosses his legs.

           Fairland approaches -- she glances down at Black Owl, then 
           goes inside the tipi where her sister is giving birth.

           Black Owl takes a deep breath and settles in for a long wait.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - GAME FIELD - LATER

           Grey dusk has turned to black night. 

           Toohoolhoolzote stands in the now empty field, mourning the 
           loss of his beloved game. He hears distant horse hooves O.S. 
           RED GRIZZLY, a fierce warrior, rides into the village on an 
           APPALOOSA HORSE whose thundering hooves shake the ground. 

           Toohoolhoolzote watches from a distance, concerned.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Wahlits and Yellow Wolf watch as Red Grizzly dismounts.

                                 WAHLITS
                        He came back...

           Red Grizzly seems agitated; his demeanor suggests he has big 
           news. TRIBE ELDERS surround him and urge him to calm down...

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        Let’s get closer...

           Wahlits nods, but then something else catches his eye... 

           Little Bird. Coming out of her tipi. Walking away from the 
           village towards the nearby FOREST. BEAT.

                                 YELLOW WOLF (CONT’D)
                        Go.

           Wahlits nods ‘thank you’ and takes off after Little Bird...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Joseph walks home with his wife and daughter. He notices the 
           commotion surrounding Red Grizzly. Concerned, he turns to 
           Springtime, who already knows what he’s about to say...

                                 JOSEPH
                        I won’t be long.

           Springtime nods. Joseph turns and approaches the group. 
           Everyone sees him coming and stops talking. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        What is going on here?

                                 OLLOKOT
                             (To Red Grizzly)
                        Tell Joseph what you just told us. 

           Red Grizzly hesitates, then nods. He turns to face Joseph... 

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Yellow Hair is dead.

           Joseph flinches. This is staggering news. Nearby, Yellow Wolf 
           eavesdrops, stunned by what he’s heard. 
                                 JOSEPH
                        By whose hand?

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Sitting Bull. 

                                 TOOHOOLHOOLZOTE (O.S.)
                        It can’t be true... 

           Everyone turns. Toohoolhoolzote steps forward.

                                 TOOHOOLHOOLZOTE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t believe it...

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Believe what you want. I spoke with 
                        a Lakota warrior who was there...
                        Yellow Hair crossed the river of 
                        greasy grass and attacked their 
                        village at dawn. Sitting Bull’s 
                        warriors killed them all...to the 
                        last man! Put them in the ground 
                        and buried them in their own blood!

           Everyone listens quietly. Nobody says a word. 

           Joseph glances back at the Nez Perce village. People come and 
           go with smiles and laughter. We see in his face what Joseph 
           already knows: this news would shatter their peace.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I ask you not to bring this news 
                        into our village, now.

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        But people should know! This is a 
                        great thing that has happened--!

                                 OLLOKOT
                             (Interrupting)
                        Red Grizzly. Do as you’re told.

           Red Grizzly bites his tongue and leaves.

           EXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           Little Bird stares up at the jeweled sky. Wahlits sneaks up 
           behind her. She jumps, realizes it’s him...and smiles.

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        You scared me!

           She hits him playfully and they both laugh. He takes her in 
           his arms and tries to kiss her. She leans back, resisting... 
                                 LITTLE BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I can’t. If I’m gone too long my 
                        mother will come looking for me...

                                 WAHLITS
                        It won’t take long...

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        That’s what you said last time...

           The memory brings a smile to his face. 

                                 WAHLITS
                        Wait for her to fall asleep. Meet 
                        me back here in one hour. 

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        No, I can’t...

                                 WAHLITS
                        Understand, Little Bird, I can’t 
                        let you go until you say ‘yes’.

           She struggles to get away and laughs when he won’t let go. 
           Then she looks deep into his eyes. They’re in-love.

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        One hour?

           Wahlits nods, then slowly releases her. They stand before 
           each other, neither wanting to part ways. 

           Wahlits puts something in her hands. She looks down. 

           A BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE. Hand crafted. Little Bird smiles and 
           then forces herself to head back to the village.

           INT. JOSEPH’S TIPI - MOMENTS LATER

           Joseph enters to find Springtime packing and Noise of Running 
           Feet reluctantly climbing into bed. 

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        What was that about?

                                 JOSEPH
                             (Hesitates)
                        Nothing. Red Grizzly’s just 
                        agitated with wild stories...
                             (To Noise of Running Feet)
                        Ready for bed?

                                 NOISE OF RUNNING FEET
                        I need Hermene...!
           Joseph picks a DOLL up off the floor and hands it to her. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Now get some sleep. We have a long 
                        day of travel tomorrow.

                                 NOISE OF RUNNING FEET
                        Will we be home soon?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes.

                                 NOISE OF RUNNING FEET
                        I hate traveling. Why do we have to 
                        leave every winter?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Because Wallowa is too cold in the 
                        winter. The hunting is bad.

                                 NOISE OF RUNNING FEET
                        Then why do we stay there at all?

           Joseph thinks for a moment.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Long ago, before there were people, 
                        there were animals. And a terrible 
                        monster, who began to eat the 
                        animals. And one day, the coyote, 
                        who was very clever, realized that 
                        the monster had eaten all the 
                        animals except for him. So the 
                        coyote found the monster and said, 
                        “I do not wish to live alone. Here 
                        I am. Do what you will.” So the 
                        monster ate the coyote, as well.

           Springtime watches Joseph tell the story, smiling.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        But the clever coyote had hidden 
                        knives on his body. And when the 
                        monster ate him, the coyote climbed 
                        all the way down the monster’s 
                        throat and gave the knives to the 
                        animals who were trapped there. The 
                        rattlesnake. The bear. The elk and 
                        the deer. And together, they found 
                        the monster’s heart and cut it out. 
                        The monster fell down dead! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        And the animals burst from his body 
                        and thanked the coyote for their 
                        freedom. And do you know what the 
                        coyote did then?

           Noise of Running Feet shakes her head.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        He carved up the monster and gave 
                        his body to different areas of the 
                        earth. Towards the sunrise and the 
                        sunset; towards the north and the 
                        south. And where each part landed, 
                        the coyote named a tribe and 
                        described what their appearance 
                        would be. And so, the Cayuse were 
                        formed and became small and hot 
                        tempered. The Coeur d’Alene became 
                        skillful gamblers. The Flatheads 
                        and the Blackfeet...well, that’s 
                        obvious, now, isn’t it? 

           Noise of Running Feet giggles. Springtime smiles, too.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        But then, the fox said to the 
                        coyote, “What is the meaning of 
                        this? You have given the monster’s 
                        body to far away lands, but you 
                        have given nothing to this land.
                             (Beat)
                        And so, the Coyote took the blood 
                        of the monster and sprinkled it 
                        over the land. And from this blood 
                        came the Nu-me-poo; the Nez Perce. 
                             (Beat)
                        And we have lived there ever since.

           Noise of Running Feet slowly comes to a realization:

                                 NOISE OF RUNNING FEET
                        So...the land belongs to us?

           Joseph smiles, then kisses her gently on the cheek. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        No...we belong to the land.
                             (Beat)
                        Get some sleep.

           Noise of Running Feet closes her eyes.
           EXT. FOREST’S EDGE - LATER

           Yellow Wolf shoots ARROWS at a TARGET. Swan Lace approaches.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        What are you doing?

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        Practicing. My arrows miss wide.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        Can you even see what you’re 
                        shooting at?

           Yellow Wolf fires. The arrow disappears into the dark woods.

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                             (Being hard on himself)
                        Does it matter?

                                 SWAN LACE
                        Where’s Wahlits?

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        He had somewhere else to be.

                                 SWAN LACE
                             (Smiles)
                        Who is she?

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        Can’t say. It’s a secret.

           Swan Lace nods, smiling. She turns to leave...

                                 YELLOW WOLF (CONT’D)
                        I heard Joseph talking with the 
                        elders, earlier. 
                             (Beat)
                        They killed Yellow Hair.

           Swan Lace turns back, unsettled.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        Who?

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        Sitting Bull.

           Swan Lace hesitates, not sure what to say.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        Don’t stay out too late.
           She turns and heads back to the village. 

           Yellow Wolf pulls back his bow and lets another arrow fly.

           INT. LITTLE BIRD’S TIPI - SAME TIME

           Little Bird is wide awake listening to her mother snore. She 
           finally gets the courage to stand up and leave... 

           Her mother’s snoring suddenly stops.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Little Bird. Where are you going?

           Caught, Little Bird slowly turns back.

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        I thought I heard something.

                                 MOTHER
                        You heard nothing. Go to sleep.

           Little Bird returns to bed. Missing Wahlits already.

           EXT. NEARBY FOREST - LATER

           Wahlits stands alone and realizes Little Bird is not coming. 
           He turns and walks deeper into the forest... 

           Up ahead, Wahlits hears VOICES. Hushed, excited whispers...

                                 RED GRIZZLY (O.S.)
                        Joseph is an idiot. He’d rather die 
                        than stand up and fight. Sitting 
                        Bull has just proven the white man 
                        can be defeated... 

           SNAP! Wahlits steps on a branch. The talking stops. 

                                 RED GRIZZLY (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

           Wahlits comes out from the shadows. Everyone relaxes.

                                 YOUNG WARRIOR
                        It’s just Wahlits. He’s harmless.

           Red Grizzly stares at Wahlits for a moment. BEAT.

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Where’s your girl?

                                 WAHLITS
                        She never came. Her mother...
                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Old hag. Worthless woman. You 
                        should stand up to her.

           Red Grizzly approaches and offers Wahlits a BOTTLE.

                                 WAHLITS
                        What’s this?

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Just drink.

           Wahlits takes a sip and nearly gags. Everyone laughs. 

                                 WAHLITS
                        What is that?

           Red Grizzly takes back the bottle.

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Whiskey. A white man gave it to me.

                                 WAHLITS
                        A white man? Where?!

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        What do you mean, where? They’re 
                        all over. You don’t have to go too 
                        far to find one.
                             (more laughter, then)
                        Want another?

           Wahlits hesitates, then steps forward and takes the bottle. 
           Drunken laughter fills the woods.

           INT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - LATER

           The village is quiet and still. Everyone is asleep. 

           Except for Black Owl. Still sitting on the ground, legs 
           crossed, focused on the tipi where Oyema is giving birth.

           Fairland comes outside. She smiles, then steps aside. 

           Black Owl leaps to his feet and charges into the tipi.

           INT. JOSEPH’S TIPI - MOMENTS LATER

           Shouts of celebration awaken Joseph and Springtime. 

           Joseph gets to his feet and peers outside...

           Black Owl is running through the village with a NEW BORN BABY 
           in his arms. NEZ PERCE MEN surround him in celebration.
                                 BLACK OWL
                        My son! I have a son!

           Joseph watches, smiling. Springtime comes over, as well.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Black Owl is a father.

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        I can’t think of a better way to 
                        start the year.

           Joseph puts his arm around her. They go back inside.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. FOREST - AFTERNOON

           The NEZ PERCE TRIBE is on the move, heading home. 800 MEN, 
           WOMEN, and CHILDREN comprise a moving train, stretching for 
           miles, with broken-down TIPIS, HORSES, MULES, and LIVESTOCK.

           Joseph and Ollokot are in the lead. Noise of Running Feet 
           rides with Joseph like a cherished daughter. 

           Springtime and Fairland ride together and talk.

           Nearby, Black Owl and Oyema ride side by side, unable to take 
           their eyes off of their NEWBORN SON.

           Wahlits glances back at Little Bird. She’s wearing the 
           necklace he gave her. He smiles.

           The tribe keeps moving...

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - AFTERNOON

           The tribe comes over a hill, revealing a distant ridge that 
           marks their homeland. Toohoolhoolzote is the first to notice.

                                 TOOHOOLHOOLZOTE
                        Wallowa!

           The tribe cheers. They’re home. WARRIORS ride ahead...

           They reach the ridge and suddenly stop. 

           Joseph can tell something is wrong. He kicks his horse. 
           Ollokot follows close behind...

           Joseph and Ollokot reach the ridge and stare down at the 
           valley below...their faces tighten with profound concern.
           EXT. WALLOWA VALLEY - LATER

           Joseph and Ollokot cautiously lead the tribe into the valley. 
           Everyone seems quiet and fearful. And we quickly see why...

           Wallowa is overrun with WHITE SETTLERS and MINERS.

           While the Nez Perce tribe was away, an entire community 
           sprang up in their absence. And now a standoff ensues as the 
           Nez Perce return to the valley of their ancestors...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. GENERAL HOWARD’S HOUSE - MORNING

           GENERAL OLIVER O. HOWARD (44), a one-armed Civil War veteran, 
           struggles to button his coat. His wife, ELIZABETH, enters. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Let me help with you that...

           She stands close to her husband and does them one at a time. 
           Tender and loving. She looks deep into his eyes.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        You’ll do fine.

           Howard nods and slowly exhales. He’s clearly nervous. BEAT.

           INT. / EXT. HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE - LATER

           General Howard stares out the window as the horse-drawn 
           carriage whisks him down the streets of Washington, D.C. 

           A much different place in 1877. Dirt roads lead to the White 
           House. Horses trot down K Street instead of cars.

           NEWSPAPER STANDS nearby and all around show pictures of 
           GENERAL GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER front and center. 

           Giant bold headlines read: “MASSACRE AT LITTLE BIG HORN.”

           INT. SHERMAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           GENERAL WILLIAM T. SHERMAN (57) sits behind his desk going 
           through a mountain of paperwork. A CORPORAL enters.

                                 CORPORAL
                        General Howard to see you, sir?

                                 SHERMAN
                        Show him in, please.

           Sherman stands and crosses the room as Howard enters.
                                 SHERMAN (CONT’D)
                        Oliver. Great to see you. How long 
                        has it been?

                                 HOWARD
                        Since Georgia.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Right. Have a seat. Can I offer you 
                        anything? Cigar? Brandy?

                                 HOWARD
                        No. Thank you.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Been reading the papers? Nothing 
                        but heartache these days...

           Sherman sits down. Howard hesitates, then says--

                                 HOWARD
                        I’m sorry about George, sir. I know 
                        he was a friend of yours.

           Sherman nods, faintly. Then: 

                                 SHERMAN
                        What do you know about the Nez 
                        Perce Indians, Oliver?

                                 HOWARD
                             (Shrugs)
                        Not much. Kept Lewis and Clark from 
                        starving to death, didn’t they?

           Sherman motions to a FILE resting on the table...

                                 SHERMAN
                        That’s for you.
                             (As Howard opens the file)
                        Are you familiar with the Whitman 
                        massacre? Men, women, and children 
                        brutally murdered with pipe 
                        tomahawks - if that’s your idea of 
                        not hostile, then you’ve got a 
                        different definition than I do.

                                 HOWARD
                        That was thirty years ago.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Yeah? How long ago did Lewis and 
                        Clark run into their trouble?
           Sherman stands and walks over to a LARGE MAP of the WALLOWA 
           VALLEY hanging on the far wall. Howard leans forward.

                                 SHERMAN (CONT’D)
                        In 1863, a Nez Perce Chief sold the 
                        entire Wallowa Valley to the United 
                        States Government. Now, there was 
                        contention among certain groups of 
                        Indians regarding the legality of 
                        the sale. So, a compromise was 
                        reached. The valley was divided in 
                        half. The western half was opened 
                        for settlement while the eastern 
                        half was ceded back to the non-
                        treaty Nez Perce who refused to 
                        assimilate into civilized society. 
                        In the fifteen years since that 
                        controversy, roughly half of the 
                        Nez Perce Nation has adopted white 
                        man’s ways. They go to school. They 
                        attend church. They look towards 
                        the future while the other half, 
                        the non-treaty Indians, led by 
                        Chief Joseph, cling to the past.
                             (Turns to face Howard)
                        In 1873, President Grant issued an 
                        executive order reaffirming that 
                        half of the Wallowa Valley was to 
                        be reserved specifically for the 
                        non-treaty Nez Perce. 
                             (Dramatic Beat)
                        That order has been overturned.

                                 HOWARD
                        As of when?

                                 SHERMAN
                        As of this morning. 

           Howard isn’t sure what to say. Sherman crosses the room and 
           sits down. He looks Howard straight in the eye.

                                 SHERMAN (CONT’D)
                        Your orders are to proceed directly 
                        to the Wallowa Valley, where you 
                        will rendezvous with Captain David 
                        Perry, and...escort the Nez Perce 
                        tribe onto the neighboring 
                        reservation at Lapwai. 

                                 HOWARD
                        And if they refuse to be moved?
                                 SHERMAN
                        Then you will move them by force. 
                        Using any means necessary.

           Howard looks at Sherman. BEAT.

                                 HOWARD
                        For Custer?

                                 SHERMAN
                             (With resolve)
                        This country has endured enough 
                        bloodshed to last two lifetimes. 
                        There can not be another Little Big 
                        Horn. It’s that simple.

                                 HOWARD
                        Yes, sir.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Good to see you again, Oliver.

           Sherman stands, indicating their meeting is over. He pats 
           Howard on the back, then returns to his desk. 

           Howard stands and goes to the door -- something clearly on 
           his mind. About to leave, he stops and turns back...

                                 HOWARD
                        I don’t suppose this has anything 
                        to do with the gold that was 
                        discovered out there last winter?

           Sherman stops working. He slowly looks up at Howard.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Now, I thought you said you didn’t 
                        read the newspapers. 
                             (Beat)
                        Do me a favor, Oliver, close the 
                        door on your way out, alright?

           Sherman returns to his work. Howard stares at him for a 
           lingering moment, then slowly shuts the door.

           EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - LATER

           Howard comes outside and buys a newspaper.  Everyone on the 
           crowded street is reading about Little Big Horn... 

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        Oliver?!

           Howard looks up to see COL. NELSON A. MILES (38) approaching.
                                 HOWARD
                        Nelson!

           The two men embrace. 

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MILES
                        Seeing the old man in half an hour. 

                                 HOWARD
                        I just came from there.

                                 MILES
                        I figured. Can I buy you a drink?

                                 HOWARD
                        You can buy me coffee.

                                 MILES
                        Oh, God, you’re still religious?

                                 HOWARD
                        Afraid so.

           Miles laughs and puts an arm around Howard. They cross the 
           street and approach a nearby TAVERN.

           INT. TAVERN - LATER

           Shot of whiskey for Miles. Cup of black coffee for Howard. 
           The WAITRESS smiles and leaves the two men alone.

                                 MILES
                        I thought, maybe...the war had 
                        tempered your convictions.

                                 HOWARD
                        It strengthened them.

           Miles picks up his whiskey. Howard, his coffee. 

           They toast and drink. Miles glances at Howard’s newspaper. 
           Custer is the elephant in the room.

                                 MILES
                        Last I heard, you were running that 
                        Negro University in New York?

                                 HOWARD
                        That’s right.
                                 MILES
                        Even managed to name it after 
                        yourself, eh?

           Howard smiles, then decides to change the subject.

                                 HOWARD
                        I was sorry to hear about the 
                        promotion. Being a general’s 
                        overrated.

                                 MILES
                        I’ll have to take your word for it.

                                 HOWARD
                        Seen anybody else we know?

                                 MILES
                        Are you kidding? It’s like a 
                        goddamn West Point reunion. 
                        Everyone’s being dispatched to the 
                        frontier. Where they sending you?

                                 HOWARD
                        Wallowa.

                                 MILES
                        Flatheads?

                                 HOWARD
                        Nez Perce.

                                 MILES
                        Oh, you got a good assignment. Nice 
                        and easy. Sherman always liked you. 
                        I married his niece and he’ll 
                        probably send me after the goddamn 
                        Sioux Nation.

                                 HOWARD
                        What do you mean?

                                 MILES
                        What do I mean? Don’t you see the 
                        writing on the wall? We’re hitting 
                        the Indians full force. Big Horn’s 
                        changed everything. What happens 
                        when the different tribes join 
                        forces and we have an all out 
                        Indian War? Cause you know that’s 
                        what they’re thinking. Christ, 
                        could you imagine? I don’t know 
                        about you, Oliver, but I had my 
                        fill during the last great war.
                                 HOWARD
                        Yeah. Me, too.

           Howard sips his coffee, deep in thought.

           EXT. LAPWAI SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

           The school sits at the end of a town inhabited by MINERS and 
           MISSIONARIES and NEZ PERCE INDIANS who have converted to 
           Christianity and adopted white man’s ways.

           Joseph watches as dozens of NEZ PERCE CHILDREN, dressed in 
           white man’s clothing, pour out of the building...

           INT. LAPWAI SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           REBECCA FULLER (37) helps a NEZ PERCE STUDENT with his 
           homework. The door opens. She looks up. BEAT.

           Joseph stands across the room, reluctant to approach. 

                                 REBECCA
                             (To student)
                        Let’s continue tomorrow. Alright?

           The student nods and leaves the room... 

           Rebecca looks at Joseph, but before she can say anything, 
           AGENT ROBERT MONTIETH (40) bursts into the classroom...

                                 MONTIETH
                        Miss Fuller! I’ve just heard Chief 
                        Joseph’s been spotted in town...

                                 REBECCA
                        I know...

                                 MONTIETH
                        I think it’d be best if I escorted 
                        you home right away...
                             (Suddenly realizes)
                        Wait, how do you know?

           Rebecca nods over his shoulder. Montieth slowly turns. He 
           sees Joseph and turns white as a ghost...

                                 MONTIETH (CONT’D)
                        What does he want?

                                 REBECCA
                        I don’t know.

                                 MONTIETH
                        I’ll stay with you until he leaves.
                                 JOSEPH
                             (Broken English)
                        That won’t be necessary. I mean 
                        Miss Fuller no harm. And you have 
                        my word I will not stay long.

           Montieth looks at Joseph -- shocked. 

                                 MONTIETH
                        You speak English?

                                 REBECCA
                        Robert...Joseph and I went to 
                        school together here in Lapwai. 
                        Many years ago. It’s alright.

                                 MONTIETH
                        You’re sure?
                             (Rebecca nods)
                        Alright, then...

           Rebecca follows Montieth to the door and watches it shut 
           behind him. Joseph slowly approaches...

                                 JOSEPH
                        I do not wish to bring you 
                        trouble...

           She suddenly turns around and gives him a tender hug. And in 
           this moment, we sense deep friendship. And a shared past. 

           Joseph resists for a second. And then he hugs her back.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - LATER

           Wahlits comes out of his tipi, walking at a brisk pace...

                                 EAGLE ROCK (O.S.)
                        Where do you think you’re going?

           Wahlits stops dead in his tracks, then slowly turns around.

                                 WAHLITS
                        Nowhere...

                                 EAGLE ROCK
                        Who is she?

                                 WAHLITS
                        There is no one.

                                 EAGLE ROCK
                        Why do you lie to your father?
           Wahlits looks down, ashamed. BEAT.

                                 WAHLITS
                        Because she is promised to another.

           Eagle Rock nods, understanding.

                                 EAGLE ROCK
                        And yet you love her still.
                             (a moment, then)
                        Back before dark. There is still 
                        work to be done.

           Wahlits smiles and quickly leaves. Eagle Rock watches him 
           disappear into the woods, then gets back to work...

           INT. LAPWAI SCHOOL - LATER

           Rebecca, kind-hearted and sympathetic, sits across from 
           Joseph at a table near the back of the room.

                                 REBECCA
                             (In Nez Perce)
                        Your English has gotten worse.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I am out of practice.

           Rebecca smiles. A long silence ensues. Then:

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        White men have come before. But 
                        never this many. And there are 
                        soldiers, too. All over the land 
                        that was granted to us by the great 
                        chief in Washington. 
                             (Beat)
                        Why are they here?

           Rebecca hesitates, then slowly stands and goes to her desk... 

           She takes something out of the top drawer, then comes back 
           and sets it on the table with a soft thud. 

           Joseph looks down. A small gold nugget. He picks it up...

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Is this the same rock they found in 
                        the Black Hills?
                             (Rebecca slowly nods)
                        Is it true about Yellow Hair?

                                 REBECCA
                        Yes.
                                 JOSEPH
                        Do white men know the difference 
                        between the Lakota and Nez Perce?

                                 REBECCA
                        Some do. But many don’t.
                        Joseph, please...
                             (Beat)
                        Be careful.

           EXT. WALLOWA VALLEY - FOREST - LATER

           Eagle Rock, busy gathering firewood, stops when he hears a 
           strange RUSTLING nearby. 

           He makes his way through the thick trees towards a clearing 
           up ahead, where he discovers a RIDERLESS HORSE grazing 
           peacefully in the beautiful meadow. 

           Confused and intrigued, Eagle Rock steps into the open and 
           approaches the horse. He gently strokes the animal’s mane, 
           wondering what it could possibly be doing here all by itself.

           The horse continues to graze, not bothered by Eagle Rock’s 
           presence. Eagle Rock smiles, marveling at its beauty... 

           And then he notices the brand seared into the horse’s hide.

                                 LARRY OTT (O.S.)
                        Just hold it right there.

           Eagle Rock turns to find LARRY OTT, mean and terrible, 
           approaching with TWO BUDDIES. Their guns raised.

                                 LARRY OTT (CONT’D)
                        Think you can just steal my horse?

           Eagle Rock doesn’t understand English. But the guns and the 
           tone let him know he’s not welcome.

                                 EAGLE ROCK
                        Your horse is hungry. Your 
                        settlements do not have good 
                        grazing. That is why he came here.
                             (Motions to his mouth)
                        To eat.

                                 LARRY OTT
                        Anybody understand what the hell 
                        this Indian is saying?

           The white men laugh and shake their heads. Larry Ott points 
           to the brand on the horse’s hide...
                                 LARRY OTT (CONT’D)
                        Listen, now, I realize y’all ain’t 
                        much for personal property, but 
                        this here brand means the animal’s 
                        mine. You understand? 

           Eagle Rock slowly nods. Hoping to avoid trouble, he takes a 
           few cautious steps back, then turns and walks away...

           Larry Ott and his friends watch in total disbelief.

                                 LARRY OTT (CONT’D)
                        Now where in God’s name does he 
                        think he’s going?
                             (Shouting to Eagle Rock)
                        Hey! I don’t know what they do to 
                        horse thieves where you’re from but 
                        you don’t get to just walk away...!

           Larry Ott fires a shot past Eagle Rock’s head! Eagle Rock 
           drops to his knees and looks back, terrified. 

           Larry Ott, gun raised, motions “come here.” Eagle Rock stands 
           and slowly approaches...

                                 FRIEND #1
                        Larry? What ya gonna do?

                                 LARRY OTT
                        Teach ‘em a lesson...

           Eagle Rock reaches striking distance. Larry Ott slams the 
           butt of his rifle into Eagle Rock’s face...

           Eagle Rock falls to the ground. Larry Ott kicks him, cracking 
           his ribs. The white men howl with laughter...

           But then Eagle Rock grabs Larry Ott’s foot and twists his 
           ankle. Larry Ott drops to the ground...

                                 FRIEND #1
                        Whoa...!

           Eagle Rock attacks Larry Ott, hitting him again and again... 

                                 FRIEND #2
                        Larry?

                                 LARRY OTT
                        Goddamnit, would you get this son 
                        of a bitch off me?!

           The two friends raise their guns, nervous to fire...Eagle 
           Rock raises his arm, exposing his chest...
           Friend #1 fires! The bullet rips into Eagle Rock’s torso. He 
           hits the ground, still alive, and tries to crawl away...

           Larry Ott gets to his feet and grabs his friend’s gun...

                                 LARRY OTT (CONT’D)
                        Give me that...

           He walks over to Eagle Rock and takes aim as the wounded 
           warrior desperately tries to crawl away...

           His friends look away...the crack of a rifle explodes like 
           thunder and then fades away like the vanishing tide.

           The horse takes off into the woods as the two friends work up  
           the courage to look up and face what has been done.

           Eagle Rock’s lifeless body lies beneath Larry Ott’s smoking 
           rifle. A pool of blood around his head.

                                 FRIEND #1
                        Jesus. Now what?

           Larry Ott lets the smoke clear, then turns to his friends.

                                 LARRY OTT
                        Let’s go find my horse.

           One by one, the three men turn and walk away... 

           As they disappear into the forest, we slowly pan down to find 
           Eagle Rock’s fingers twitching...He’s still alive.

           EXT. WALLOWA VALLEY - EVENING

           Joseph arrives on horseback and discovers the tribe in panic. 
           Ollokot breaks away from the elders and quickly approaches...

                                 JOSEPH
                        What’s happened?

           INT. EAGLE ROCK’S TIPI - MOMENTS LATER

           Eagle Rock is on his death bed, surrounded by friends. His face 
           a mesh of blood and pulp. How he’s alive is anyone’s guess...

           Joseph enters with Ollokot and looks down in horror. BEAT.

                                 EAGLE ROCK
                        Who’s there? Joseph?

           Joseph sits down beside Eagle Rock and leans close. It takes 
           Eagle Rock a long time to say the following:
                                 EAGLE ROCK (CONT’D)
                        Tell my son...no vengeance. He will 
                        only make his people suffer...if he 
                        seeks revenge.

           Joseph slowly nods as Eagle Rock’s breathing grows weaker.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Wahlits and Little Bird come into the village  having spent the 
           day together. They’re happy and laughing...until Wahlits sees 
           the large gathering outside his father’s tipi. 

           Realizing something must be wrong, he quickly approaches...

           INT. EAGLE ROCK’S TIPI - CONTINUOUS

           Eagle Rock is dead. 

           Everyone in the room is quiet. Nobody knows what to say. 

           Joseph unfastens the BEADED NECKLACE around Eagle Rock’s 
           neck. He looks at it for a long, sad moment.

           There is a sudden commotion outside. Everyone looks up.

           EXT. EAGLE ROCK’S TIPI - CONTINUOUS

           Joseph comes outside and sees Wahlits being restrained by 
           Yellow Wolf and Black Owl. Other tribe members stand nearby.

           Joseph walks over and gives Wahlits his father’s necklace. 

           Wahlits looks at it for a heartbreaking moment, then charges 
           into his father’s tipi. His screams pierce the night...

           Joseph looks at Yellow Wolf and Black Owl, then turns and 
           sees Toohoolhoolzote watching from a distance...

           Ollokot steps through the crowd and approaches Joseph. BEAT.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Brother...what should we do?

           Joseph looks at Ollokot and says the simple truth:

                                 JOSEPH
                        I don’t know.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING

           A thundering LOCOMOTIVE discharges an ocean of steam. 

           General Howard steps onto the platform. 
           CAPTAIN DAVID PERRY (27) is waiting. He steps forward.

                                 PERRY
                        General Howard? David Perry. If 
                        you’ll follow me, sir, I have 
                        horses standing by...

           Howard nods and follows Perry down the platform...

           EXT. WALLOWA VALLEY - SUNSET

           Howard and Perry ride towards the Wallowa mountains...

                                 PERRY
                        Most of them have never seen a 
                        train up close. They see distant 
                        plumes of smoke and think it’s some 
                        great iron monster.

           Perry laughs, then realizes Howard is only half-listening. 

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        We...ah...have four divisions of 
                        calvary stationed nearby...just 
                        south of here...I thought it best 
                        to keep the troop presence in the 
                        valley to a minimum in the hopes of 
                        maintaining peace and order.

                                 HOWARD
                        That’s good thinking.

                                 PERRY
                        Thank you, sir.
                             (Beat)
                        Is it true what they say about you?

                                 HOWARD
                        What do they say about me?

                                 PERRY
                        That you marched with General 
                        Sherman through Georgia. 
                             (Beat)
                        All the way to the sea.

           Howard doesn’t answer. Perry takes that as a ‘yes’.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        That must’ve been something...

           Howard watches as the sun drops behind the mountains.
                                 HOWARD
                        Beautiful country.

                                 PERRY
                        What’s that, sir?

                                 HOWARD
                        I said it’s beautiful country. 
                             (Beat)
                        It’d be hard to leave.

           INT. LAPWAI - EVENING

           Howard and Perry ride down the street and stop at the HOTEL.

                                 PERRY
                        Your room’s ready. Rest of your 
                        things should be here by morning. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Thank you, Captain.

                                 PERRY
                        Will you be needing anything else?

           Howard nods over Perry’s shoulder...

                                 HOWARD
                        What’s going on at the courthouse?

           Confused, Perry turns. The courthouse lights are on. Dozens 
           of horses wait outside for their owners.

                                 PERRY
                        Oh...trial’s under way.

                                 HOWARD
                        What’s the charge?

                                 PERRY
                        Murder.

           Howard looks at Perry, concerned.

           INT. COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The courtroom is packed and segregated. The Nez Perce cram in 
           the back. Whites and Christian Indians sit in the pews. 

           Larry Ott and his buddies sit at the defendants’ table. 

           Howard and Perry step inside and discreetly observe. 
                                 PERRY
                             (To a nearby MINER)
                        What’s happening?

                                 MINER
                        Jury’s reached a verdict...

           Perry nods. He turns back to Howard. 

                                 HOWARD
                        When did this happen?

                                 PERRY
                        Few days ago. Trial went fast. 
                        Prosecution didn’t call any 
                        witnesses.

                                 HOWARD
                        Why not?

                                 PERRY
                        Nez Perce Indians refuse to swear 
                        an oath on the Bible.

                                 BAILIFF (O.S.)
                        All rise!

           Everyone seated stands as the ALL WHITE JURY returns...

           Howard looks over at the Nez Perce. Joseph is among them. 

           Joseph suddenly turns and looks right at Howard...

                                 HOWARD
                        Who’s that?

           Perry turns, looks. BEAT.

                                 PERRY
                        That’s Chief Joseph.

           Howard and Joseph size each other up from across the room...

                                 JUDGE
                        Has the jury reached a verdict?

                                 JURY FOREMAN
                        We have, Your Honor.

                                 JUDGE
                        In the matter presently before this 
                        court, how does the jury find?
                                 JURY FOREMAN
                        We find the defendants not guilty 
                        on all counts, Your Honor.

           The whites applaud as Larry Ott and his buddies receive 
           congratulatory pats on the back...

           Joseph turns and leaves the courtroom peacefully. The rest of 
           the Nez Perce follow his example -- even Wahlits. 

           Howard watches them leave, slowly, one at a time. 

           INT. HOWARD’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Howard unpacks. He hangs a fresh uniform in the closet and 
           sets some files down on the desk. He places a copy of The 
           Holy Bible on his bedside table. It looks worn and well read.

           Something catches Howard’s eye. Outside, distant fires light 
           up the night. Howard opens the window...

           The summer breeze carries sounds of far away chanting... 

           EXT. WALLOWA VALLEY - SAME TIME

           Eagle Rock’s funeral. Warriors dance around fires as tribe 
           members join in a mournful wail, savage and stirring. 

           Toohoolhoolzote, Ollokot, Black Owl, Oyema, Fairland, 
           Springtime, Noise of Running Feet, Swan Lace, Yellow Wolf, 
           Joseph...almost everyone participates. 

           Red Grizzly lurks in the shadows, watching.

           EXT. WALLOWA VALLEY - CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

           Wahlits sits by himself, staring down at a plot of disturbed 
           earth that marks his father’s grave. 

           Little Bird approaches and puts her arms around him. Wahlits 
           collapses into her embrace. 

           The mighty wails of the Nez Perce tribe float high into the 
           night sky and threaten to shake heaven itself.

           INT. HOWARD’S HOTEL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

           The room is still and silent for a brief moment. Then there 
           is a gentle knock...and the door slowly opens.

           Captain Perry pokes his head inside and finds General Howard 
           fully dressed, at his desk, reading his Bible. 

           Perry clears his throat. Howard finally looks up.
                                 PERRY
                        Ready when you are, sir.

           Howard closes his Bible, collects his things, and stands.

                                 HOWARD
                        Let’s go.

           EXT. WALLOWA VALLEY - SAME TIME

           Joseph stands beside Ollokot and Toohoolhoolzote in the grey 
           light of early morning. They look tired, but focused. 

           Distant horse hooves are heard. The three men stare O.S.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Here he is.

           LOOKING GLASS (45) comes riding up and dismounts. 

           Fierce, intelligent, attractive, Looking Glass is chief of a 
           Nez Perce settlement along the nearby Clearwater River. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Good to see you, Looking Glass. I 
                        only wish it were under happier 
                        circumstances.

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        News of Eagle Rock’s death filled 
                        my heart with great sadness. How is 
                        his son? How is Wahlits?

                                 JOSEPH
                        His burden is heavy. But he has 
                        promised to honor his father’s 
                        wishes and has sworn no acts of 
                        vengeance will follow.

           Looking Glass nods. BEAT.

                                 TOOHOOLHOOLZOTE
                        Are there white men along the 
                        Clearwater?

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        No. Not yet. Is is true there is a 
                        new White Chief from Washington?
                             (they nod)
                        What does he want?

                                 JOSEPH
                             (dramatic beat)
                        Let’s find out.
           EXT. LAPWAI GARRISON - MORNING

           A column of SOLDIERS stand at attention, waiting. 

           Howard looks over at Perry. Are they coming or not?

           And then there is a distant rumble...

           Joseph, Ollokot, Toohoolhoolzote, and Looking Glass come 
           riding into the garrison with HUNDREDS of WARRIORS...each on 
           an APPALOOSA HORSE, faces PAINTED RED, in FULL BATTLE DRESS. 

                                 PERRY
                        Jesus...

           The warriors circle the perimeter... 

           Joseph dismounts, then raises his hand. 

           For a moment, the garrison stands at the brink of war...

           Joseph puts his hand back down. 

           And with that signal, every warrior disarms. 

           Rifles, bows, knives, arrows are thrown to the ground. Even 
           Red Grizzly reluctantly disarms. It’s a remarkable gesture. 

           Howard and Perry sigh with relief. BEAT.

           EXT. LAPWAI GARRISON - LATER

           Howard sits at a table. Perry stands nearby at attention. The 
           Nez Perce sit on the ground, Joseph front and center.

           A WHITE TRANSLATOR stands between the two groups. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH
                        General Howard, I suspect I know 
                        the reason you are here. We will 
                        not sell the land. The land is our 
                        mother. You do not sell your 
                        mother. We will not sell the land. 

           Howard waits for the translation. BEAT.

                                 HOWARD
                        Well, Joseph...my understanding is 
                        that the land was already sold to 
                        us. By a Nez Perce Chief in 1863...

           Joseph responds before the translator has finished...
                                 JOSEPH
                        Chief Lawyer did not sell you the 
                        land because it was not his to 
                        sell. He does not speak for us and 
                        he does not speak for the land. 
                        Suppose I come to you and say I 
                        want to buy your horses. And you 
                        say no. So I go to your neighbor 
                        and say, “Sell me Howard’s horses.” 
                        And he does. If the Nez Perce sold 
                        the land, this is the manner in 
                        which it was done.

           Again, Howard waits for the translation.

                                 HOWARD
                        I suppose that’s a matter of 
                        opinion, now isn’t it?

           Joseph stares at Howard. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Our people have inhabited this land 
                        since the beginning of time. The 
                        white man arrived less than seventy 
                        winters ago. I know because my own 
                        father kept Father Lewis and Father 
                        Clark from starving. He gave them 
                        food and canoes and helped them 
                        find the great ocean to the west.

           Joseph stands and approaches Howard’s table... 

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        All we want is to live in the land 
                        of our ancestors. When so many of 
                        you came looking for gold, we let 
                        you search. When you have murdered 
                        our people, we have not sought 
                        revenge. We have not made war on 
                        you like the Lakota or the Crow. 
                        And when some of our people chose 
                        to adopt white man’s ways and 
                        follow the white man’s Book of 
                        Heaven, we let them go and live 
                        their lives as they saw fit 
                        according to their own hearts. My 
                        own father converted to the white 
                        man’s religion and named me Joseph. 
                        Through it all, we have always 
                        lived in peace.

           Howard stares at Joseph, listening to the translation. BEAT.
                                 HOWARD
                        I know you have, Joseph.
                             (Gathers his thoughts)
                        What I have come here to say will 
                        be difficult for many of you to 
                        hear. But if you’ll just give me 
                        some time to explain... 

           Joseph holds up his hand, silencing the translator. He’s had 
           enough of this. He looks right at Howard. 

                                 JOSEPH
                             (In English)
                        Time to explain? Why do you need 
                        time to explain? 

                                 HOWARD
                        Because it’s complicated.

           Joseph sets the gold nugget Rebbeca gave him on the table. 

                                 JOSEPH
                             (In English)
                        Lies are complicated. It does not 
                        take many words to speak the truth.

           Howard’s eyes narrow. He stands. The translator gets ready...

                                 HOWARD
                        Very well. The truth is that the 
                        Nez Perce have not had any legal 
                        claim to this land since they sold 
                        it in 1863. I stand here at the 
                        request of the President and on his 
                        authority. My orders are simple and 
                        will be executed. You are hereby 
                        ordered to leave this valley and go 
                        onto the reservation at Lapwai. I’m 
                        not here to buy your land, Joseph. 
                        I’m here to throw you off of ours.

           Joseph stares at Howard, enraged. The translator finishes.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (In English)
                        And if we refuse to go onto the 
                        reservation?

                                 HOWARD
                        Then I will send soldiers to put 
                        you there.

           Toohoolhoolzote can take no more. He stands, approaches.
                                 TOOHOOLHOOLZOTE
                        What is this? Who are you?! Who are 
                        any of you?! What man dares to tell 
                        another where he can go and how he 
                        can live?!

           Howard looks at Toohoolhoolzote. Without flinching, he says:

                                 HOWARD
                        I...am that man.

           In a burst of anger, Toohoolhoolzote swings at Howard... 

           Howard ducks, grabs his arm, twists it behind his back, and 
           slams Toohoolhoolzote down on the table. Hard.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Men, stand guard!

           The nearby soldiers take aim on the unarmed warriors. BEAT.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                             (To Toohoolhoolzote)
                        Do not underestimate me. I may be 
                        missing an arm, but I will put you 
                        down. You are outmatched. You are 
                        outnumbered. Do not forget this.
                             (To nearby GUARDS)
                        Lock him in the jail.

           The guards take Toohoolhoolzote away. Howard turns to face a 
           visibly shaken Joseph. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (In English)
                        We do not desire war.

           Howard looks at Joseph long and hard, then walks away. 

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - NIGHT

           A roaring fire dances orange on the bodies of Nez Perce 
           warriors and elders. Joseph and Ollokot stand before the 
           tribe. Looking Glass is present, as well.

                                 NEZ PERCE WARRIOR
                        Howard has shown us the rifle!

           Many voice their agreement... 

                                 BLACK OWL
                        Joseph...what should we do?
                                 JOSEPH
                        We must try to keep the peace.

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        What peace? Eagle Rock is dead. 
                        Toohoolhoolzoote is in jail. And 
                        the whites are all over the land. 
                        We are already at war!

           More shouts of agreement. Joseph waits for everyone to quiet.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Are you really so eager to go on 
                        the warpath, Red Grizzly?

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        The whites can be beaten. Sitting 
                        Bull beat them. We can beat them. 
                        War is the answer!

                                 JOSEPH
                        War is never the answer! 
                             (a moment, then)
                        It is always a failure of mankind.

           Silence. The fire crackles. And then:

                                 SWAN LACE
                        I’ve heard terrible stories about 
                        the Cheyenne being loaded onto the 
                        white man’s iron monster. They say 
                        it eats coal and breathes smoke and 
                        takes you to The Hot Place where 
                        you die... 
                             (Beat)
                        I wonder if they’ll send us there.

           Everyone sits, quietly gripped by fear. 

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Wahlits lurks in the shadows. DRUNKEN LAUGHTER is heard O.S.

           There is a cabin in the clearing up ahead. Larry Ott sits on 
           the porch with his buddies, drinking whiskey, toasting their 
           freedom, and howling at the full moon...

           Wahlits raises his rifle, taking aim...his finger tightens 
           around the trigger. All he has to do is squeeze. 

           His breathing grows heavy. His arms begin to shake. 

           He lowers the gun and drops to his knees. He can’t do it.
           EXT. LAPWAI RESERVATION - MORNING

           Joseph and Ollokot ride onto the reservation with Howard. 
           Barren and empty. They take a cautious look around...

                                 HOWARD
                        What do you think? Not a bad plot 
                        of land. Best part is no white men 
                        anywhere in sight. You can come and 
                        go and live your life any way you 
                        please. Just like you said.

           Joseph and Ollokot ride between a pair of EMPTY HOUSES.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Ever sleep indoors? More inviting 
                        than the ground, believe me. 
                        Especially when it rains.

           Joseph slowly turns his horse around to face Howard. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        If we accept your proposal, how 
                        long will we have to move?

                                 HOWARD
                        I can give you thirty days.

           Joseph glances back at the empty reservation. BEAT.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        ‘Mind if I ask your real name? Your 
                        Indian name, that is. The name you 
                        were given before your father 
                        baptized you Joseph.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You would find it difficult to 
                        pronounce.

                                 HOWARD
                        Try me.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Hinmuutu-Yalatlat.

           Howard gasps -- that’s quite a name.

                                 HOWARD
                        You’re right. I would find that 
                        difficult to pronounce.

           Joseph smiles, faintly. BEAT.
                                 JOSEPH
                        Do you know why I let you put 
                        Toohoolhoolzote in jail yesterday?

                                 HOWARD
                        I wasn’t aware that you let me do 
                        anything.

                                 JOSEPH
                        If you had been harmed, we would 
                        have been blamed. That’s why I let 
                        you take Toohoolhoolzote away and 
                        that’s why my father turned away 
                        from your church and your customs. 
                        Because the white man says one 
                        thing and does another. He offers 
                        treaties and then breaks them. His 
                        word is like the wind.

                                 HOWARD
                        Is that so? Well, let me tell you 
                        something...that man who stood 
                        trial the other day...Larry Ott. 
                        He’s a murderer. And I’m sure you 
                        blame us for his freedom, but he’d 
                        have been convicted if just one of 
                        you had testified... 
                             (Beat)
                        Is laying your hand on our holy 
                        book really that offensive to you? 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes.

                                 HOWARD
                        In God’s name, why?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Because, General Howard, we can 
                        tell the truth without raising our 
                        hands.

           Joseph kicks his horse and rides past Howard, away from the 
           reservation, back towards Wallowa. Ollokot follows...

                                 HOWARD
                        Joseph!

           Joseph and Ollokot stop and look back. BEAT.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Thirty days...or I send the entire 
                        American army against you.
           Joseph and Ollokot turn and gallop away.

           EXT. WALLOWA VALLEY - LATER

           Joseph and Ollokot come to a clearing at the fork of the 
           LOSTINE and WALLOWA RIVERS. The area seems sacred. 

           They dismount and kneel before a GRAVE. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I often wonder what he would do if 
                        he were alive today.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Do you feel his presence?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I feel his shadow.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Before he died, he begged us never 
                        to sell the land, Joseph.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I know. I was there.
                             (Beat)
                        I do not wish to sell our country. 
                        I do not wish to sell the bones of 
                        our father and mother. But I do not 
                        want war. I do not want bloodshed. 
                        I do not want my people killed.
                             (Beat)
                        I do not want anybody killed.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        You would give up our father’s 
                        grave?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I would give up everything rather 
                        than have the blood of whites upon 
                        the hands of our people.

           Not wishing to argue, Ollokot stands and leaves. 

           Joseph stares at the grave in silence.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t watch us, now.

           EXT. LAPWAI JAIL - EVENING

           A SOLDIER stands guard. Howard approaches on horseback.
                                 HOWARD
                        Corporal...

                                 SOLDIER
                        Sir?

                                 HOWARD
                        Release the prisoner.

           The soldier turns and disappears inside the jail...moments 
           later, Toohoolhoolzote comes outside, rubbing his wrists... 

           He looks down the street and sees Howard talking to Joseph. 
           The two men shake hands. Toohoolhoolzote can’t believe it... 

           EXT. WALLOWA VALLEY - NIGHT

           Joseph and Ollokot stand before an agitated tribe, listening 
           to a cacophony of protest...“What have you done?” “We can’t 
           leave!” “Your father never would’ve let this happen!” Etc.

           Black Owl, Oyema, Swan Lace, Fairland, and Yellow Wolf all stay 
           silent, their faces sad. Even Springtime remains quiet.

           Joseph looks devastated. Nearby, Looking Glass watches...

           EXT. LAPWAI - LATER

           Howard and Perry walk towards the hotel.

                                 HOWARD
                        I leave tomorrow for Washington. I 
                        trust you’ll make sure the Indians 
                        have relocated to the reservation 
                        in no less than thirty days time. 

                                 PERRY
                        Yes, sir. And congratulations.

           They stop at the hotel entrance. Howard looks at Perry.

                                 HOWARD
                        Congratulations? For what?

                                 PERRY
                        For resolving the situation 
                        peacefully. For bringing balance 
                        and justice to the valley.

                                 HOWARD
                        Yes, well...good night, Captain. 
                        Wallowa is now under your command.

           Howard goes inside the hotel. Perry takes a deep breath.
           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - LATER

           Joseph and Looking Glass walk along the edge of the village. 

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        I knew your father well. He did not 
                        live in such complicated times. All 
                        I know for sure...is he would do 
                        what was best for his people.

                                 JOSEPH
                        And what will you do?

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        Continue to live in peace. And pray 
                        that gold is never found along the 
                        Clearwater.

           Joseph smiles. The two men clasp hands.

                                 LOOKING GLASS (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye for now, my friend.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Safe journey.

           Looking Glass climbs onto his horse and gallops away... 

           INT. WAHLITS’ TIPI - SAME TIME

           Wahlits sits with Little Bird.

                                 WAHLITS
                        I had him in my sights...and I 
                        couldn’t do it. I’m such a coward.

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        No. You are brave. What’s more 
                        important? Your anger...or the 
                        final wishes of your father?

           Little Bird pulls him close and tries to comfort him...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Little Bird’s mother storms through the village and 
           disappears inside Wahlits’ tipi, emerging seconds later 
           dragging Little Bird by the arm... 

           Wahlits follows close behind...

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        Mother! No! Listen to me...!
                                 MOTHER
                        Horrible girl! You should be 
                        ashamed of yourself! You have no 
                        business being in there with him.
                             (To Wahlits)
                        And you! Stay away from her!

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        Mother...! No! Mother...!
                             (Dramatic Beat)
                        We are married!

           Mom stops. Heads turn. Little Bird breaks free and goes to 
           Wahlits. He puts his arm around her. It’s true. Married.

           Little Bird’s mother slowly approaches...

                                 MOTHER
                        Married?

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        Wahlits is my husband...

                                 MOTHER
                        You are to be the wife of another!

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        But...I love Wahlits.

           She slaps her daughter. Hard. Little Bird sobs...

                                 MOTHER
                        Married...what kind of coward 
                        marries in secret...?
                             (To Wahlits, with hatred)
                        Oh...I suspect I know...the same 
                        coward who lets the man who killed 
                        his father walk free without 
                        lifting so much as a finger.

           She spits at Wahlits’ feet and storms off, leaving the lovers 
           alone. But the damage has been done... 

           Little Bird is devastated. And Wahlits looks shell-shocked.

           He sees Yellow Wolf and Swan Lace staring at him. Ashamed and 
           overwhelmed, Wahlits turns and runs away...

           Nearby, Red Grizzly watches, sensing an opportunity...

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Red Grizzly and his gang of warriors find Wahlits sulking in 
           the shadows. They surround him. Wahlits looks up. BEAT. 
                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        The old hag has a point, you know? 
                        Why have you done nothing? Did you 
                        not love your father?

                                 WAHLITS
                        Of course I did! 

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Your father deserves vengeance. 

                                 WAHLITS
                        I promised...

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        You promised? The white man also 
                        promised...promised justice. He 
                        broke his promise. You are no 
                        longer bound by yours.

                                 WAHLITS
                        The thought of that man alive makes 
                        me sick.

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Really? Then why don’t you do 
                        something about it?

           Red Grizzly offers Wahlits a bottle of whiskey. Wahlits 
           hesitates, then starts drinking. Red Grizzly smiles. BEAT.

           INT. JOSEPH’S TIPI - LATER

           Joseph stares at Noise of Running Feet, fast asleep. 
           Springtime crosses the room and puts her arms around him. 

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        We could use some more meat.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’ll slaughter a calf tomorrow.
                             (Beat)
                        We should start thinking...about 
                        making preparations to leave.

           For a long time, Springtime does not respond. Then she slowly 
           lets go of her husband and goes to bed without saying a word.

           INT. HOWARD’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Howard packs to go home. His clothes. His files. His Bible. 

           He shuts off his light and goes to sleep.
           EXT. LARRY OTT’S CABIN - LATER

           Larry Ott’s cabin sits peacefully in the still night... 

           But then Wahlits, Red Grizzly, and a dozen YOUNG WARRIORS 
           emerge from the woods. Their faces red with war paint.

           They approach the cabin with quickening speed...

           INT. LARRY OTT’S CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           The warriors kick down the door and charge into the house, 
           guns raised. They find it empty... 

           Looks like Larry Ott has packed and left town...

           EXT. LARRY OTT’S CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           The warriors come outside, not sure what to do.

           And then Red Grizzly sees a light in the far distance. A 
           cabin. And the owners are obviously home.

           Red Grizzly nods, “Let’s Go.” The warriors follow...

           INT. NORTON RANCH - SAME TIME

           The NORTON FAMILY has just finished dinner. 

           MR. NORTON plays cards with three FRIENDS. MRS. NORTON does 
           the dishes. At the table, their SON (4) eats his dinner...

           The men see the warriors approaching the house...

                                 MR. NORTON
                        Kill the lights! Stay down!

           Mrs. Norton blows out the lanterns. The house goes dark.

           She grabs her boy and takes cover.  

           The men get their guns and rush outside...

           EXT. NORTON RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           ...They take cover and set their sights on the warriors.

           Red Grizzly holds up his hand. The warriors stop. BEAT.

                                 MR. NORTON
                        What do you want?!

           For a long time, nobody answers. Then:
                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        LARRY OTT!!

                                 MR. NORTON
                        He ain’t here! And I don’t know 
                        where he is, neither! Wouldn’t be 
                        surprised if he up and left...! He 
                        had a feeling you boys would come 
                        looking for him.

           The warriors have no idea what Mr. Norton is saying...

           INT. NORTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mrs. Norton peers out the window.

                                 SON
                        Mommy...? 

                                 MRS. NORTON
                        Shhhhhh! Stay down.

           She forces him out of sight, then glances at a shotgun 
           hanging on the far wall. Waiting for her use...

           EXT. NORTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Wahlits turns to Red Grizzly.

                                 WAHLITS
                        We should leave...

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Quiet!

                                 WAHLITS
                        These men have done nothing wrong!

           Red Grizzly gives Wahlits a look that says, “You better shut 
           up right now.” And Wahlits does just that. BEAT.

           The stand off continues. Neither side backing down...

           And then the following happens very quickly:

           One of the Norton Men tries to shift his position and knocks 
           over a stack of FIRE WOOD...the warriors go for their weapons 
           ...another Norton Man FIRES HIS GUN. He misses...

           All hell breaks loose...twenty rifles erupt at close range...

           INT. NORTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Bullets smash windows and pierce the walls...
           Mrs. Norton throws her body around her son as a shield...

           EXT. NORTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Norton men fire hastily. Nervous, they miss. 

           The warriors quickly overwhelm them. When the smoke clears, 
           four white men lay dead on the ground. 

           It grows very quiet. The warriors catch their breath, 
           realizing they are all alive and without injury.

           Red Grizzly takes in the victory. Smiling, he turns... 

           ...and sees Mrs. Norton on the porch with a shotgun...! 

           She pulls the trigger. Click. The gun misfires. 

           Red Grizzly hurls his tomahawk at her... 

           It slams into the door. She stumbles into the house... 

           INT. NORTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mrs. Norton grabs a KNIFE from the kitchen...

           Red Grizzly knocks it from her hand, then hits her again and 
           again until she stops resisting... 

           And then he starts to rape her...

           Wahlits enters, horrified by what he sees. He grabs Red 
           Grizzly and tries to pull him away... 

           The other warriors come in and drag Wahlits back outside. He 
           fights and struggles the entire way...

           Red Grizzly finishes his brutal assault and tosses Mrs. 
           Nortan to the ground like a rag doll. BEAT.

           She slowly gets up and turns around... 

           Red Grizzly stands at the doorway with his BOW AND ARROW 
           pointed her way...He fires! 

           The arrow slams into Mrs. Norton’s chest.

           She hits the floor with a sickening thud. 

           Satisfied, Red Grizzly turns and leaves.

           Hiding under the bed, Mrs. Norton’s young son stares at his 
           mother’s lifeless body as blood begins to pool on the floor.
           EXT. NORTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The warriors light TORCHES and set the house on fire. 

           Filled with blood-lust, they let out terrifying screams as 
           flames engulf the house, burning bright in the black night...

           Wahlits watches, deeply conflicted...

           The warriors turn and leave. One at a time. The last warrior 
           heaves a final torch at the house...

           INT. NORTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...the torch flies through the window and lands next to Mrs. 
           Norton...who is still alive. Her eyes flutter open. She 
           coughs blood and gasps for air... 

           Through the smoke and the heat, she somehow finds the 
           strength to break the arrow sticking out of her breast.

           And then she picks up her son and charges out the door as 
           flames spread all around them...

           EXT. NORTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mrs. Norton avoids looking at the bodies on the ground. 

           Carrying her son, she limps away from the fire and death, 
           towards the pitch black night and the cold, lonely woods...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - LATER

           Dawn is fast approaching. The village is asleep. 

           Red Grizzly and the warriors return, shouting, screaming, 
           firing their guns into the air...

                                 WARRIORS
                        It has begun! The war has begun!

           Their shouting continues as the village awakens. Hundreds of 
           people scatter. As the news spreads, panic grows.

           Many warriors seem excited. But the elderly, the women, and 
           the children all seem frightened by what is happening.

           Yellow Wolf finds Wahlits and grabs him by the arm.

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        What have you done?

                                 WAHLITS
                        Have you seen Little Bird? 
           Yellow Wolf shakes his head, “No”. Wahlits pulls free and 
           goes to look for her...

           EXT. WALLOWA RIVER - DAWN

           Ollokot holds down a calf so Joseph can slit it’s throat.

           Yellow Wolf suddenly appears, galloping towards them full 
           speed. He brings his horse to an abrupt stop. 

           Joseph and Ollokot wait for him to catch his breath...

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        There have been killings.

           EXT. MEADOW - DAWN

           A peaceful clearing at the edge of the forest. 

           Mrs. Norton stumbles out of the timber. Clothes drenched in 
           blood, arrow stub sticking from her breast, holding her boy 
           under her arm, she limps towards a nearby SETTLEMENT...

           MEN working in the field see her coming and run towards her. 

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - MORNING

           Joseph and Ollokot arrive to find the village in panic.

           Toohoolhoolzote is arming for war. Many others, including 
           Black Owl and Oyema, are preparing to leave...

           Joseph sees Springtime up ahead. He fights his way through 
           the crowd, finally reaching her...

                                 JOSEPH
                        Where’s Noise of Running Feet?

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        She’s home...Joseph, what are we 
                        going to do?!

                                 JOSEPH
                        Prepare to leave. Now. 

           EXT. NEZ PERCE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Ollokot charges through the village, looking for someone...

           Wahlits, searching for Little Bird, turns around just in time 
           for Ollokot to slap his face. Wahlits falls to the ground.

           Red Grizzly swings at Ollokot. Ollokot flips Red Grizzly over 
           his back and onto the ground. 
           Nearby WARRIORS restrain the other WAR PARTY INDIANS. 

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        You fools! You act like women and 
                        do nothing? The war has begun!

           Ollokot grabs Red Grizzly by the throat.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        You’re the fool. You’ve stuck a 
                        knife into all of our backs.

           Joseph rides over and stares down at the prisoners. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH
                        They’re going to hang you. All of 
                        you. And I’m going to let them.
                             (And then, to Wahlits)
                        So much for promises made to a 
                        dying father.

           The words hit Wahlits hard. He sees Little Bird staring at 
           him from a distance and hangs his head in shame...

           GUNSHOTS SUDDENLY RIP THROUGH THE VILLAGE...

           VIGILANTES are shooting from the trees. Warriors return fire, 
           driving them back as women and children take cover...

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                             (To Ollokot)
                        Strike all the tipis. We must be 
                        gone before the sun enters the sky.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - AFTERNOON

           Howard sits on a bench waiting for his train. 

           He notices a LITTLE GIRL on the opposite platform staring at 
           his missing arm. He smiles and waves. 

           The Little Girl hesitates, then waves back.

                                 STATION MANAGER (O.S.)
                        General Howard?
                             (Howard looks up)
                        Message for you, sir.

           Howard unfolds the piece of paper and reads. BEAT.

           A TRAIN WHISTLE shrieks O.S. But Howard doesn’t look up. 

           He stares at the piece of paper, unable to believe it. The 
           message reads, “WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN INDIAN WAR.”
           Howard stands and leaves. The Little Girl watches him go.

           EXT. WALLOWA VALLEY - LATER

           Joseph and Ollokot supervise as the Nez Perce tribe leaves 
           their homeland. Eight hundred people, mostly women, elderly, 
           and children - all running for their lives.

           Wahlits, Red Grizzly, and the War Party Indians have their 
           arms tied behind their backs and are escorted as prisoners.

           Black Owl and Oyema ride with their infant son.

           Yellow Wolf rides with Swan Lace.

           Most of the Indians are on foot. They run, fast and strong. 

           High on the distant bluffs and well out of range, white 
           vigilantes continue to fire at the fleeing tribe. 

           EXT. LAPWAI - SAME TIME

           People stand in the street, listening to far away gunshots. 

           Rebecca comes out of the school. She walks down the street, 
           staring towards the distant mountains. Afraid for Joseph... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Hidden in the dark woods under the cover of night, the Nez 
           Perce try to sleep. But most eyes are wide open. 

           Little Bird approaches Wahlits. 

           A WARRIOR standing guard blocks her path. But her eyes tell 
           him to stand aside, which he does. 

           Little Bird sits down beside Wahlits. BEAT.

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        Are you alright?

           Wahlits nods, trying to be brave.

                                 WAHLITS
                        And you?

           Little Bird doesn’t answer. She looks deep into his eyes.

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        Is it true...about the white woman?
           Wahlits stares at her through the darkness. Then:

                                 WAHLITS
                        I tried to stop it. Please believe 
                        me. I tried to stop it.

           Little Bird looks away. He has just broken her heart. 

           She removes the necklace he gave her and sets it down in the 
           dirt. And then she stands and walks away. 

           Wahlits watches her go. He has already lost everything.

           Nearby, Yellow Wolf and Swan Lace have watched the entire 
           exchange. They stare at Wahlits with horror and sympathy.

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Sounds of a nearby OWL vibrate through the peaceful woods.

           Oyema is awakened by the sound of a SNAPPING BRANCH. She 
           opens her eyes, but doesn’t move a muscle. And then:

           HUSHED WHISPERS and crunching FOOTSTEPS, coming closer... 
           LANTERNS and TORCHES suddenly visible through the trees. A 
           VIGILANTE ARMY, maybe fifty in number, approaches...

           Paralyzed by fear, the Nez Perce stay absolutely still. 

           Oyema glances down at her sleeping baby...

           The torches come closer and begin to pass the tribe...

           ANOTHER LOUD SNAPPING BRANCH! Oyema’s baby begins to cry... 
           just for a split second...and then, suddenly, it stops.

           Everyone looks out at the torches. Did they hear the baby? 
           They keep moving. The answer appears to be ‘no’. 

           Relieved, everyone looks back at Oyema...their eyes go wide.

           Oyema is covering her baby’s face with her hand, smothering 
           him in a desperate attempt to save the tribe... 

           The last few torches pass and disappear into the woods...

           Oyema, in an agony we can only imagine, waits for the sound 
           of their footsteps to grow faint...and then cease.

           Oyema lifts her hand. But it’s too late. Her baby is dead. 

           Black Owl comes over and kneels beside her. Oyema can not 
           bring herself to look at him.
           EXT. FOREST - DAWN

           The tribe gets up and starts moving... 

           Oyema is frozen in the same position. She can’t move. Can’t 
           breath. Black Owl sits nearby, somber and grief-stricken.

           The tribe moves past them. Sympathetic glances go unreturned.

           Finally, Black Owl tries to take the dead child from Oyema. 
           She tightens her grip, then finally lets go.

           Black Owl stands and walks into the forest to bury his son. 
           Oyema remains still as the tribe shuffles past her...

           EXT. NORTON RANCH - MORNING

           General Howard arrives on horseback to find the meadow 
           crowded with SOLDIERS, NEIGHBORS, and VOLUNTEERS.

           He sees Mrs. Norton wrapped in a blanket, surrounded by 
           friends. He dismounts and approaches.

                                 HOWARD
                        Mrs. Norton? 

           She doesn’t respond. Howard turns to a nearby DOCTOR.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Is she going to be alright?

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        What in the hell kind of question 
                        is that? Of course she ain’t gonna 
                        be alright. Look around you!

           Howard glances back at Mrs. Norton. She remains unresponsive. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Who’s the ranking officer on site?

           A nearby SOLDIER steps forward. Howard turns to face him.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Captain Perry?

                                 SOLDIER
                        Dispatched with two divisions early 
                        this morning. Thought he might be 
                        able to overtake them...

                                 HOWARD
                        Where’s my cavalry? Have they been 
                        ordered to assemble?
                                 SOLDIER
                        Yes, sir. Cavalry and infantry are 
                        standing by, awaiting orders.

                                 HOWARD
                        We move out immediately.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Yes, sir.

           The soldier salutes and leaves with a sense of urgency. 

           Nearby, we find that Rebecca has arrived to see for herself 
           if the rumors are true. She can’t believe it.

           Howard stares at the ground where great pools of dried blood 
           mark where each body fell. He slowly turns around...

           Mrs. Norton is staring at him from a distance.

           Howard hesitates, then walks away from the smoldering ash, 
           feeling Mrs. Norton’s stare the whole way. 

           Reaching his horse, Howard prepares to mount up...

                                 MRS. NORTON (O.S.)
                        General Howard?

           Howard slowly turns to face her. Everyone quiets. BEAT.

                                 MRS. NORTON (CONT’D)
                        Kill them all.

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - RIDGE - DAY

           Warriors line the ridge overlooking the majestic canyon. 
           Ollokot comes over and takes position beside Joseph.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Everything you asked for has been 
                        done. We’re ready.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Toohoolhoolzote?

           Ollokot nods towards the CANYON FLOOR... 

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - FIELD - SAME TIME

           Toohoolhoolzote and Black Owl lead a team of TWENTY WARRIORS. 
           They spread out across the canyon floor and crouch down -- 
           disappearing into the TALL GRASS. 

           Warriors on HORSES take position behind THICK TREES...
           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - RIDGE - SAME TIME

           Joseph and Ollokot continue to watch and wait.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        How much time do you think we have?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Not long.

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - REAR GUARD - SAME TIME

           We find the women and children stationed far away from what 
           will be the front lines of the battlefield.

           Oyema sits alone, wrapped in a veil of grief. 

           Fairland comes over and kneels beside her. Oyema collapses 
           into tears. Fairland comforts her sister as best she can.

           Nearby, Yellow Wolf loads his rifle. Swan Lace approaches.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        Promise me you’ll be careful.

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        I promise.

           He turns to go. She grabs his arm. BEAT.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        You’re all I have.

           Yellow Wolf kisses her on the cheek, then leaves to join the 
           warriors. Swan Lace watches him go, afraid. 

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - RIDGE - SAME TIME

           Red Grizzly, Wahlits, and other “war party” Indians are 
           escorted to the ridge and forced to sit down.

           Yellow Wolf follows close behind, taking position along the 
           ridge not far away from Joseph and Ollokot.

           The WIND blows, bringing with it the sound of an approaching 
           ARMY. Warriors raise their rifles, taking aim.

           HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS come into view on the far side of the 
           canyon. It’s an intimidating arrival. The Nez Perce tribe may 
           be eight hundred strong, but most are women and children. The 
           warriors are outnumbered more than two to one.

           A WARRIOR raises a large, WHITE FLAG into the air. It unfurls 
           and flaps in the breeze, easily visible for miles.
           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - PERRY’S POSITION - THAT MOMENT

           Captain Perry stares through BINOCULARS at the billowing 
           white flag. He’s flanked by several CORPORALS.

                                 CORPORAL
                        I’ll be damned. We caught ‘em.

                                 PERRY
                        Of course we did. They’re trapped 
                        between the canyon and the river 
                        with nowhere to go. Suing for peace 
                        is their only option... 

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - RIDGE - SAME TIME

           Joseph, Ollokot, and four other WARRIORS mount their horses. 

           The prisoners are led over the ridge. Wahlits glances at 
           Yellow Wolf before disappearing from view. 

           Joseph rides over to Yellow Wolf and the other warriors 
           lining the ridge. He speaks loud enough for all to hear:

                                 JOSEPH
                        If fighting begins, shoot the 
                        soldier with the horn first.

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        What? Why?

                                 NEZ PERCE WARRIOR   
                        Horns don’t fire bullets. Guns do.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Shoot the soldier with the horn, 
                        first. After that, you may fire at 
                        men with guns.

           Joseph turns and descends the canyon...

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - PERRY’S POSITION - SAME TIME

           Perry watches as Joseph leads six warriors and the train of 
           prisoners towards the center of the canyon floor.

           Perry spurs his horse forward. Along with six soldiers of his 
           own, he goes out to meet Joseph half way...

           Nearby, American soldiers stand ready, bracing for the worst. 

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           Joseph and his warriors reach the middle ground first. 
           The white flag continues to flap in the wind. 

           The war party prisoners stand silent.

           Perry and his men come riding into view. They stop just a few 
           yards from Joseph. BEAT.

                                 PERRY
                        I’m listening.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (In English)
                        These are the young men who did the 
                        killing. They acted on their own 
                        with no authority. I give them to 
                        you now so that you may judge them 
                        as you will.

                                 PERRY
                        And your people?

                                 JOSEPH
                        We will go to the reservation as 
                        General Howard said. 

           Perry glances at his men, not sure he heard right...

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - RIDGE - SAME TIME

           U.S. Troops take aim at Joseph and the six warriors below. 

           Among these soldiers is HENRY FITZGERALD. He puts his finger 
           on the trigger and stands ready...

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           Perry nudges his horse closer to Joseph...

                                 PERRY
                        Of course, we’ll require you to 
                        surrender your weapons. And you’re 
                        hereby ordered to proceed back to 
                        Lapwai immediately.

           There’s a SNAKE on the ground, slithering between horses...

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        We’ll make sure your women and 
                        children are well fed. I know 
                        they’ve had a long journey.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Thank you.
           Perry nods and the war party prisoners are taken into 
           American custody. The deal is just about closed...

           ...when suddenly the snake on the ground spooks one of the 
           Nez Perce horses. It rears up. The warrior’s arms flail...

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - RIDGE - THAT MOMENT

           Henry Fitzgerald sees the spooked horse and FIRES his gun...

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - FIELD - THAT MOMENT

           The CRACK of a rifle is heard and then the bullet explodes 
           into the shoulder of the warrior holding the WHITE FLAG...

           And the battle begins...

           The Battle of White Bird Canyon

           An AMERICAN BUGLER blows his horn...six bullets rip his body 
           apart before he’s completed the first bar. 

           The American army is thrown into disarray...

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Yellow Wolf and the other warriors watch the army scatter. 
           They open fire on the other soldiers...

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           The Nez Perce outflank the Americans on every side. Fire 
           rains down from the hills above.

           American soldiers are shocked to see RIDERLESS HORSES 
           charging their way...until they realize that Nez Perce 
           warriors are clinging to the SIDES of their horses, hidden 
           from view, and firing rifles underneath their horses’ necks! 

           Toohoolhoolzote and Black Owl pop out of hiding and lead 
           their warriors in a charge towards the Americans, killing 
           soldiers in brutal hand-to-hand combat.

           Sensing the battle is lost, Captain Perry retreats - as does 
           every other soldier on a horse. 

           After several grueling, bloody moments, the battle is over. 

           The bodies of so many dead American soldiers litter the 
           beautiful canyon. The rest retreat, running for their lives.

           And not one single Nez Perce warrior has been killed.
           Joseph and Ollokot take in the sobering sight. This is the 
           most dramatic defeat for the U.S. Army since Little Big Horn.

           Toohoolhoolzote and Black Owl, covered in blood, unleash 
           screams of victory, raising their rifles high in the air...

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Swan Lace, Oyema, and Fairland stare down at the screaming 
           warriors as cries of victory erupt around them.

           Yellow Wolf stands nearby with his smoking rifle and screams 
           with the other warriors lining the canyon ridge...

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Ollokot takes out his knife and stands before Red Grizzly. 
           For a moment, it seems that Ollokot is going to kill him. 

           But instead, he cuts Red Grizzly’s restraints. The other 
           prisoners are set free, as well... 

           Ollokot storms off, angry and frustrated. Red Grizzly basks 
           in his reprieve. Wahlits rubs his wrists.

           The victory screams get louder, echoing off the canyon walls. 

           EXT. PLATEAU - LATER

           The Nez Perce come to a STEEP DECLINE. 

           CAMERA CRANES up and over as they make their way down to the 
           SNAKE RIVER...more than a thousand feet below! 

           The sight takes our breath away.

           EXT. SNAKE RIVER - FERRY CROSSING - LATER

           The FERRY OWNER, a white man, comes out of his house, armed 
           with a RIFLE. His WIFE follows close behind.

                                 FERRY OWNER
                        Stay inside.

           She goes back in the house and shuts the door. 

           Joseph and Ollokot approach on horseback.

                                 FERRY OWNER (CONT’D)
                        What do you want?

                                 JOSEPH 
                             (In English)
                        Need to use ferry.
                                 FERRY OWNER
                        No chance in hell. Get off my land!

           Ferry Owner raises his gun, taking aim. Behind Joseph and 
           Ollokot, 800 Nez Perce come into view! 

           Overwhelmed by the sight, Ferry Owner lowers his gun. BEAT.

                                 FERRY OWNER (CONT’D)
                        You have any idea how high the 
                        river is? It’s flooding! You’ll 
                        never get across!

           Joseph gives him a look as if to say, “We’ll see.”

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. SNAKE RIVER - LATER

           The Nez Perce dive into the raging water and swim more than 130 
           feet to the other side. Heads strain to stay above water. 
           Horses kick and swim with all their might. 

           They use the ferry to transport children and elderly. 

           Ferry Owner watches it all with absolute disbelief.

           EXT. WHITE BIRD CANYON - LATER

           General Howard walks through the tall grass while AMERICAN 
           SOLDIERS bury the dead. In Howard’s eyes, there is an anger 
           we have not seen before. Focused and intense. 

           Captain Perry approaches from behind. BEAT.

                                 PERRY
                        Was Georgia anything like this?

                                 HOWARD
                        What was that?

           Howard turns around. Perry starts to stumble.

                                 PERRY
                        I just...I said...

                                 HOWARD
                        Speak up, Captain. I can’t hear 
                        you. And talk fast. Cause you got a 
                        lot of explaining to do.

                                 PERRY
                        Sir?
                                 HOWARD
                        Do you know what General Sherman 
                        said to me when he gave me my 
                        orders? “No more Little Big Horns.”
                        What do you call this?

                                 PERRY
                        It shouldn’t have happened.

                                 HOWARD
                        But it did happen. Under your 
                        command, Captain.

                                 PERRY
                             (Fumbling for excuses)
                        We had the high ground, superior 
                        numbers, veteran forces who had 
                        been tested in battle...

                                 HOWARD
                        They lured you into a trap.

                                 PERRY
                        I don’t see how. They’re just...

           Perry catches himself too late.

                                 HOWARD
                        Go on. They’re just what? Ignorant 
                        savages? Superstitious people? 
                        Never seen a train before, how 
                        could they beat a modern army?!

           Howard gets right in Perry’s face and points to the ridge.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Look! They fired on you from the 
                        south ridge, drawing you further 
                        into the canyon, then they swept 
                        around from the rear. Now I don’t 
                        know if you have a name for that, 
                        but at West Point, we used to call 
                        it a flanking maneuver. Worst thing 
                        you can ever do is underestimate 
                        your enemy. They set the trap, 
                        waited for you in the canyon, and 
                        then blew your command straight to 
                        hell. Didn’t they?

                                 PERRY
                             (hesitates, then)
                        Yes, sir.

           Disgusted, Howard turns and walks away.
           EXT. LOOKING GLASS’S VILLAGE - DAY

           The village sits along the beautiful CLEARWATER RIVER. 

           Looking Glass comes out of his tipi...there are a few 
           precious moments of peace...and then the SCREAMING begins...

           Looking Glass turns and sees an approaching ARMY... 

           Women and children run for their lives. Warriors brace for 
           attack. Gunshots rip through the village...

           EXT. SNAKE RIVER - MORNING

           Howard watches as the mighty current overturns a RAFT filled 
           with his men, sweeping them down river. 

           Frustrated, he turns to the Ferry Owner.

                                 HOWARD
                        How did the Indians get across?

                                 FERRY OWNER
                        They just dove in and swam to the 
                        other side. 

           Howard stares at the river, dumbfounded. Then he realizes:

                                 HOWARD
                        They know where the current breaks.
                             (To Ferry Owner)
                        Where’s the next place to cross?

                                 FERRY OWNER
                        Half a day’s ride south of here.

           Howard stares at the river and shakes his head.

           EXT. RIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON

           The Nez Perce tribe continues its long exodus. Curving over a 
           hill, stretching for miles, they walk towards the horizon.

           Joseph, Ollokot, and Toohoolhoolzote sit on their horses and 
           stare solemnly at something OFF SCREEN. 

           Distant shouting gets their attention. They turn and see 
           Looking Glass approaching from the south, leading the battle 
           weary survivors of his village. 

           Looking Glass waits for his people to absorb into the tribe, 
           then rides over to join Joseph, Ollokot, and Toohoolhoolzote. 
           The four men look at one another, then stare, once again, at 
           something far in the distance: the Wallowa Mountains.

           Already more than two hundred miles away, the four Nez Perce 
           leaders take a final, lingering look at their home, realizing 
           perhaps, that they will never see it again. 

           And then they turn and join their people eastward bound.

           INT. SHERMAN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Sherman leans against his desk, facing a team of ADVISORS.

                                 SHERMAN
                        What am I supposed to tell the 
                        President? How do I explain to the 
                        mothers of all those dead American 
                        soldiers, not to the mention the 
                        public to whom we promised there 
                        would be no more Little Big Horns? 
                        This is not acceptable!

           An ADVISOR motions to a LARGE MAP on the wall.

                                 ADVISOR
                        Sir, if I may draw your attention 
                        to the map for a moment, we have 
                        five divisions closing in on the 
                        Nez Perce as we speak...  

           A SOLDIER quietly enters and hands Sherman a message.

                                 ADVISOR (CONT’D)
                        ...Colonel Wallace is marching with 
                        his troops from Ft. Camus. Captain 
                        Whipple is coming from the South. 
                        General Stephenson, the East. 
                        Colonel Monroe, the South East. 
                        And, of course, General Howard will 
                        continue his pursuit from the West. 
                        It’s only a matter of time. The 
                        noose is tightening. They may not 
                        know it yet, but the Nez Perce have 
                        already been defeated.

           Sherman, busy reading, finally looks up. 

                                 SHERMAN
                        They’ve crossed the Snake.

                                 ADVISOR
                        I beg your pardon, sir?
                                 SHERMAN
                        The Snake River. The Nez Perce 
                        crossed it. Two days ago.

                                 ADVISOR
                        That’s impossible...

           Sherman hands him the message so he can read for himself, 
           then crosses the room to take a closer look at the map.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Which means, assuming I’m reading 
                        this map correctly, they just 
                        outmaneuvered our entire army.

                                 ADVISOR
                        This can’t be. Our calculations 
                        were precise.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Well, how did you factor foot 
                        speed? Running or walking?

                                 ADVISOR
                        Sir?

                                 SHERMAN
                        Their speed. Running or walking?

                                 ADVISOR
                        Well...walking, naturally.

                                 SHERMAN
                        There’s your problem. White men 
                        walk. Indians run.

           Everyone in the room stiffens. Nervous glances are exchanged. 
           The Advisor takes a moment to gather his thoughts.

                                 ADVISOR
                        Sir, I can’t help but wonder, in 
                        view of this recent development, 
                        whether we might consider... 
                        relieving General Howard of his 
                        command?

                                 SHERMAN
                        What? Why would I do that?

                                 ADVISOR
                        The defeat at White Bird...

                                 SHERMAN
                        That was Perry’s debacle.
                                 ADVISOR
                        Perry was under Howard’s command. 
                             (Beat)
                        I like Howard, sir. I think we all 
                        do. But, you know better than 
                        anyone, he was with you in Georgia. 
                        Do you really believe he has the 
                        stomach for this sort of thing? 
                        What I mean to say is...will he 
                        push through to the very end?

           Sherman’s eyes narrow. Staring at the map, he seems to see 
           something the others have missed.

                                 SHERMAN
                        General Howard stays. And you tell 
                        the commanders of the other four 
                        divisions when they converge, they 
                        are hereby ordered to turn over 
                        their command to General Howard.
                             (Off Advisor’s look)
                        Don’t look at me like that. I have 
                        my reasons.

           EXT. WEIPPE PRAIRIE, IDAHO - DAY

           The Nez Perce make their way across a beautiful ocean of 
           flowers - purple, white, yellow - in full bloom. Beyond the 
           prairie lies the LOLO TRAIL and the BITTERROOT MOUNTAINS.

           Joseph signals the tribe to stop. He turns to face them.

                                 JOSEPH
                        It was at this very spot that our 
                        fathers met the white chiefs Lewis 
                        and Clark and made the fateful 
                        choice to help them. It is fitting 
                        that we are here now...because 
                        another choice is before us. And I 
                        can not make it alone.
                             (Beat)
                        We can not go North. Flatheads hold 
                        that land and would not welcome us. 
                        To the South, there is nothing but 
                        desert and white men...

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        We could go East.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        And risk dealing with the Crow?

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        They hate the White Man...
                                 JOSEPH
                        No. They fear him. And they would 
                        betray us to win his favor...

                                 TOOHOOLHOOLZOTE
                        We should stand and fight! We have 
                        beaten the white soldiers once, 
                        already. We can do it again!

                                 JOSEPH
                        They are too many. They will keep 
                        coming. And then winter will arrive 
                        and we will starve. Look at us! We 
                        are mostly women and children. We 
                        can not fight a war...

                                 BLACK OWL
                        We could if we were greater in 
                        number. If we could unite the 
                        tribes. I tell you, the white man 
                        would fear us, then...

           Red Grizzly rides forward.

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        I’ll tell you something else about 
                        the White Man. Not only is he weak 
                        and lazy...he is tired of fighting. 
                        Just a few winters ago, there was a 
                        great war in the East. And more 
                        soldiers were killed than there are 
                        stars in the sky. Demonstrate force 
                        and the White Man will fold like a 
                        blade of grass.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        I am not interested in anything you 
                        say, Red Grizzly. If we were not 
                        desperate for warriors, I would 
                        shoot you myself for what you have 
                        brought upon our people.

           Joseph glances at his brother, concerned.

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        We should head East and join with 
                        the Crow.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        And if that fails?

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        Then we go North. To Canada.
           Everyone looks up. Someone has finally said it. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Sitting Bull is in Canada.

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        So are his five thousand warriors. 
                        He’ll help us.  

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Do you know how long it will take 
                        us to get there? A hundred moons. 
                        It will be winter by the time we 
                        arrive. We will freeze to death if 
                        the soldiers don’t kill us first...

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        We can make it. A new country. And 
                        with the strength of Sitting Bull’s 
                        numbers, we could come back and 
                        reclaim Wallowa...

           Joseph turns and looks out at his people, their faces seem 
           focused and alert, clearly captivated by this idea. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH
                        So be it.

           INT. HOWARD’S TENT - MORNING

           Howard sits at his desk writing some correspondence. Captain 
           Perry enters. Howard doesn’t look up.

                                 PERRY
                        Sir? Some Bannock Indians have come 
                        to meet with you.

           Howard stands and follows Perry out the door.

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Howard walks with Perry through the camp. Their numbers have 
           tripled in size. Clearly, the other divisions pursuing the 
           Nez Perce have converged with Howard’s command.

           A group of SIX BANNOCK SCOUTS stand waiting up ahead. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Good afternoon. Speak English?

           One of the Bannock Scouts nods. Howard addresses him.
                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        As I’m sure it’s been explained, we 
                        are in pursuit of a fugitive band 
                        of Nez Perce Indians. I need scouts 
                        who know the land and can serve as 
                        guides and interpreters.

                                 BANNOCK SCOUT
                        How much you pay?

                                 HOWARD
                        Ten dollars a day.

                                 BANNOCK SCOUT
                        To each?

                                 HOWARD
                        That’s right.

                                 BANNOCK SCOUT
                        We want whiskey, also. And guns.

                                 HOWARD
                        No. I don’t do that. And there will 
                        be no scalping, either. You hear 
                        me? If we engage in battle, you 
                        will not take hair from the bodies 
                        of the dead. That’s the deal. Ten 
                        dollars a day. Take it or leave it. 

           The Bannock Scout reluctantly nods ‘yes’.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                             (To Perry)
                        Get these men some food. 
                             (As he walks away)
                        We leave in one hour!

           EXT. SNAKE RIVER PLAINS - DAY

           General Howard’s giant army comes charging over the ridge. 
           Every man on a horse, in hot pursuit. 

           God help the Nez Perce if this army catches them.

           EXT. WEIPPE PRAIRIE - DUSK

           The Nez Perce continue their flight. 

           Joseph sees two SCOUTS approaching. He rides over to meet 
           them. Ollokot and Looking Glass follow close behind.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What news?
                                 SCOUT #1
                        Howard. We saw him.

                                 JOSEPH
                        How far?

                                 SCOUT #2
                        Day’s ride. Maybe less. His numbers 
                        have increased. Every man on a 
                        horse and gaining fast!

           Joseph turns to Ollokot and Looking Glass.

                                 JOSEPH
                        We ride through the night.

           Looking Glass and Ollokot nod in agreement, then kick their 
           horses and follow Joseph back towards the fleeing tribe.

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT

           The Americans sit around campfires, eating dinner. A distant 
           COYOTE howls at the moon...

           EXT. LOLO TRAIL - NIGHT

           The Nez Perce hear the same coyote as they enter the thick 
           timber of the LOLO TRAIL. Tired from walking all day, they 
           keep going -- deeper into the trees... 

           Oyema brings her hand to her chest. She’s sore. 

           Ollokot and Fairland ride together. Both look tired.

           Little Bird’s mother begins to drift asleep. Toohoolhoolzote 
           rides up and gives her a gentle nudge. She snaps awake. 

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        Thank you.

           Toohoolhoolzote nods “you’re welcome” and rides ahead.

           Nearby, Wahlits rides alone. He stares at Little Bird. In his 
           hands, he holds the necklace she returned to him.

           Swan Lace rides on the other side of the trail. 

           Yellow Wolf rides next to her. He stares through the trees at 
           Red Grizzly, riding awake and alert. Like a predator.

           Near the front, Springtime holds her sleeping daughter and 
           struggles to stay awake. Joseph rides up beside her.
                                 JOSEPH
                        Give her to me...

           Joseph lifts Noise of Running Feet into his arms. Springtime 
           rubs her tired eyes. 

           The tribe presses forward. Everyone struggles to stay awake.

           Near the back of the line, Black Owl sees something strange: 
           a RIDERLESS HORSE walking alone through the trees...

           EXT. WEIPPE PRAIRIE - MORNING

           Morning sun beats down on the face of a young NEZ PERCE BOY, 
           still asleep on the ground where he fell off his horse.

           Shadows fall across his face. The boy opens his eyes. Bannock 
           Scouts are standing over him. 

           They grab his hair and lift the boy to his feet...

           EXT. WEIPPE PRAIRIE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Howard arrives with the rest of his men. Captain Perry rides 
           over to greet him with a sense of urgency.

                                 HOWARD
                        What is it?

                                 PERRY
                        Scouts captured a prisoner.

           INT. TENT - MOMENTS LATER

           The young Nez Perce boy has been beaten terribly. His face is 
           swollen and bleeding. He sits quietly, in great pain.

           Howard and Perry enter. Howard sees the boy and looks to 
           Perry for an explanation.

                                 PERRY
                        I wasn’t here when they found him.

           Howard stares down at the young boy. BEAT.

           INT. TENT - LATER

           An ARMY DOCTOR attends to the boy’s wounds. 

           A Bannock Scout stands nearby. Howard stares at him. The 
           Indian’s eyes betray no remorse. 

           The doctor finishes and shuts his bag.
                                 HOWARD
                        Thank you.

           The doctor nods and leaves. BEAT. 

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                             (To Nez Perce boy)
                        Are you hungry? Would you like 
                        something to eat?
                             (To Bannock Scout)
                        Tell him what I just said.

           The Bannock Scout steps forward and translates. 

           The young boy shakes his head, “No.” 

           Howard unfolds a map and slides it across the table. 

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        I need to know where the Nez Perce 
                        are planning to make their final 
                        stand. Can you tell me?

           The Bannock Scout translates. The young boy looks at Howard, 
           confused, and says nothing. BEAT.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Why did Joseph decide to cross the 
                        Snake River?

           The Bannock Scout translates. Again, the boy says nothing.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Understand, you’re going to tell me 
                        what I need to know one way or the 
                        other. Which way did they go? 

           The Bannock Scout translates. And this time the boy speaks...

                                 BANNOCK SCOUT
                        He says it is too late. You won’t 
                        find them. They’re already gone.

                                 HOWARD
                        Yes, I understand that, but where 
                        have they gone?

                                 BANNOCK SCOUT
                        He says they’ve disappeared into 
                        the timber and you won’t find them.

                                 HOWARD
                        The timber? What timber? 
                             (Suddenly realizes)
                                 (MORE)
                                 HOWARD (CONT'D)
                        Are you trying to tell me they’ve 
                        started up the Lolo Trail?

           The young boy, sensing he’s made a mistake, says nothing.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Why would they do that? The Lolo 
                        Trail takes them into the 
                        Bitterroot Mountains, the 
                        Bitterroot Mountains take them into 
                        Montana. That’s Crow Country. If 
                        they go East, they’ll be trapped in 
                        Yellowstone Park, if they go West, 
                        they’ll run back into us. If they 
                        go North, it’ll be nothing but wide 
                        open plains as far as Canada--

           Howard suddenly stops. His eyes go wide. He gets it. He 
           stands up and quickly leaves the room.

           EXT. WEIPPE PRAIRIE - LATER

           Storm clouds gather in the darkening sky. Strong gusts of wind 
           blow through camp. Howard hands a message to a SOLDIER.

                                 HOWARD
                        Wire ahead to Charles Rawn in the 
                        Bitterroot Valley. Warn him eight 
                        hundred Indians will be coming down 
                        out of the mountains. They should 
                        lock their doors, board their 
                        windows, and stay inside.

           Howard hands the soldier another envelope. This one sealed.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        And send this to General Sherman in 
                        Washington.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Yes, sir.

           The soldier climbs on his horse and gallops away. Howard 
           watches him disappear into the dark night. BEAT.

                                 PERRY (O.S.)
                        They were going to surrender.

           Howard slowly turns and finds Perry standing nearby.

                                 HOWARD
                        What was that?
                                 PERRY
                        At White Bird. They were going to 
                        surrender and turn over the 
                        warriors who committed the raid on 
                        Norton’s Ranch.
                             (Beat)
                        We fired first.

           Another strong gust of wind whips through the camp as THUNDER 
           ERUPTS overhead. Howard looks to the sky...

           EXT. LOLO TRAIL - SAME TIME

           The Nez Perce hear the thunder, too, as they march through 
           the heavy timber. It starts to RAIN. A torrential downpour. 

           The tribe keeps moving as the ground begins to soften...

           A LARGE MUDSLIDE suddenly sweeps twenty Nez Perce down the 
           hillside, slamming them hard into trees, breaking bones...

           Red Grizzly rides past the injured Nez Perce. Caring only for 
           himself, he doesn’t stop. 

           Yellow Wolf and Wahlits dismount and help the wounded as the 
           blinding rain continues to pound the earth.

           Joseph watches a GIANT TREE shake loose in the mud and fall 
           to the ground with a deafening thud. He gets an idea...

                                 JOSEPH
                             (To Ollokot)
                        Let’s push them all down.

           Ollokot stares at Joseph through the rain, confused.

           EXT. LOLO TRAIL - MORNING

           The day is bright and beautiful after the epic rainstorm. 

           Howard follows the Bannock Scouts into the forest of the Lolo 
           Trail...they soon stop dead in their tracks. BEAT.

           What Joseph and the Nez Perce have left in their wake will 
           soon become known as “The Bloody Trail.” Fallen trees, 
           boulders, and jagged branches obscure the path for miles!

           Howard’s men try to make their way, but soon horses are 
           breaking legs, stumbling, and tripping...

           One horse falls and impales itself on a jagged tree branch. 
           It’s death screams are terrible...
           EXT. BITTERROOT MOUNTAINS - DAY

           The Nez Perce make a steep climb up the mountains. Another 
           harrowing drop that makes our palms sweat. Two PACK MULES 
           suddenly fall to their deaths. The tribe keeps climbing...

           EXT. LOLO TRAIL - DAY

           Howard’s men use AXES to cut their way across the trail,  
           inching forward at a snail’s pace. 

           Howard looks back at the dying animals in their wake. A 
           literal “trail of blood” as far as the eye can see...

           EXT. BITTERROOT MOUNTAINS - DAY

           A BALD EAGLE soars in the deep blue sky...

           The Nez Perce move along the steep mountain ridge, stunning 
           views in every direction. Joseph and Springtime ride beside 
           each other, staring at the horizon, ten thousand feet high.

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        Beautiful.

           Joseph looks at her, then nods. They keep riding...

           EXT. BITTERROOT MOUNTAINS - LATE AFTERNOON

           The tribe comes out of the mountains, descending towards the 
           BITTERROOT VALLEY. A SMALL TOWN, far in the distance, sits 
           nestled between thick forest and rolling hills.

           Looking Glass shouts to several members of his village...

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        There should be no trouble with the 
                        whites in this area! And you are 
                        not to cause any! They are not the 
                        ones who attacked us in Wallowa! 
                        They are not our enemy!

           Red Grizzly, riding nearby, looks over at Looking Glass.

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        You’re as foolish as Joseph. All 
                        whites are the enemy.

           Looking Glass doesn’t respond. Red Grizzly rides on ahead. 

           EXT. TOWN - LATER

           The street is empty. Buildings are boarded up. Everything is 
           quiet and still, like the calm expecting a storm. 
           People have locked themselves indoors. They cram close 
           together and nervously wait for the Indians to arrive...

           In the far distance, the Nez Perce come into view...

           The tribe pours into town like a great flood, filling the 
           entire width of the street! 

           People watch with amazement as hundreds of Indians fly past 
           their windows and pass through the town...

           A SALOON OWNER stands on his balcony and watches the tribe 
           move beneath him like a giant stampeding herd...

           PROSTITUTES peer out their bedroom windows with curious 
           smiles spread across their tired faces...

           Joseph rides down the street, making eye contact with those 
           who stare at him through boarded up windows...

           The remaining tribe members pass through the town. Residents 
           come outside and watch them grow small in the distance...

           EXT. BITTERROOT VALLEY - LATER

           The tribe rests after a long day’s march.

           Oyema sits quietly by herself...

           The old women approach. Oyema looks up. She knows what’s 
           coming and struggles as they take hold of her...

           They tear off her shirt and force her to expel the BREAST 
           MILK from her body. Oyema sobs -- devastated, heart-broken. 

           Those nearby watch with sympathy, knowing it must be done.

           The old women bind Oyema’s breasts with thick strips of 
           canvas, then they stand and leave, one at a time... 

           Oyema remains on the ground, sobbing... 

           Fairland kneels and gently strokes her sister’s hair...

           Nearby, Black Owl watches. Not sure what to do.

           EXT. BITTERROOT VALLEY - SAME TIME

           Looking Glass walks through the camp. 

           He discovers a few WARRIORS with some STORE BOUGHT GOODS. 

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        Where did you get those?
           The warriors stay silent. Looking Glass steps closer.

                                 LOOKING GLASS (CONT’D)
                        Where?

           INT. STORE - LATER

           The store has been ransacked. 

           A MOTHER hides beneath the counter with her TWO DAUGHTERS. 

           Her husband, the STORE OWNER, peers out the shattered windows 
           with a SHOTGUN in his hands...

           Out the window, Looking Glass comes into view...riding 
           towards the store with FIVE APPALOOSA PONIES in tow...

                                 STORE OWNER
                             (To Wife, Kids)
                        Stay down!

           Store Owner levels the shotgun and prepares to fire. 

           Looking Glass puts the ponies in the corral and then marks 
           each one with the store owner’s branding iron. 

           And then he climbs on his horse and rides away.

           Store Owner lowers his gun, amazed. 

           EXT. BITTERROOT VALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON

           The beautiful afternoon sun casts long shadows. 

           SETTLERS kneel beside their CHILDREN on the high bluffs and 
           watch the long Nez Perce train march into the twilight hours.

           A LITTLE GIRL waves. A distant WARRIOR waves back. The tribe 
           keeps moving -- deeper into Montana...

           EXT. STEAMBOAT “ROSEBUD” - DECK - MORNING

           General Sherman sits with his advisors, staring out towards 
           the southern bank of the Little Big Horn River. 

           In the distance, a new MILITARY FORT is under construction.

                                 ADVISOR
                        Better tell the boys to hurry 
                        building that thing. The Nez Perce 
                        might pop over that ridge any 
                        moment from what I hear...

           Nervous laughter all around. Sherman smiles. 
           A young SOLDIER approaches and hands him a message..

                                 SHERMAN
                        Thank you.

           Sherman opens the envelope and begins reading...

                                 ADVISOR
                        Anyway, I hear the Cheyenne 
                        campaign is winding down nicely. 
                        Last of the hold outs have been 
                        relocated to Oklahoma, “the hot 
                        place,” as they call it. The Crow 
                        and Blackfeet have been subdued. 
                        Even the Pawnee have been broken. 
                        As soon as we’ve dealt with this 
                        pesky Nez Perce rebellion, we can 
                        put the whole damn thing to rest...

                                 SHERMAN
                             (Re: Message)
                        Howard has lost more ground.

           An awkward moment. No one is surprised.

                                 ADVISOR
                        Well, I hate to say I told you so, 
                        sir, but...

                                 SHERMAN
                        It’s exactly what I wanted.

           Everyone looks around the table, confused.

                                 ADVISOR
                        I’m sorry, sir? Am I to understand 
                        you want the Nez Perce to escape?

                                 SHERMAN
                        No. I just want them to slow down. 
                        And the more Howard falls behind, 
                        the more likely that will happen. 
                             (Dramatic Beat)
                        It’ll give Gibbon more time to 
                        intercept them from the East.

           The table goes deathly quiet. BEAT.

                                 ADVISOR
                        Gibbon? Has he been dispatched?

                                 SHERMAN
                        I dispatched him before we left 
                        Washington to come here.
           Everyone absorbs the news, shocked.

                                 ADVISOR
                        My God. John Gibbon. Imagine what 
                        he’ll do to them.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Doesn’t matter. After all, the only 
                        good Indian is a dead Indian.

           Silence falls on the table and Sherman realizes that the 
           young soldier is still standing nearby at attention.

                                 SHERMAN (CONT’D)
                        That’ll be all, son.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Yes, sir.

           The soldier salutes and leaves. Sherman turns and stares 
           across the river at the new Fort being built. BEAT.

                                 ADVISOR
                        What’s the name?

           Sherman, lost in thought, is slow to respond.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Hmmm?

                                 ADVISOR
                        The new post. Have you decided on a 
                        name, yet?

                                 SHERMAN
                        Oh...yeah.

                        Fort Custer.

           EXT. BIG HOLE, MONTANA - SUNSET

           Two NEZ PERCE SCOUTS stand atop a high mountain summit and 
           survey the vast Montana Territory. Nothing in sight.

           EXT. BIG HOLE, MONTANA - NIGHT

           The Nez Perce dance around roaring fires, celebrating.

           Springtime finds Joseph sitting alone. She sits down beside 
           him and waits for him to look at her. 

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        What is troubling you?
                                 JOSEPH
                        The moon is high. They should be 
                        sleeping.

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        They are happy. So should you be.
                        Howard has not been seen for days. 
                        It’s over. We won.

           Joseph looks at her for a very long time. Then:

                                 JOSEPH
                        What did we win?

           Hold on Springtime. She can not answer.

           SUPER WIDE SHOT - The Nez Perce fires can be seen for miles.

           INT. ROOM - NIGHT

           COLONEL JOHN GIBBON (30s) comes into the pitch black room and 
           urgently awakens a SLEEPING SOLDIER...

                                 GIBBON
                        James! James! Get the men ready at 
                        once! We move out in an hour.

           Gibbon leaves. The soldier sits up and lights his bedside 
           lantern, revealing himself to be: 

           LIEUTENANT JAMES BRADLEY, the man who discovered Custer’s 
           slaughtered men at Little Big Horn.

           EXT. GIBBON’S CAMP - 2:30 A.M.

           300 AMERICAN SOLDIERS, James Bradley among them, stand at 
           attention as Colonel Gibbon addresses them:

                                 GIBBON
                        Our scouts have found the Nez Perce 
                        camp. Just twelve miles from here, 
                        in the Big Hole Valley. If we march 
                        right away, there’s a chance we can 
                        overtake them before sunrise.
                             (Beat)
                        I know you’re all tired. But we 
                        have been given our orders by 
                        General Sherman, himself. These 
                        fugitive Indians have slaughtered 
                        innocent Americans and now aim to 
                        join forces with the Sioux. And you 
                        all know what they’re capable of. 
                        It’s fallen on us to stop them.
                                 (MORE)
                                 GIBBON (CONT'D)
                             (Beat)
                        Let’s move out.

           And with that, Gibbon’s men march forward...

           EXT. STEAMBOAT “ROSEBUD” - DECK - SAME TIME

           The soldier who delivered Sherman’s message earlier stands on 
           the deck, unable to sleep, trying to light a cigarette...

                                 SHERMAN (O.S.)
                        Need a hand?

           The soldier turns, stunned. Sherman approaches, strikes one 
           of his own matches, and lights the boy’s cigarette. BEAT.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Thank you, sir. Couldn’t sleep.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Me neither.

           Sherman uses the same match to light his CIGAR...

                                 SOLDIER
                        They’re out there, somewhere, 
                        aren’t they? The Nez Perce?

           Sherman throws the match overboard and lets out a great big 
           puff of thick cigar smoke.

                                 SHERMAN
                        When the battle starts, we should 
                        be able to hear it.

                                 SOLDIER
                        You think Gibbon’s men will get 
                        there in time?

                                 SHERMAN
                        I do. Because there’s something 
                        fueling their legs that’s gonna 
                        make them march faster than any 
                        army on earth.

                                 SOLDIER
                        What’s that?

                                 SHERMAN
                        Revenge.
                             (Off Soldier’s look)
                        You don’t know who Colonel Gibbon 
                        is, do you, son?
           The soldier reluctantly shakes his head...

           EXT. FOREST - SAME TIME

           Gibbon’s men, profoundly determined, march through deep 
           forest towards the Big Hole Valley. OVER;

                                 SHERMAN (V.O.)
                        ...Colonel John Gibbon commands the 
                        7th Cavalry of the United States 
                        Army. He should’ve been with Custer 
                        when he made his final stand, but 
                        he was a day late. His men found 
                        the mutilated bodies. Friends. 
                        Brothers. For them, this is very 
                        personal. So they’ll get there. 
                        Over steep terrain, on empty 
                        stomachs and weary legs, they’ll 
                        get there. You can rest assured.

           As Sherman speaks, we see the resolute faces of Gibbon’s men. 
           And we know that Sherman is right. They’ll get there.

           EXT. STEAMBOAT “ROSEBUD” - DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Sherman takes another long puff on his cigar and then throws 
           it overboard. He turns back to the soldier.

                                 SHERMAN
                        I should get back to bed. I’m not 
                        as young as I once was. Goodnight.

           The soldier salutes. Sherman goes back inside. BEAT.

           EXT. BIG HOLE, MONTANA - NIGHT

           A brilliant FULL MOON hovers above the valley floor.

           INT. BLACK OWL’S TIPI- CONTINUOUS

           Oyema is talking in her sleep. Black Owl touches her gently on 
           the shoulder. She stops...

                                 BLACK OWL
                        What is it?

                                 OYEMA
                        I thought I heard the baby.

           Black Owl doesn’t know how to respond. He gets up and leaves.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - SAME TIME

           Black Owl comes outside. A few other warriors are up already. 
           SQUAWS begin to light their MORNING FIRES...

           INT. OLLOKOT’S TIPI - SAME TIME

           Fairland sleeps peacefully. Ollokot forces himself to get up.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - SAME TIME

           Wahlits stares at the necklace Little bird returned to him.

           INT. JOSEPH’S TIPI - SAME TIME

           Ollokot kneels and gently wakes his brother .

                                 OLLOKOT
                        It’s almost morning.

           Joseph nods and slowly gets to his feet...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Joseph and Ollokot walk through the camp. The number of 
           people up and about is quickly growing...

           Nobody senses danger on the far side of the valley floor...

           EXT. FOREST / MOUNTAIN SIDE - SAME TIME

           Gibbon’s army lies waiting, hidden in the trees.

           They load their RIFLES and fix BAYONETS. Nearby, SOLDIERS 
           work to assemble a HOWITZER CANON...

           The soldiers watch as the morning fires begin to light up the 
           hollow tipis like JACK-O-LANTERNS. One after another...

                                 SOLDIER
                        God, there’s hundreds of ‘em...

           The soldiers’ breathing grows heavy. Gibbon looks at his men.

                                 GIBBON
                        Get ready, boys.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - SAME TIME

           Joseph walks through the camp and approaches Black Owl.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Round up the horses.

           Black Owl jumps on his APPALOOSA HORSE and rides off towards 
           the HERD...in the same direction as Gibbon’s hidden army!
           EXT. FOREST / MOUNTAIN SIDE - SAME TIME

           Gibbon’s army watches Black Owl come closer...they level 
           their rifles, awaiting orders...

           Black Owl soars across the valley floor, the bright MOONLIGHT 
           keeping him in full view...

           Gibbon raises his hand...

           Black Owl gallops closer...

           Gibbon brings his hand down. 

           FORTY RIFLES fire at once! Black Owl’s body is torn apart. He 
           falls from his horse and hits the ground dead. BEAT.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - THAT MOMENT

           Everyone looks up, not sure what has just happened. A 
           terrifying, surreal moment hangs in the air...

           And then, from the distant trees, comes a MIGHTY YELL...

                                 SOLDIERS
                        FOR CUSTER!!!

           SMOKE fills the valley floor as hundreds of RIFLES explode. 

           The Americans charge, taking the Indians by surprise...

           So begins one of the bloodiest massacres in American history.

           The Battle of Big Hole, Montana

           The AMERICAN HOWITZER rains death from the hills above as 
           soldiers swarm the tipis, engaged in hand-to-hand combat. 

           Rifles and revolvers in full play. Bayonets slicing and 
           stabbing. Powder burns. Smoke-filled air and savage screams. 
           The ground covered with dead and dying women and children. 

           All as the surrounding tipis are set on fire...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Joseph grabs his family and heads for the river... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Toohoolhoolzote knocks a soldier down and cuts his throat.

           Red Grizzly fights with fury, killing one soldier after 
           another. He’s unstoppable.
           Looking Glass and the rest of the warriors fight as best they 
           can, but are quickly driven back by overwhelming numbers...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Absolute chaos. Figures dart in and out of the thick gun 
           smoke. Bullets fly in every direction. 

           Every few seconds, a howitzer canon shell explodes, tearing 
           bodies apart and showering the earth with blood and dirt.

           A SOLDIER sees one of his friends being dragged into a tipi. 

           He rushes in, kills the SQUAW who was about to kill his 
           friend, then runs a bayonet through a SCREAMING BABY...

           ...Only to be shot himself the next instant by a barrage of 
           gunfire ripping the tipi apart...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Little Bird is thrown to the ground by a soldier. She 
           struggles...about to be overwhelmed...when Wahlits suddenly 
           throws the soldier off her and dashes his brains with a rock. 

           Breathing heavy, Wahlits turns to face Little Bird. His eyes 
           grow wide. She has been shot in the chest! 

                                 LITTLE BIRD
                        Wahlits...

           She collapses into his arms. He lowers her gently to the 
           ground as the battle continues all around them...

                                 WAHLITS
                        I’m sorry...

           Little Bird gently touches his face. 

           And then a sudden EXPLOSION consumes them both.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Joseph hurries to get his family to safety... 

           He glances back at the raging battle, deeply conflicted. 

           Springtime looks at him. She understands.

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        Go and fight.

           Joseph hesitates, then nods.
                                 JOSEPH
                             (Re: Their daughter)
                        Get her to the river...

           And with that, Joseph heads back into the fray...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Yellow Wolf and Swan Lace race to safety. Yellow Wolf sees 
           the Howitzer on the hillside. He stops.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        What is it?

           Yellow Wolf looks around. He sees Fairland running nearby... 

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        Fairland!

           Fairland turns and runs over to them.

                                 YELLOW WOLF (CONT’D)
                             (To Swan Lace)
                        Go with Fairland...

                                 SWAN LACE
                        No. You’re coming with us...

           Fairland puts her arm around Swan Lace and pulls her away... 

                                 SWAN LACE (CONT’D)
                        No! Yellow Wolf!

           But he has already started running towards the howitzer!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Springtime and Noise of Running Feet run for their lives...

           Bullets whiz past their heads. Suddenly, Springtime is shot 
           twice! She falls to the ground and does not get back up. 

                                 NOISE OF RUNNING FEET
                        Mother! Mother!

           Noise of Running Feet desperately tries to jostle her awake, 
           but Springtime is unresponsive. 

                                 NOISE OF RUNNING FEET (CONT’D)
                             (Sobbing)
                        Mother! Get up, Mother!

           Springtime does not answer. The fury of battle continues... 
           Noise of Running Feet senses she must flee. She forces 
           herself to leave her mother and run away on her own... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Swan Lace and Fairland are cut down by gunfire. 

           They fall to the ground and roll to the bottom of the hill, 
           where they remain...lifeless.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Noise of Running Feet comes up over a hill and, suddenly, we 
           realize...she’s heading back towards the village!

           We follow her through the camp. People are dying all around 
           her. She somehow manages to make her way, unharmed...

           She reaches the charred remains of a TIPI and stops. 

           She finds HERMENE, her doll, lying on the ground. Burned but 
           still recognizable. She picks it up...

           Noise Running of Running Feet turns and takes in the 
           slaughter going on all around her. Fresh tears pour down her 
           face. She looks lost. And we realize why she came back: 

           She’s looking for her father...

           BOOM!! A Howitzer shell EXPLODES nearby and Noise of Running 
           Feet disappears into an ocean of smoke...

           The smoke clears and we find her STILL ALIVE, coughing, 
           bleeding, clutching her precious doll...

           She gets to her feet. And runs...heading for the river.

           Soldiers shoot at her, missing narrowly. 

           She reaches the river, clogged with bodies, both American and 
           Indian. She crawls into the waters and joins the corpses... 

           She floats down river, clutching her doll tightly as she 
           leaves the madness behind her...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Yellow Wolf charges through the chaos. He flags down a HORSE 
           and gallops towards the distant howitzer...

           BOOM! The horse rears up and falls down...Yellow Wolf hits 
           the ground hard, his leg pinned by the fallen horse. 

           Yellow Wolf reaches for his rifle, just beyond his grasp... 
           Soldiers fire all around him... 

           Desperate to free himself, Yellow Wolf draws his knife...

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                             (To Horse)
                        Sorry, my friend...

           He digs the knife into the horse’s back! 

           The horse kicks up. Yellow Wolf grabs his rifle and charges 
           for the howitzer, just a hundred yards up the hill...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Two SOLDIERS man the howitzer...

           Soldier #1 suddenly gets a bullet in the head! 

           His body crumples to the ground. Soldier #2 looks up just in 
           time to see Yellow Wolf bury a knife into his chest...

           Yellow Wolf turns to the howitzer and finds the fuse is 
           already burning! He throws all his weight against the canon 
           and manages to move its aim just as...BOOM!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The howitzer canon explodes into the American soldiers!!! 

           Everyone takes notice. A sudden shift in momentum. 

           Joseph and Looking Glass summon their men and charge back 
           into the village, overwhelming the battle-weary Americans...

           Toohoolhoolzote sees Gibbon retreating on his horse. He aims 
           his rifle...and fires! 

           Gibbon’s shoulder explodes in a puff of red. He falls off of 
           his horse and hits the ground.

           Toohoolhoolzote drops his gun, draws his knife, and charges 
           towards the American leader, screaming...

           An AMERICAN SOLDIER comes out of nowhere and buries his 
           bayonet in Toohoolhoolzote’s side!

           Toohoolhoolzote knocks the soldier down and kills him. 

           He removes the bayonet from his body with great pain.

           He may be dying, but he’s going to take the American leader 
           with him. He grabs Gibbon’s hair and steadies his knife...
           But then another American bayonet stabs Toohoolhoolzote in 
           the back. And then another. And another. 

           Half a dozen American soldiers surround Toohoolhoolzote and 
           stab him to death. They free Gibbon and join the RETREAT...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Joseph, Ollokot, and Looking Glass drive the remaining 
           Americans out of their village, screaming after them...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Yellow Wolf watches the Americans retreat. Slumped against 
           the howitzer canon, he struggles to catch his breath.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Warriors return to take in the aftermath...

           More than a hundred Nez Perce, mostly women and children, 
           have been slaughtered. And an equal number of American 
           soldiers litter the ground beside them.

           Little Big Horn was a ghastly sight, but this is worse. There 
           were no children at Big Horn, no dead women clutching babies 
           in their arms. The aftermath of Big Hole is horrifying.

           Joseph frantically searches for his family...

           He passes death with every footstep, reluctantly looking at 
           bodies, fearing each one might be his wife or daughter...

           Joseph comes down a hill and finds Yellow Wolf holding Swan 
           Lace in his arms. She’s badly wounded, but still alive...

                                 YELLOW WOLF (CONT’D)
                        I never should have left you...

           Swan Lace, in great pain, gently shakes her head...

                                 SWAN LACE
                        You turned the tide of battle... 
                             (Beat)
                        So much for arrows missing wide.

           Yellow Wolf manages a small laugh. BEAT.

           Nearby, Ollokot clutches Fairland’s dead body and sobs. 

           Joseph watches with profound heartache. 

                                 LOOKING GLASS (O.S.)
                        Joseph...
           Joseph turns to face Looking Glass.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What is it?

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        It’s Springtime.
                             (Beat)
                        She’s over here.

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - EVENING

           General Howard arrives to discover Gibbon’s camp turned into 
           a makeshift HOSPITAL filled with wounded and dying soldiers. 

           A handful of ARMY MEDICS struggle to save those they can...

           Howard finds Gibbon on a gurney in the middle of the room. 

                                 HOWARD
                        John...what happened?

           It takes Gibbon a long time to find words...

                                 GIBBON
                        The Indians...drove us back...we 
                        lost...so many men, I don’t know 
                        how many...really...I...

                                 MEDIC (O.S.)
                        I NEED A TOURNIQUET! SOMEBODY GET 
                        ME A TOURNIQUET!

           Howard looks up. A YOUNG SOLDIER is about to have his LEG 
           AMPUTATED...several soldiers hold him down...

           Howard unfastens his belt as he crosses the room... 

                                 HOWARD
                        Here. Use this.

           The medic glances at the belt.

                                 MEDIC
                        That’ll work.

           The restraining soldier takes the belt and wraps it tightly 
           around the young soldier’s wounded leg...

           The medic picks up a RUSTY SAW, caked with blood... 

                                 HOWARD
                        Give him something to bite down on.
           A small PIECE OF WOOD is placed in the soldier’s mouth. 

           The medic begins to operate, cutting the limb like firewood.

           EXT. HILLSIDE - SAME TIME

           Yellow Wolf stares at the distant American camp. He can hear 
           the soldier screaming as his leg is cut off.

           He turns and heads back to the Nez Perce camp...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           Joseph watches as MEDICINE MEN attend to Springtime. 

           Yellow Wolf cautiously approaches. BEAT.

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        Will she live?

                                 JOSEPH
                        They don’t know.

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                             (a respectful pause, then)
                        Howard is here.

           Joseph takes a deep breath, not sure what to say. 

           He suddenly sees something in the far distance...

           Noise of Running Feet is coming down the hill! Joseph runs 
           over and picks her up in his arms -- relieved beyond words.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Oh, I thought I’d lost you...

           He holds her tightly. She’s still wet from the river.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - LATER

           Joseph slowly walks through the camp... 

           Nearly everyone has been wounded. The air is filled with 
           death wails and funeral chants.

           Joseph discovers Little Bird’s mother, sobbing. Her daughter 
           is dead. An old woman, all alone. She has nothing and nobody.

           Joseph hears a BABY CRYING. He makes his way through the 
           bodies and discovers an infant in the arms of a DEAD MOTHER. 

           He stares down at the crying child. BEAT.
           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           Oyema sits, shaken and forlorn. She now mourns the death of 
           her husband and sister in addition to her child.

           Joseph approaches with the crying baby... 

           Oyema looks up and immediately understands. Without words, 
           she takes the child from Joseph and unbinds her breasts. 

           She puts the child’s mouth to her nipple. The crying stops.

           Joseph watches for a moment, then he turns and leaves.

           EXT. BIG HOLE BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

           Howard and Perry walk quietly among the fallen bodies. Perry 
           takes in the slaughter and slowly comes to a realization...

                                 PERRY
                        It was the plan all along, wasn’t 
                        it? We keep the Indians at a slow 
                        pace. Gibbon intercepts them and 
                        finishes the job. Sherman knew 
                        they’d be looking for revenge...

           Howard doesn’t answer. He stares at the bodies littering the 
           ground. So many women and children...

                                 HOWARD
                        You asked about Georgia? 
                             (Beat)
                        It was a lot like this.

           There is a slight RUSTLING SOUND. Howard looks up. 

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Stop that!!

           Up ahead - BANNOCK SCOUTS are scalping Nez Perce corpses! 
           Howard chases them away. He stops to catch his breath...

           Looking down, Howard suddenly freezes.

           He’s standing over the body of Toohoolhoolzote.

           Howard kneels beside the man he locked in prison, now dead 
           with vacant eyes. Howard gently closes them. BEAT.

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - LATER

           James Bradley is having a terrible nightmare...

           He finally bolts awake and breathes a long sigh of relief.
           EXT. NEARBY MEADOW - MOMENTS LATER

           Bradley leaves the camp and walks across the peaceful meadow, 
           trying to shake the ghosts from his mind... 

           He hears something up ahead. A distant, familiar sound. 

           And then Bradley abruptly stops...

           A RIDERLESS HORSE COVERED IN BLOOD! Standing alone in the 
           meadow, soaked in beautiful moonlight.

           Could this be the same horse from Little Big Horn? Is it even 
           real? Bradley can’t be sure. He approaches carefully and 
           gently strokes the animal’s mane. 

           Lost in a world of thought and fantasy, Bradley doesn’t hear 
           the galloping HORSE HOOVES approaching behind him...

           A SUDDEN, TERRIFYING SCREAM!

           Bradley turns around. A PIPE TOMAHAWK slams into his face! 

           Six Nez Perce warriors charge past Bradley’s corpse and 
           disappear into the night on a rampage of revenge...

           INT. SHERMAN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           General Sherman is reading a newspaper. The front page story 
           is all about Chief Joseph. The headline, in giant bold 
           letters, reads: “HEROIC RETREAT”. Sherman is not amused...

           A YOUNG SOLDIER nervously enters and sets another newspaper 
           down on Sherman’s desk. This one with an even bigger 
           headline: “RED NAPOLEON”.

           Sherman slowly lowers the first newspaper and picks up the 
           second. His brow furrows. He can’t take it anymore...

           In a sudden burst of anger, Sherman knocks everything off his 
           desk and onto the floor...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - DAWN

           Joseph watches as the tribe begins to move. Slowly, silently, 
           heads hanging low. Their spirits profoundly broken. 

           Nearby, Springtime sits on a horse. She looks pale and sick. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Can you ride?

           Springtime manages a nod. 
           EXT. MONTANA - AFTERNOON

           The tribe marches across the endless landscape...

           Looking Glass rides over to Joseph.

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        I need you to come with me.

           Joseph looks up at him. BEAT.

           EXT. CLEARING - LATER

           Joseph follows Looking Glass through thick forest trees 
           towards a CLEARING up ahead...

           They see the smoke first. And then the CABIN being consumed 
           by flames. Joseph dismounts, knowing what he’s about to see.

           He walks towards the burning house and then makes his way 
           around back where he finds a FAMILY OF FIVE slaughtered.

           Husband, wife, two teenage boys, one little girl. Flayed with 
           arrows. Dead on the ground and already beginning to rot.

           The little girl has an arrow through her head.

           Joseph stares at the bodies for a moment. Then, not saying a 
           word to Looking Glass, he turns and leaves...

           Joseph walks back to the woods and disappears behind some 
           trees...where he falls to the ground and begins to sob.

                                                           SLOW FADE TO:

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

           The Nez Perce tribe comes into the park and slowly makes its 
           way across the beautiful terrain...

           EXT. TARGHEE PASS - DAY

           The tribe comes over the pass and goes around HENRY LAKE, 
           moving deeper into Yellowstone. 

           The colors are beginning to turn. Fall quickly approaches.

           The Nez Perce look tired and wounded. This is no longer the 
           tribe that scaled the Bitterroot Mountains and crossed the 
           Snake River. These people are now staring into the gulf.

           EXT. OLD FAITHFUL - DAY

           The mighty GEYSER explodes into the sky. 
           Some Nez Perce regard it with wonder. Most are too tired to 
           notice. The tribe keeps moving...one painful step at a time.

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

           Joseph holds his daughter close and rides beside Springtime, 
           who jostles painfully as her horse moves forward. 

           Joseph waits for her to look at him. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Still with me?

           Springtime nods. But it’s unconvincing. 

           Joseph sees Red Grizzly riding nearby. The two men stare at 
           each other for a moment... 

           Joseph turns back to his family and keeps moving forward.

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

           Another day. More marching. Swan Lace suddenly falls to the 
           ground. She can no longer walk on her own. 

           Yellow Wolf bends over and picks her up in his arms.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        Put me down.

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        You can’t walk.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        I’m your mother. I carried you. You 
                        don’t carry me. Put me down.

           Yellow Wolf ignores her. He keeps walking. BEAT.

                                 SWAN LACE (CONT’D)
                        And how long do you think you can 
                        keep this up?

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        We’ll soon find out...

           He looks down at her. And then, the simple truth:

                                 YELLOW WOLF (CONT’D)
                        You’re all I have, too.

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - EVENING

           The tribe comes to a stop after a long day of marching. 
           An OLD WOMAN suddenly collapses from exhaustion. A few people 
           surround her, but it is too late. She is already dead.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - NIGHT

           Lit by fires, members of the tribe enact a smaller version of 
           the “funeral dance” - a somber, poetic display...

           Swan Lace watches intently, the fire bouncing off her face...

           Joseph, arms wrapped around Springtime, also watches. 

           Oyema sits nearby, gently rocking her new baby to sleep.

           Red Grizzly lurks in the shadows. He sees Ollokot standing a 
           few feet away. The two men stare at each other for a moment, 
           then Red Grizzly turns and disappears into the darkness.

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - MORNING

           Howard rides next to Perry, leading his army through the 
           park. The soldiers and their horses seem tired.

           The wind blows. Perry looks up at the grey skies...

                                 PERRY
                        Wind’s getting colder...
                        Seasons are turning.

           Howard remains quiet. The Americans keep moving forward...

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

           Yellow Wolf, exhausted from carrying Swan Lace, falls to the 
           ground. The tribe keeps moving past them... 

           Yellow Wolf tries to pick her up. She resists.

                                 SWAN LACE
                        Leave me.

           He tries again. She slaps his face. Hard.

                                 SWAN LACE (CONT’D)
                        Leave me, I said.

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        Why?!

                                 SWAN LACE
                        You know why. Now, go.

           She turns away, refusing to look him in the eye. 
                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        Mother, please! Mother! 

           She keeps looking away, stone-faced and resolute. Refusing to 
           even look at her son. Yellow Wolf starts to cry...

           Looking Glass finally steps forward and pulls him away...

                                 YELLOW WOLF (CONT’D)
                        No! Mother! No!

           Swan Lace keeps looking down. But as soon as Yellow Wolf has 
           disappeared around the bend, she looks up... 

           And we can tell that her heart is breaking...

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATER

           Joseph rides up beside Springtime. Overwhelmed by pain, she 
           looks at him -- quietly pleading for some kind of relief. 

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        I’m cold...

           Joseph tries to rub her shoulders for warmth. 

                                 NOISE OF RUNNING FEET (O.S.)
                        I’m cold, too...

           Joseph looks down at his daughter with aching eyes. There is 
           nothing he can do -- and it’s breaking his heart.

           Suddenly, GUNSHOTS are heard up ahead...Joseph kicks his 
           horse and gallops towards the front of the line...

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - CONTINUOUS

           TWO WHITE MEN, carrying MAPS and surveying equipment, are 
           forced to their knees as Nez Perce warriors surround them. 

           Joseph climbs off his horse and slowly approaches...

                                 OLLOKOT
                             (To Joseph)
                        They were sleeping when we came 
                        upon them. They fired first. They 
                        always fire first.

           Joseph looks at the two men, now trembling with fear...

                                 MAN #1
                        Please, don’t kill us. We don’t 
                        mean no harm. We thought you aimed 
                        to steal our goods...
                                 JOSEPH
                             (In English)
                        Who are you? Why are you here?

                                 MAN #1
                        We’re on assignment...we’re 
                        cartographers. We make maps.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (Confused)
                        Maps?

                                 MAN #1
                        That’s right. 
                             (To Man #2)
                        Show him, Harold.

           Man #2 (HAROLD) opens his case and pulls out a dozen hand-
           drawn maps. Joseph studies them carefully. BEAT.  

                                 HAROLD
                             (Suddenly realizes)
                        You’re Chief Joseph, aren’t you?

           Joseph doesn’t answer. He hands the maps to Ollokot and 
           Looking Glass. As they discuss, Harold turns to Man #1...

                                 HAROLD (CONT’D)
                        He’s the one who’s been in all the 
                        papers! I told you we needed to 
                        leave this place, Martin...
                             (Beat)
                        The minute we saw soldiers, we 
                        should’ve known there was trouble!

           Joseph, Ollokot, and Looking Glass stop talking. They look 
           over at Harold with sudden interest. Soldiers?

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATER

           Harold spreads one of his maps out on the ground. Joseph 
           kneels. Looking Glass and Ollokot stand nearby.

                                 HAROLD
                        Saw ‘em about three days ago, 
                        heading west...

                                 JOSEPH
                             (In English)
                        Where?

                                 HAROLD
                             (Points)
                        Here. And here.
           Ollokot and Looking Glass exchange a nervous glance.

                                 JOSEPH
                        How many?

                                 HAROLD
                        Five hundred, maybe more.

           Joseph stares at the map -- deep in thought. Then he stands 
           to face Ollokot and Looking Glass.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        If that man is telling the truth, 
                        we’ll run right into them.

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        Howard’s coming from behind. Can’t 
                        turn around. We’re trapped.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        We can’t face another army. How 
                        many times can we fight and win?

           Frustrated, Ollokot storms off. Looking Glass watches him go, 
           then turns back to face Joseph...

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                             (Re: Harold and Martin)
                        What should we do with them?

           Joseph hesitates, unsure. 

           And then Red Grizzly suddenly steps forward...

                                 RED GRIZZLY
                        Kill them! Did you learn nothing at 
                        Big Hole? All whites are the enemy! 

           Ollokot stands nearby, a rage building inside of him...

                                 RED GRIZZLY (CONT’D)
                        They’ll tell the soldiers where we 
                        are! There is no difference between 
                        one group of whites and another. 
                        Kill them. They would not think 
                        twice about killing you.

           Before Joseph can respond, Ollokot suddenly steps forward and 
           forces the two men back to their knees. 

           He starts to load his rifle. Joseph approaches -- alarmed.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What are you doing, brother?
                                 OLLOKOT
                        They’ll warn the soldiers, Joseph. 
                        Red Grizzly is right. He was always 
                        right. I see that now.

           Martin tries to stand. Ollokot kicks him to the ground. The 
           two men tremble, sensing the end is near...

           Those nearby seem conflicted by what’s happening. Frantic 
           glances are exchanged as the tension mounts... 

                                 JOSEPH
                        We do not kill women and innocent 
                        men. That has never been our way.
                             (Steps closer)
                        Ollokot, they are not the ones who 
                        killed your wife.

           Ollokot hesitates, then raises his gun to fire...

           ...But Joseph grabs the barrel and places it against his own 
           chest, right over his heart!

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Now you pull the trigger and kill 
                        me first. I would give up my own 
                        life to undo the killing of white 
                        men by my people. Because now we 
                        are no better than they are!

           Joseph pushes hard on the rifle. Ollokot stumbles backwards. 
           Everyone is speechless. The dust slowly settles... 

                                 HAROLD
                        Um...Chief?

           Joseph looks down at Harold. BEAT.

                                 HAROLD (CONT’D)
                        There’s something...we could show 
                        you that...might...be useful.

           Joseph hesitates, then slowly kneels. Harold grabs his map 
           and carefully wipes the dirt away.

                                 HAROLD (CONT’D)
                        There’s a gulch about three miles 
                        from here. Nobody knows about it. 
                        It’s a thousand feet down and real 
                        narrow. One, maybe two body lengths 
                        wide, tops. If you can get there, 
                        it’ll take you out of the park. The 
                        soldiers will never see you... 
                        You’ll go right under ‘em.
           Joseph stares at the map and slowly nods. He looks up and 
           finds Harold holding a picture of his family...

                                 HAROLD (CONT’D)
                        Sir, please...I got a wife and a 
                        little girl. I just want to see ‘em 
                        again, I’m begging you...

           Joseph holds up his hand and Harold stops talking. Joseph 
           stares at him for a lingering moment, then faintly nods. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Go.

           Harold and Martin hesitate, then they leap to their feet and 
           charge into the woods as fast as their legs will carry them.

           Hold on Joseph -- staring at the map...

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATER

           Harold and Martin, lucky to be alive, run for their lives 
           through the thick forest trees...

                                 SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

           Harold and Martin stop dead in their tracks. Who said that?

           TWENTY AMERICAN SOLDIERS reveal themselves -- hidden in the 
           trees, guns raised. The men breath a sigh of relief.

           EXT. CLARK’S FORK CANYON - LATER

           Joseph leads the tribe into the gulch of Clark’s Fork Canyon 
           ...so narrow that two horses can barely walk abreast. Looking 
           Glass rides up beside Joseph...

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        Are you sure about this?

           Joseph doesn’t answer. He keeps pressing forward.

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

           Swan Lace lies dead on the ground. 

           General Howard dismounts. A few SOLDIERS gather behind him.

                                 SOLDIER
                        They’re leaving their elderly 
                        behind. Won’t be long now. 

           Howard stares at Swan Lace for a long, sad moment. 
                                 HOWARD
                        Alright. Let’s go.

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - EVENING

           Harold and Martin are led through the thick trees towards a 
           clearing up ahead...where a LARGE ARMY has made camp... 

           INT. MILES’ TENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Harold and Martin are shown inside. A COLONEL and several 
           MILITARY ADVISORS are waiting for them...

                                 SOLDIER
                        These are the men we told you 
                        about, sir...

           The Colonel turns around, revealing himself to be: 

           NELSON A. MILES - the man who bought General Howard a cup of 
           coffee back in Washington.

                                 MILES
                        Wonderful. 
                             (To Harold & Martin)
                        Have a seat.

           INT. MILES’ TENT - LATER

           Harold and Martin sit with Miles and his advisors -- a map of 
           Yellowstone spread out between them.

                                 MILES
                        You’re sure they went this way?

           Harold and Martin both nod.

                                 ADVISOR
                        Sir, you know what this means? 
                        They’ve made it into northern 
                        Montana. There’s nothing standing 
                        between them and Canada, now.

                                 MILES
                        Sure, but the country’s wide open 
                        from this point on. As far as the 
                        eye can see. No place to hide.

           Miles stares at the map with a faint smile.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Tell the boys to get ready... 
                             (Beat)
                        The chase is on.
           EXT. NORTHERN MONTANA - DAY

           The Nez Perce come out of the gulch at CLARK’S FORK CANYON. 
           Every direction is as far as the eye can see. The weather is 
           growing colder, darker -- threatening bring snow any moment.

           EXT. NORTHERN MONTANA - EVENING

           Joseph stands on a hillside overlook with TWO SCOUTS.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Now that the country is flat, it is 
                        important to be on the lookout for 
                        people. A stampeding herd, a flock 
                        of birds changing course...those 
                        are the signs to watch for. If you 
                        see soldiers, then it’s too late.

           The Scouts nod, then stare out at the empty landscape. 

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - NIGHT

           The freezing Nez Perce exhale visible breath into the night 
           air. Joseph wraps his arms around Noise of Running Feet.

                                 NOISE OF RUNNING FEET
                        I’m so cold. Can’t we light a fire?

                                 JOSEPH
                        No, the soldiers would be able to 
                        see it. Try to sleep. Morning will 
                        be here soon.

           Noise of Running Feet closes her eyes. Joseph looks up at 
           Springtime -- her eyes are growing vacant... 

           Nearby, Ollokot sees Oyema struggling to keep her baby warm. 
           He offers her his blanket. She hesitates, then takes it. 

                                 OYEMA
                        Thank you.

           Ollokot nods. Staring at the child, he tries to forget about 
           his sorrow and the terrible cold piercing his body.

           EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - MORNING

           The Nez Perce cross the Missouri River, tired and hungry. 

           Light rain pours down on them. It’s cold. Joseph and Looking 
           Glass glance up at the sky...

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        Don’t snow...
           Near the back of the line, an OLD WOMAN falls down...dead. 
           The tribe keeps moving, unable to stop. We slowly PAN UP to 
           reveal a DOZEN BODIES scattered in the distance.

           EXT. NORTHERN MONTANA - LATE AFTERNOON

           The tribe keeps marching through the cold wind and rain. 
           Joseph sees a group of INDIAN RIDERS in the far distance. 

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        Crow?

           Joseph nods. BEAT.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - NIGHT

           Joseph and Looking Glass sit with the CROW WARRIORS. 

                                 CROW WARRIOR
                        We come with good news. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        We could use some.

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        We need food. And clothes. Anything 
                        you can spare.

           The Crow Warriors glance at each other, confused.

                                 CROW WARRIOR
                        No. We do not mean...we can not 
                        help you. Not like that.
                             (Beat)
                        There are too many whites. Since 
                        Yellow Hair was killed, there have 
                        been more soldiers. More forts. The 
                        whites are everywhere and more are 
                        coming each day. The white man has 
                        great power. His voice travels 
                        faster than the wind and his iron 
                        monster takes red men to The Hot 
                        Place where they die.

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        I don’t understand. You said you 
                        brought good news? What is it?

                                 CROW WARRIOR
                             (dramatic beat, then)
                        Sitting Bull has returned.

           Joseph suddenly looks up. This is big news.
                                 CROW WARRIOR (CONT’D)
                        It is only a rumor. But we believe 
                        he is nearby. Find him. You have 
                        come so far and risked so much. 
                        Your lives. The future of your 
                        people. And you are so close.

           Joseph hesitates, then slowly nods as the cold wind blows...

           EXT. NORTHERN MONTANA - NIGHT

           Miles and his men ride under the cover of night. The sky 
           begins to lighten with impending dawn... 

                                 MILES
                        Prepare to make camp against that 
                        hill over there. Tell the men -- no 
                        tents, no fires -- nothing that can 
                        be seen from a distance. Everyone 
                        must sleep against the hillside and 
                        keep out of sight.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Yes, sir.

           The soldier rides ahead to dispatch the orders. 

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - DAWN

           The sun begins to rise. The camp awakens and prepares to 
           leave. On the hillside, two scouts look across the plains... 

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Over there!

           There are figures, tiny dots, in the far distance...

                                 SCOUT #2
                        Buffalo...

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Or people?

           Scout #2 shakes his head, unsure. 

           EXT. NORTHERN MONTANA - AFTERNOON

           The Nez Perce march across the landscape. Rain has turned to 
           sleet. It’s freezing cold. Joseph rides with Noise of Running 
           Feet in his arms, shielding her as best he can.

           Springtime rides beside them, jostling with pain.

           Yellow Wolf and Looking Glass brace against the cold. 
           Oyema keeps her baby bundled close. Ollokot rides beside her, 
           doing what he can to protect her from the cold wind.

           SCOUTS appear over the horizon... 

           Joseph and Looking Glass meet them half way.

                                 SCOUT
                        No sign of Sitting Bull.

                                 JOSEPH
                        And the soldiers?

                                 SCOUT
                        No sign of them either.

           Joseph nods. The Scouts ride away. BEAT. 

           EXT. NORTHERN MONTANA - EVENING

           The tribe comes over a small bluff. In the far distance, 
           silhouetted mountains appear. Looking Glass stares with 
           disbelief as his face fills with recognition...

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        Canada...

           Everyone looks up, exhausted and amazed. They’ve made it.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - NIGHT

           Springtime sleeps, her breathing heavy and labored. 

           Joseph watches with concern. He lifts her shirt to check her 
           wounds...and discovers they’ve turned gangrenous. 

           Knowing there is nothing he can do, Joseph lowers her shirt 
           and puts his blanket around her. 

           Then he gets to his feet and leaves...

           He finds Ollokot standing at the edge of camp. Together, the 
           two brothers stare into the darkness. BEAT.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        How is Springtime?

           Joseph shakes his head. This question is beyond him.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Still here. Still breathing.

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Good. That’s good.
           A cold wind blows. The brothers stand in silence.

                                 OLLOKOT (CONT’D)
                        What do we do in Canada, Joseph?

           Joseph stares at his brother, confused.

                                 OLLOKOT (CONT’D)
                        Can we talk to the American Chief? 
                        Make him understand it was the 
                        young warriors who did the killing? 
                        That we tried to surrender at White 
                        Bird? Do you think he will ever let 
                        us return to Wallowa?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I don’t know. I think...that...

           Joseph suddenly stops. Over Ollokot’s shoulder comes a 
           flickering light...An OLD WOMAN has started a FIRE!

           Joseph and Ollokot charge through the camp. Reaching the 
           fire, they begin to frantically stomp it out...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SUPER WIDE SHOT - The small fire can be seen for miles! It 
           flickers for a brief moment, then disappears into darkness.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Smoke rises from the extinguished fire... 

           Joseph and Ollokot look down at the OLD WOMAN. It’s Little 
           Bird’s mother. She sobs...

                                 LITTLE BIRD’S MOTHER
                        Please...I’m so cold...

           Joseph and Ollokot slowly peer out into the darkness...

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Do you think anybody saw?

           Joseph shakes his head, not sure.

           EXT. NORTHERN MONTANA - THAT MOMENT

           MILES AWAY - A BANNOCK SCOUT comes out of the darkness and 
           looks down at the Nez Perce camp. 

           We can tell by the look on his face: He saw the fire.
           INT. MILES’ TENT - LATER

           Colonel Miles looks up at the Bannock Scout. BEAT.

                                 MILES
                        You’re sure?

           The Bannock Scout nods. Miles turns to his AIDE.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Ready the troops. We leave at once.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - DAWN

           The Nez Perce awaken and gather their things.

           Ollokot and Oyema exchange a look as they get ready.

           Joseph gently nudges Springtime. She doesn’t wake. For a 
           moment, he’s scared she has died. Then her eyes flicker open.

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        Still here.

           Joseph sighs with relief.

           Nearby, Yellow Wolf helps Little Bird’s Mother stand up.

                                 YELLOW WOLF 
                        Come on, up we go. Just one more 
                        day and it’ll all be over...

           EXT. BEAR PAW, MONTANA - SAME TIME

           The two scouts stare out across the plains. Bad weather makes 
           it difficult to see. A HERD OF BUFFALO roam three miles away.

                                 SCOUT #2
                        See? Told you it was buffalo...

           Scout #1 nods, relieved.

                                 SCOUT #2 (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Let’s go.

           The scouts stand and walk away...Scout #1 realizes he’s 
           forgotten something and turns back.

           He bends over and picks his telescope off the ground. He 
           looks up...and his face floods with panic.

           The herd of buffalo is stampeding!
           Scout #1 looks through his telescope. SOLDIERS! Hundreds of 
           them on horses. Full gallop and approaching fast...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           The two scouts come riding into camp...

                                 SCOUTS
                        SOLDIERS ARE COMING!!!

           Order in the camp fragments as warriors prepare for battle. 

           And then a strange sound rises in the distance, like thunder, 
           growing louder and louder by the second... 

           Hundreds of blue uniforms pour around the bluff as the BUGLER 
           blows his horn... “CHARGE!”

           The Battle of Bear Paw, Montana

           Joseph puts Noise of Running Feet on a horse...

                                 JOSEPH
                        You ride north until you hear 
                        gunfire no longer! Understand? 

           Noise of Running Feet nods, terrified. Joseph slaps the horse 
           and it takes off, carrying her away... 

           Joseph races over to Springtime. He picks her up in his arms 
           and flees for safety as guns explode all around them...

           Warriors form a protective perimeter around the camp, holding 
           the soldiers at bay. There is no hand-to-hand combat here, 
           but instead a brutal exchange of gunfire as the Nez Perce 
           fortify defenses and get the women and children to safety...

           The carnage, though, is unmistakable and unrelenting. On par 
           with Big Hole. Soldiers and Indians die in droves as bullets 
           slam into living bodies and send them falling to the earth...

           Joseph reaches the safety of the perimeter. Gasping for 
           breath, he gently lowers Springtime to the ground.

                                 SPRINGTIME
                        Where is our daughter...?

           Joseph shakes his head -- unable to answer...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Noise of Running Feet gallops through the battlefield as 
           bullets whiz past her head... 
           Without looking back, she charges forward into the endless 
           rolling plains of northern Montana...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Yellow Wolf looks across the landscape and sees “the big 
           picture” Soldiers swarm the battlefield in two circling 
           wings, surrounding the Nez Perce Camp...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The Americans attempt a charge, but the Nez Perce have dug in 
           and are ready for them. They unleash a volley of gunfire. 

           The soldiers who survive retreat back to their lines...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Ollokot sees Oyema running with her adopted baby. 

           She stumbles and falls. He goes to her and helps her up. They 
           run towards the safety of the Nez Perce perimeter...

           Ollokot is suddenly shot in the back!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Joseph watches with horror as his brother drops to his knees.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Coughing blood, Ollokot nudges Oyema forward...

                                 OLLOKOT
                        Hurry! Go!

           Another bullet slams into his back, killing him. 

           Horrified, Oyema turns and runs for her life...

           Ollokot’s body remains where it fell - among a HUNDRED OTHERS 
           littering a stretch of ground soon to be called No Mans Land.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Oyema and her baby reach safety. She collapses, trembling. 
           Nearby, Joseph watches -- devastated. 

           The smoke starts to clear. The gunfire grows less. And the 
           reality of STALEMATE begins to sink in on both sides...

           EXT. NORTHERN MONTANA - LATER

           Noise of Running Feet brings her horse to a stop. 
           All alone in the empty landscape, she can no longer hear the 
           sound of gunfire. The wind blows, cold and lonely... 

           Not sure what to do, she kicks her horse and keeps riding. 
           Towards what, we can only imagine...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - NIGHT

           The Nez Perce have dug in for the night. 

           Warriors sit in rifle pits, staring across No Man’s Land 
           towards the distant American forces. Women and children work 
           to bury the dead. The elderly watch with profound sadness.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - LATER

           Joseph kneels and sketches a map in the dirt. Yellow Wolf and 
           five WARRIORS stand nearby, watching...

                                 JOSEPH
                        There are two places where a rider 
                        might be able to slip past the 
                        white man’s forces...
                             (Points)
                        Here. And here.
                             (Looks up at them)
                        Sitting Bull is nearby. Find him. 
                        Tell him to come here and help us. 

           Yellow Wolf and the warriors slowly nod. Nearby, Red Grizzly 
           eavesdrops -- sensing another opportunity.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - NIGHT

           Looking Glass sits with Springtime, caring for her. Joseph 
           approaches. The two men grab their rifles... 

           Joseph lays a gentle hand on Springtime’s shoulder.

           And then, reluctantly, Joseph leaves with Looking Glass.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - NIGHT

           Yellow Wolf climbs on his horse. Joseph approaches. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH
                        My daughter is out there.

           Yellow Wolf stares at his Chief, then slowly nods.

                                 YELLOW WOLF
                        I’ll look for her.

           Joseph nods, “Thank you,” then turns and walks away. 
           The other five warriors sit on their horses, waiting. 

           Red Grizzly climbs on his horse, as well...

           Joseph, Looking Glass, and the remaining warriors fire their 
           guns at the Americans. 

           Yellow Wolf and the warriors kick their horses, charging into 
           the darkness. Red Grizzly rides into the fray, as well...

           The Americans see the escaping warriors and fire!

           Three Nez Perce Warriors fall victim to gunfire. Yellow Wolf 
           and one other WARRIOR make it through safely... 

           Red Grizzly escapes, too. He rides into the darkness, leaving 
           the misery of his people behind him...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Joseph slowly lowers his smoking rifle. He nods to Looking 
           Glass, then stands and walks away...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           Joseph walks over to Springtime and kneels beside her. She 
           glances up with weary eyes. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH
                        There is still hope.

                                                               FADE TO BLACK

           EXT. BEAR PAW, MONTANA - EARLY MORNING

           Morning mist lingers in the air as GUNFIRE erupts. 

           Surrounded by so much beauty, it is almost surreal to see 
           puffs of smoke coming from distant rifles...

           The Americans trade shots with the Nez Perce. A virtual 
           stalemate. And everyone knows it...

           INT. MILES’ TENT - SAME TIME

           Frustrated, Miles looks at his ADVISORS.

                                 MILES
                        We’re the third army to go up 
                        against these people. We should not 
                        be in a stalemate with more than 
                        seventy of our men dead on the 
                        ground before us!
                                 ADVISOR
                        Sir, we have them surrounded. All 
                        we have to do is wait them out.

                                 MILES
                        With Sitting Bull in the area? I’m 
                        told two warriors on horses broke 
                        through our lines last night, 
                        they’ll lead the Sioux right to us. 
                        We don’t have time to wait them 
                        out. We need to win and get the 
                        hell out of here. Now.

           Miles stands and leaves. 

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - SAME TIME

           Miles comes outside, deep in thought. The wind blows cold, 
           ominous. Miles looks to the sky, as do other soldiers...

           And then it begins to snow...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - SAME TIME

           Peaceful snow flakes that spell doom for the already freezing 
           Nez Perce quietly fall to the ground. 

           Members of the tribe huddle together, desperate for warmth.

           Looking Glass glances up at the sky...Oyema shields her baby 
           ...Joseph wraps his arms around Springtime... 

           EXT. NO MAN’S LAND - SAME TIME

           The snow covers the dead with a soft layer of white. Blood 
           soaks the snow red. Ollokot’s body is slowly buried... 

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - SAME TIME

           Miles turns to a nearby SOLDIER.

                                 MILES
                        Has the howitzer been set up?

                                 SOLDIER
                        Yes, sir.

                                 MILES
                             (a moment, then)
                        Wheel it into position.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - LATER

           Through pouring snow comes the sound of SQUEEKING WHEELS... 
           Joseph and Looking Glass glance up. Across the battlefield, 
           they see the HOWITZER CANON being wheeled into position...

           Remembering Big Hole, their faces drop...

                                 JOSEPH / LOOKING GLASS
                        Get down!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - THAT MOMENT

           Miles stares out at the Nez Perce camp...

                                 MILES
                        Fire!

           BOOM! The HOWITZER CANNON fires through the falling snow... 

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Oyema clutches her baby...Looking Glass shields a YOUNG GIRL 
           ...Joseph throws his body over Springtime...

           BOOM! The canon shell explodes in the middle of camp...

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Miles is unrelenting.

                                 MILES
                        Fire!
                             (BOOM!)
                        Fire!
                             (BOOM!)
                        Fire!
                             (BOOM!)
                        Fire!

           Soldiers watch the distant explosions as the snow continues 
           to fall thick and heavy... 

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           An explosion consumes a GRANDMOTHER and her small CHILD. 

           Everyone stays down, knowing the next instant could be their 
           last. Screams and cries fill the camp...

           BOOM! Another explosion. BOOM! And another. Each one more 
           terrible than the last. Finally, we:

                                                           CUT TO BLACK:
           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - NIGHT

           The bombardment has stopped. 

           But the crying continues. And the snow keeps falling, covering 
           the dead and wounded laying on the ground...

           EXT. NO MAN’S LAND - NIGHT

           A few brave WARRIORS strip dead bodies of ammunition. One 
           slices open the belly of a horse for food.

           RIFLES SUDDENLY CRACK! One warrior falls dead... 

           The others hurry back to the safety of the perimeter...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Oyema sits with her baby, staring out at No Man’s Land. She 
           suddenly sees something strange...

           One of the soldiers lying on the ground is moving...

           Oyema hesitates, then hands her baby to a nearby WOMAN. 

           EXT. NO MAN’S LAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Oyema steps lightly through the bodies. She approaches the 
           wounded SOLDIER and kneels beside him. 

           He’s young, freezing, and scared to die. Oyema looks down at 
           him with compassion...

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - SAME TIME

           C.S. WOOD (35) sits near the front line, staring out at No Mans 
           Land, trying to keep warm. MILAN TRIPP (18) approaches...

                                 WOOD
                        How’s it going, kid?

                                 TRIPP
                        I could be better.

                                 WOOD
                        Yeah? Well, you’re alive. Which 
                        means you could also be worse.

           Tripp grunts, then suddenly raises his rifle...

                                 WOOD (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?
                                 TRIPP
                        I see one of ‘em out there!

                                 WOOD
                        Where?

                                 TRIPP
                        There!

           Wood looks out at the battlefield and sees Oyema...

                                 TRIPP (CONT’D)
                        I think she’s gonna scalp him!

                                 WOOD
                        Nez Perce don’t take scalps. You 
                        fire that thing, you might hit our 
                        guy, too. You think about that?

           Tripp’s rifle trembles in his hands. He’s nervous and cold.

           EXT. NO MAN’S LAND - SAME TIME

           Oyema takes the BLANKET she has wrapped around herself and 
           lays it over the dying soldier. 

           With snow falling softly around them, surrounded by scores of 
           bodies frozen to the earth, Oyema gently touches the boy’s 
           face with her hand. He looks up at her with terrified eyes...

                                 OYEMA
                        Poor boy... 
                             (Beat)
                        You are too young to die.

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - SAME TIME

           Wood slowly turns to Tripp.

                                 WOOD
                        You gonna shoot her for giving him 
                        a blanket?

           Slowly, Tripp lowers his rifle.

           EXT. NO MAN’S LAND - SAME TIME

           The young soldier is dead, the blanket already wet from snow 
           and red with blood. Oyema stares at his peaceful face, then 
           she slowly stands and walks back to the Nez Perce camp.

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - SAME TIME

           Wood and Tripp watch Oyema leave...
                                 WOOD
                        Relax, kid. They’ll be plenty of 
                        Indians to kill tomorrow.

           The snow keeps falling. BEAT.

                                 WOOD (CONT’D)
                        God, it’s cold. I don’t know about 
                        you, but I didn’t sign up to freeze 
                        my ass off in the middle of 
                        northern Montana.

                                 TRIPP
                        Somebody’s gotta do it.

                                 WOOD
                             (a moment, then)
                        If you say so, kid.

           Wood turns back and stares out at No Man’s Land. Tripp looks 
           down, terrible thoughts racing through his head... 

                                 TRIPP
                        What if Sitting Bull comes? What if 
                        his five thousand warriors show up 
                        in the morning?

                                 WOOD
                        You shouldn’t worry about things 
                        you can’t control.

                                 TRIPP
                        I don’t want to die.

                                 WOOD
                        Calm down. General Howard’s due to 
                        arrive here any minute.

                                 TRIPP
                        Yeah...but who will get here first?

           And on this lingering question, we:

                                                          FADE TO BLACK:

           EXT. BEAR PAW, MONTANA - EARLY MORNING

           The sun creeps over the horizon, revealing a battlefield 
           blanketed in white. And it’s still snowing...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - MORNING

           A WHITE FLAG is raised in the distance.
           Joseph, Looking Glass, and members of the tribe take notice. 
           Difficult to see through the snow, it’s meaning unmistakable.

           Several SOLDIERS approach and get within earshot...

                                 SOLDIER
                             (Shouting)
                        COLONEL MILES WISHES TO SPEAK WITH 
                        CHIEF JOSEPH!

           Joseph glances at Looking Glass. BEAT.

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - SAME TIME

           C.S. Wood, fast asleep, suddenly bolts awake. He looks 
           around, relieved by the silence.

                                 WOOD
                        See, kid, what did I tell you? 
                        Morning’s here and Sitting Bull is 
                        nowhere to be found...
                             (Realizes he is alone)
                        Kid?

           EXT. NEARBY THE NEZ PERCE CAMP - SAME TIME

           Milan Tripp crawls on his belly, attempting to get a closer 
           look at the Nez Perce camp. He sticks his head up and stares 
           down at the fortifications. 

           But then the click of a rifle hammer makes him turn around. 
           He’s surrounded by WARRIORS. Caught, red-handed.

           INT. MILES’ TENT - LATER

           Miles looks up as Joseph enters.

                                 MILES
                        I didn’t think you’d come.

           Miles motions to a chair. Joseph hesitates, then sits. BEAT.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - SAME TIME

           Milan Tripp, now a prisoner, stares at the suffering camp. 
           The Nez Perce offer him what little food they have left. 
           Milan Tripp eats, glancing again at the layout of the camp. 

           He has a much better view from here...

           INT. MILES’ TENT - SAME TIME

           Joseph and Miles sit in silence, each waiting for the other 
           to speak. Finally, Miles leans forward...
                                 MILES
                        You speak English?
                             (Joseph nods)
                        Can I get you anything? Some food 
                        or...water, perhaps?

           Joseph shakes his head, then nods at Miles’ uniform...

                                 JOSEH
                        Your coat...is not like Howard’s. 
                        He has stars on his shoulder...

                                 MILES
                        I know. And double brass buttons. 
                        It’s because he’s a general.

                                 JOSEH
                        And what are you?

                                 MILES
                        I’m the man who caught you.
                             (Beat)
                        Don’t you think this whole thing 
                        has gone on long enough? Do you 
                        think I enjoy launching canon fire 
                        into your camp? 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Then stop doing it. 

                                 MILES
                        Alright. Sure. And what exactly do 
                        you propose I do instead?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Go home to your families. We are 
                        not at war and we are not your 
                        enemy. You should let us go.

                                 MILES
                        You know I can’t do that. I have my 
                        orders. You are fugitives and must 
                        surrender, unconditionally. 
                        Otherwise, I’ll be forced to 
                        continue what I’m doing. And let me 
                        be clear. I will pound you into 
                        oblivion. Your women and children 
                        will die, screaming in agony. It’ll 
                        be awful. But I won’t stop. I’ll 
                        hit you as hard as I can for as 
                        long as it takes...

                                 JOSEPH
                        Until Sitting Bull arrives.
           Miles flinches, then slowly sits back. BEAT.

                                 MILES
                        You’re willing to risk everything 
                        on that murderer? What makes you so 
                        sure he’ll come?

                                 JOSEPH
                        He enjoys killing white men.

           Miles stares at Joseph for a long, terrible moment. Then:

                                 MILES
                        Maybe you’re right. Maybe he’s on 
                        his way this very minute. But it’s 
                        still snowing. Your people are 
                        freezing. And starving. And dying. 
                        You’re all alone. And soon General 
                        Howard will be here and we’ll be 
                        twice the number we currently are. 
                        You might want to think about that 
                        before betting the lives of your 
                        people on a long shot.
                             (To nearby GUARD)
                        Get him out of here.

           Joseph slowly gets to his feet. The guard takes him by the 
           arm and leads him outside. Hold on Miles -- frustrated.

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - LATER

           Looking Glass walks over to Milan Tripp...

                                 LOOKING GLASS
                        Stand him up.

           Two WARRIORS lift Tripp to his feet. 

                                 LOOKING GLASS (CONT’D)
                        They won’t release Joseph until 
                        their man is free.
                             (Takes Tripp’s arm)
                        Let’s go.

           EXT. NO MAN’S LAND - LATER

           Joseph and Milan Tripp walk towards each other as they make 
           their way back to their respective camps. 

           They exchange a subtle glance as they pass each other...

           Joseph sees Ollokot’s body on the ground. He keeps walking...

           Each side anxiously waits for their man to reach safety.
           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           The Nez Perce surround Joseph, eager for news. Joseph glances 
           over at Looking Glass. BEAT.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Our only hope is that Sitting Bull 
                        gets to us in time.

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - LATER

           Miles stands beside Milan Tripp. Two TWELVE POUND CANONS are 
           placed next to the HOWITZER.

                                 SOLDIER
                             (To Miles)
                        Where are we aiming these, sir?

                                 MILES
                             (To Tripp)
                        Tell them.

           Milan Tripp nods and walks over...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - SAME TIME

           Joseph stands in the middle of the camp, looking around. 
           Terrible thoughts fill his head...

                                 JOSEPH
                             (To Nearby Warrior)
                        The soldier we captured...did he 
                        see the entire camp?

           The warrior nods. Joseph turns and stares out at the 
           Americans...He sees THREE CANNONS pointed their way...

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        No...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - SAME TIME

           Miles stares down at the Nez Perce camp. And then:

                                 MILES
                        Fire!

           ALL THREE CANONS FIRE AT ONCE!

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Joseph runs through the camp...
                                 JOSEPH
                        Get down! Get down! Get...

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A nightmare bombardment, killing men, 
           women, and children with every single volley...

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Soldiers watch the Nez Perce camp light up in the distance. 
           They can hear screams of dying women and children over the 
           canon’s roar. It’s an orgy of non-stop, unrelenting terror. 

           And as we pan across the somber faces of American soldiers, 
           we end on Miles. Even his eyes betray a hint of regret...

                                 MILES
                        Cease fire!

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Joseph holds on to Springtime for dear life. The smoke begins 
           to clear. Joseph opens his eyes...body parts lie all over the 
           ground. The camp is in ruin. 

           Joseph takes a deep breath, anticipating another volley of 
           hell to soon begin. But then...a strange, distant sound. 

           Galloping horse hooves! Far away, but approaching fast...

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           The Americans hear it, too. Everyone stops and turns...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           The thundering horses come closer. The ground begins to 
           shake. Any second, they’ll come pouring around the bluff...

           But whose horses are they? Sitting Bull’s or Howard’s?

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Warriors in rifle pits steady themselves...Looking Glass 
           stands, trying to get a better view...

           Behind him comes a distant FLASH followed by the crack of a 
           rifle...and then a bullet explodes into his head, ripping his 
           body out of FRAME...!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Milan Tripp slowly lowers a smoking rifle. BEAT.
           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           The galloping horses have built to a furious roar... 

           Joseph kneels beside Looking Glass’s corpse, in shock and 
           disbelief. And then, as if sensing the inevitable, he looks 
           out towards the distant bluffs just in time to see...

           General Howard’s cavalry charging around the bend.

           Six hundred riders surround the camp, joining Miles’ Army. 
           Joseph watches, stoically. He knows...it’s over.

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - LATER

           Howard dismounts. He stares at the distant Nez Perce camp, 
           then he sees the smoking canons. His eyes narrow. BEAT.

           INT. MILES’ TENT

           Miles pours himself a shot of WHISKEY. Howard sits at the 
           table with a cup of COFFEE. Just like before.

           Miles comes over and sits down. BEAT.

                                 MILES
                        Boy, am I glad to see you.

                                 HOWARD
                        Got here quick as we could.

                                 MILES
                        And not a moment too soon.

           Howard nods. BEAT.

                                 HOWARD
                        How long have you been pounding ‘em 
                        with those canons?

                                 MILES
                             (Hesitates)
                        Three days.

                                 HOWARD
                        Gonna keep it up much longer?

                                 MILES
                        As long as it takes.

                                 HOWARD
                        It’s mostly women and children in 
                        that camp, you know that?
                                 MILES
                        It’s war, Oliver. You know the 
                        costs better than anyone. And I 
                        don’t enjoy it anymore than you do. 
                        You fight to win. It’s that simple. 
                        There’s no middle ground in this 
                        sort of thing. It’s ugly. Always 
                        has been. And it brings out the 
                        worst...in everybody. Besides... 
                        I’ve got my men to think about. 
                        They’re freezing and Sitting Bull’s 
                        in the area.

                                 HOWARD
                        Is that the reason or the excuse?

                                 MILES
                        You’re out of line.

           Howard throws a letter on the table. BEAT.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 HOWARD
                        A wire from Agent Reynolds. Sitting 
                        Bull’s still in Canada. He doesn’t 
                        know what’s happening here.

                                 MILES
                        Good. That’s a relief.

           Howard stands and goes to leave.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        One thing, Oliver. My men have been 
                        through a lot this past week. If 
                        it’s alright with you, we’d like to 
                        see it through to the end.

           Howard looks at Miles for a moment and “gets it.” BEAT.

                                 HOWARD
                        They can surrender to you, Nelson. 
                        I won’t get in the way. If this 
                        doesn’t get you a general’s star, 
                        nothing will. I want to talk to 
                        him, though.

                                 MILES
                        Talk to who? Joseph? 

                                 HOWARD
                        That’s right. Alone.
           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           The American Army is now more than a THOUSAND SOLDIERS 
           strong. They stare down at the Nez Perce camp, waiting. 

           Howard makes his way to the front lines... 

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - SAME TIME

           Joseph holds Springtime close. She’s mumbling, hallucinating. 
           Distant shouts cause Joseph to look up... 

           General Howard is making his way through No Man’s Land. 
           Alone. With his single arm raised. Joseph gets to his feet...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           Joseph steps past the rifle pits and approaches Howard. The 
           two men stare at each other for a long time. Snow falls down 
           all around them in the open battlefield.

                                 HOWARD
                        Hello, Joseph.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (In English)
                        General Howard.

           Howard steps forward and observes the gray woolen shawl 
           Joseph is wearing, five bullet holes in the cloth. 

                                 HOWARD
                        You’ve had some close calls.
                             (Beat)
                        You have any idea how close to 
                        Canada you are? 

           Joseph manages a faint smile. BEAT.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        You wouldn’t have liked it, anyway. 
                        The winters are terrible.
                             (Beat)
                        It’s over. You know that, right?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Sitting Bull...

                                 HOWARD
                        He’s not coming, Joseph. He’s still 
                        in Canada. I’m sorry. You’re alone.

           Joseph says nothing. Howard’s words ring true.
                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        How’s your family? Are they alive?

           Joseph looks up, tears in his eyes...

                                 JOSEPH
                        My little girl...is out there 
                        somewhere. I don’t know where. My 
                        wife...does not have long.

                                 HOWARD
                        How many of your people are left? 
                        More than half?

           Joseph hesitates, then shakes his head.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Less?

           Joseph nods. Howard steps closer.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Joseph, listen to me. I know you 
                        must be thinking about a final 
                        stand. You are the Chief of the Nez 
                        Perce people. Your responsibility 
                        is to those who are alive. You 
                        think about that...and then you 
                        think about them. We can give you 
                        food and medicine. We can even 
                        search for your daughter. But you 
                        must surrender.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Can you help us go home?

           Howard looks at Joseph, knowing that’s a tall order.

                                 HOWARD
                        I’ll do what I can.

           Joseph stares at Howard through the falling snow, then turns 
           around and heads back towards the Nez Perce camp...

           EXT. NEZ PERCE CAMP - SAME TIME

           Joseph comes back into the camp. The remaining Nez Perce 
           surround him, anxious and afraid...

                                 NEZ PERCE WOMAN
                        Don’t let them take us away!

                                 NEZ PERCE MAN
                        Sitting Bull could still come!
           Joseph doesn’t seem to hear them. Up ahead, Springtime lies 
           still and peaceful. Joseph approaches and kneels beside her. 

           Her eyes are open, but vacant. She’s dead. Joseph stares at 
           her for an agonizing moment. 

           He stands and turns to face the remnants of his people...

                                 JOSEPH
                        You all have thoughts of Sitting 
                        Bull. But I can only think of my 
                        daughter. I don’t even know if 
                        she’s alive. I want to find 
                        her...maybe she is dead already.

           Joseph turns to face a YOUNG WARRIOR, standing nearby...

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Tell General Howard that I know his 
                        heart. And what he has said before, 
                        I have in my heart, also...

           Joseph looks around the camp, perhaps thinking of all the 
           people who are no longer there...

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs 
                        are killed. Looking Glass is dead. 
                        Toohoolhoolzote is dead. The old 
                        men are all dead...My brother, 
                        Ollokot, is dead. 

           Joseph glances down at Springtime’s body...he can’t bring 
           himself to say the words. Instead, he continues:

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        It is cold and we have no blankets. 
                        The little children are freezing to 
                        death...
                             (To the heavens)
                        Hear me, my Chiefs! I am tired! My 
                        heart is sick and sad... 
                             (Dramatic Beat)
                        From where the sun now stands, I 
                        will fight no more forever.

           Everyone absorbs Joseph’s speech. Nobody says a word.

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - LATER

           Howard and Miles pace back and forth near the front lines.

                                 SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Chief Joseph’s approaching!
           Howard and Miles rush out to meet him...

           EXT. BEAR PAW, MONTANA - MOMENTS LATER

           Joseph slowly rides up the hill and dismounts. With his head 
           bowed, Joseph offers his rifle to Howard. 

           Howard hesitates, then steps aside. 

           Miles comes forward and accepts the rifle. 

           Soldiers surround Joseph, guns raised, and take him away... 
           Howard and Miles watch Joseph disappear over the hill.

           They turn back and freeze. The surviving Nez Perce are now 
           approaching. Nearby soldiers watch -- horrified. 

           Women. Children. Elderly. Wounded and dying. These are the 
           people who have eluded the most powerful army on Earth?

           EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - LATER

           The Nez Perce are given food and medicine. 

           Soldiers watch the survivors with deep sympathy and sadness. 
           Some even play with the Nez Perce children.

           Joseph sits all alone, watching.

           INT. HOWARD’S TENT - LATER

           Howard sits quietly at his desk. Perry enters.

                                 PERRY
                        You asked to see me, sir?

                                 HOWARD
                        I need to send a wire. Would you 
                        mind taking this down?

           Perry takes out his note pad and stands ready. 

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        To General Sherman. Fugitive Nez 
                        Perce tribe apprehended. Chief 
                        Joseph surrendered...
                             (Dramatic Beat)
                        Norton Ranch murderers all dead. No 
                        need for further retribution.

           Perry finishes writing and looks up.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        How does that read?
                                 PERRY
                             (Shrugs)
                        Short. To the point. 

                                 HOWARD
                             (a moment, then)
                        It does not take many words to 
                        speak the truth.

           Perry nods, then leaves. Howard remains -- deep in thought. 

           INT. SHERMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           General Sherman enters and receives a THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE 
           from the crowded room. 

           Smiling ear to ear, he shakes hands and receives pats on the 
           back as he makes his way through the celebration...

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           The Nez Perce are escorted towards a waiting train -- the 
           Iron Monster -- puffs of smoke billowing into the sky...

           Nearby, Howard and Miles supervise on horseback.

           The tribe nears the station...HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, mostly 
           REPORTERS, are waiting for them...

                                 REPORTER
                        THERE THEY ARE!

           Everyone suddenly rushes forward and swarms the tribe. 

           Fathers lift children onto their shoulders so they can see 
           the most famous Indians in America. An absolute circus.

           The soldiers fight their way through the crowd, inching the 
           Indians closer to the train...

           As Joseph is about to board, he glances back at Howard. 

           The two men stare at each other for moment, much like they 
           did in the courtroom back in Wallowa. A lifetime ago. 

           Joseph climbs on the train and disappears from view...

           INT. TRAIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Joseph finds an empty row and sits by himself. 

           Oyema comes down the isle with her baby and sits nearby. 

           Joseph turns and sees her. BEAT.
           This subtle glance should say so much. Of all the Nez Perce 
           we have come to know, these are the only two who remain. 

           The rest are gone.

           Joseph turns and stares out the window, first at the massive 
           crowds, then north towards the distant mountains of Canada. 

           The train suddenly lurches forward and picks up speed... 

           EXT. MONTANA - THAT MOMENT

           The train glides down the endless track, carrying the Nez 
           Perce away into the fading beauty of the ruddy sunset. 

           The final car grows small in the distance, disappearing like 
           the Indian’s vanishing destiny...

                                                           SLOW FADE TO:

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - 1897

           Twenty years have passed and the world has changed. 

           America has industrialized and the frontier has been replaced 
           with cobblestone streets and bowler hats.

           EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - EVENING

           Thousands of people pour in to watch Buffalo Bill’s Wild West 
           Show, advertized prominently on the side of the building. 

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME TIME

           BUFFALO BILL (51) addresses the audience with a BULL HORN.

                                 BUFFALO BILL
                        Ladies and Gentlemen! For your 
                        entertainment this evening...it is 
                        my great pleasure to present to you 
                        a dramatization of one of the most 
                        exciting and thrilling chases in 
                        the history of the frontier...

           An OLD MAN sits in the audience. He has a thick grey beard 
           and sad, sunken eyes. And his right arm is missing.

                                 BUFFALO BILL (CONT’D)
                        ...they fought with the courage of 
                        ten thousand warriors and held our 
                        army at bay for several months. 
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you 
                        the historic flight of Chief Joseph 
                        and the Nez Perce!!!
           The crowd APPLAUDS as the show begins... 

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - LATER

           An ACTOR playing Chief Joseph delivers the immortal speech, 
           playing to the back row.

                                 CHIEF JOSEPH ACTOR
                        ...OUR CHIEFS ARE KILLED! LOOKING 
                        GLASS IS DEAD. TOOHOOLHOOLZOTE IS 
                        DEAD! MY BROTHER, OLLOKOT, HE IS 
                        DEAD! IT IS COLD AND THE LITTLE 
                        CHILDREN ARE FREEZING TO DEATH!

           He raises his arms towards an imaginary sun...

                                 CHIEF JOSEPH ACTOR (CONT’D)
                        FROM WHERE THE SUN NOW STANDS, I 
                        WILL FIGHT NO MORE FOREVER!

           The audience applauds. Howard watches sadly as the actors all 
           take a bow. And then, Buffalo Bill takes the stage. 

                                 BUFFALO BILL
                        Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
                             (Applause ends)
                        Thank you. And now, Ladies and 
                        Gentlemen, a very rare and special 
                        treat. With us tonight is a very 
                        honored guest. He was in town for 
                        President Grant’s funeral and he 
                        graciously accepted our invitation 
                        to be here, tonight. It’s my great 
                        pleasure to introduce you...to 
                        Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce!

           Howard’s face drops as a SPOTLIGHT finds Joseph in the 
           audience. Old and sad, Joseph stands and reluctantly waves. 

           Howard gets up and leaves...

           EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - LATER

           Joseph makes his way, unnoticed, through the giant crowds as 
           they pour out of the stadium and into the city...

           Howard comes outside. He sees Joseph walking away...

                                 HOWARD
                        Joseph! Joseph! Joseph...!

           Joseph keeps walking. He doesn’t seem to hear.

           Howard fights to get closer...
                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        Joseph! Joseph...!
                             (Beat)
                        HINMUUTU-YALATLAT!

           Joseph abruptly stops. He turns around. Howard approaches...

                                 JOSEPH
                             (In English)
                        General Howard.

                                 HOWARD
                        Joseph.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (Re: His name)
                        You pronounced it well.

                                 HOWARD
                        Thank you.

           Joseph hesitates, then nods towards Madison Square Garden.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Quite a show.

                                 HOWARD
                        Yes. It was...quite a show.

           The two men stand in deference to each other as the masses 
           shuffle past them without regard. BEAT.

                                 HOWARD (CONT’D)
                        I was wondering...if...
                             (Beat)
                        How’s your family? Did you ever 
                        find your daughter?

           Something stirs deep in Joseph’s eyes. He looks at Howard for 
           a long time...and then slowly shakes his head. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        No...they’re all gone.

           Howard is speechless. What can he say? Nothing.

           These two old men stand on the busy city street, their bodies 
           weary, their spirits broken. Once enemies, now remnants of a 
           distant era, forgotten and haunted.

           Knowing that the silence has somehow said all there is to 
           say, Joseph slowly turns and walks away. His sad, tired 
           figure grows small, absorbed by the modern world...
           The following words appear:

           Of the 800 Nez Perce who began the flight towards Canada, 
           fewer than 370 remained alive at Bear Paw. They had traveled 
           more than 1,300 miles and were less than 40 miles from the 
           Canadian border at the time of Joseph’s surrender. 

           They had eluded the army for 113 days, an accomplishment that 
           is still studied by generals at West Point, today.

           These words fade. Replaced by:

           The surviving Nez Perce spent the next eight years in 
           captivity on reservations in Kansas and Oklahoma, where more 
           than 100 perished from disease and starvation.

           These words fade. Replaced by:

           In 1885, under intense pressure from the public, including 
           the written support of General Howard and Colonel Miles, the 
           American Government granted the remaining Nez Perce 
           permission to settle in Washington state.

           These words fade. Replaced by:

           Despite soaring fame and widespread popularity, Joseph was 
           never allowed to return home to the Wallowa Valley. He 
           continued to lobby the American government unsuccessfully for 
           the remainder of his life.

           These words fade. Replaced by:

           Chief Joseph passed away in 1904 at the age of 64. Survived 
           by no one, it is said that he died of a broken heart.

           And as these words fade, we find Howard staring into the 
           crowd. Thousands of people pour down the street...

           But Joseph is gone.

                                          THE END
