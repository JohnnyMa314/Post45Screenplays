                                   “Sidney Grimes”

           FADE IN:

           INT. HALLWAY - FEDERAL PENITENTIARY - VICTORVILLE - DAY 

           Looking through a STEEL BAR DOOR.  Pitted, punitive.  As 
           CREDITS roll: Columbia Pictures Presents:

           The SHAPES of TWO MEN (full out of focus) coming toward us.  
           The one in the lead is wearing all khaki.  He’s a few steps 
           ahead of the other who’s in blue. 

           Stepping into focus as he stops at the bars: SIDNEY GRIMES.  
           His face gives nothing away.  Not a goddamn thing.

                                 GUARD (BLUE)
                        Man on discharge!

           A beat before the steel bar door BUZZES open and Grimes is 
           passed from the first guard to a second.  

           PROCESSING COUNTER

           A THIRD GUARD looks across at Grimes.

                                 THIRD GUARD
                        Last name.

                                 GRIMES
                        Grimes.

                                 THIRD GUARD
                        First name.

                                 GRIMES
                        Sidney.

           The third guard pulls a FINGERPRINT CARD marked: Grimes, S.  
           The Guard sets Grimes’ thumb over a small print scanner.  As 
           a light flashes across...

           SIDNEY GRIMES

           Across another counter.  Changed now into civilian pants and 
           shirt.  He takes two small manila envelopes from a tray, 
           opens one, shakes a gold WEDDING BAND into his palm.  He 
           matter-of-factly slips it on his ring finger, then opens the 
           other.  It holds a SMALLER WEDDING BAND on a thin GOLD CHAIN.  

           As he slips the chain over his head...  

           A GREYHOUND BUS TICKET

           Is set on the counter.  One way Victorville to Los Angeles.  
                                 FOURTH GUARD’S VOICE
                        One bus ticket to inmate’s place of 
                        conviction.  Eleven dollars gate 
                        money for lunch.

           A $10 and a $1 are placed on top of the bus ticket.  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. RELEASE DOOR - FEDERAL PRISON - VICTORVILLE - DAY 

           A stark door in a monolith of concrete.  It opens and Sidney 
           Grimes steps into the sunlight.  Stands there like Lazarus.  

           A second INMATE follows.  Young, skinny, Chicano - LUNA - In 
           his Pendleton shirt and khaki pants, it’s his lucky day, too.  
           They walk toward a waiting Federal Department of Prisons VAN.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. PRISON VAN - POWERLINE ROAD - DAY (ROLLING)

           Passing enormous electrical towers.  Luna watches over his 
           shoulder, happy to see the prison get smaller behind them.

                                 LUNA
                        Fuck.  You.

           He smiles over at Sidney.  Grimes does not interact.

                                 LUNA (CONT’D)
                        How long were you down?

           Grimes doesn’t answer.  Luna slides on some sunglasses.

                                 LUNA (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, man, what is it?  Top secret 
                        or something?

           But Grimes doesn’t feel like talking.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - VICTORVILLE - DAY

           Train tracks, a river and a dozen of BUSES.  In case you’re 
           not getting the hint, those are at least three ways out of 
           town.  The 4th is a BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR idling there.

           The DRIVER switches off the TALK RADIO, leans forward as...

           The prison van arrives, lets off Luna and Grimes.  No ‘bon 
           voyage’ from the guards as they pull away.
                                 LUNA
                               (watching them go)
                        Fuck.  You.  Too.

           Grimes is already walking toward a bus.  Just a hitch in his 
           groove as he sees the Driver standing outside the town car 
           holding up a card across which is written: Grimes.

           The Driver glances at the back of the card.  A fax of a photo 
           of Grimes is paper clipped there.  Sidney ten years ago.

                                 DRIVER
                        Mr. Grimes?

           Grimes’ answer rests in the mere fact he stops.  Luna 
           bringing up the rear.

                                 DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        I’m here to drive you.

                                 GRIMES
                        Yeah?

                                 DRIVER
                        Wherever you want to go.  It’s 
                        courtesy of...
                               (checks back of card)
                        ...Of Mr. Roman Cahill.

                                 GRIMES
                               (resumes past him)
                        Tell Roman thanks, but I already 
                        have a bus ticket.  

                                 DRIVER
                               (calls after him)
                        Seriously?

           Grimes holds up the bus ticket as he makes for a bus.

                                 GRIMES
                        I earned it.

           The Driver watches after him.  Luna slides alongside.

                                 LUNA
                        So long as it’s a free ride, man, 
                        I’ll take it.  One of my girls was 
                        supposed to be here, but, I think 
                        Mapquest fucked her, you know?

           The Driver gives Luna a brief ‘drop dead’ look, gets back in 
           the town car.  As the locks click down.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

           Grimes sits.  Takes up two empty seats.  Luna follows, takes 
           up the two empty seat across the aisle and one row up.  He 
           looks back over his shoulder, trying to figure Grimes out.  
           Good luck.  And as the air brakes WHOOSH...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. SHOTS OF THE BUS - FREEWAY - DAY

           Various rolling shots as the opening credits finish up with: 
           Written & Directed by Brian Helgeland...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Inside the bus Grimes stares ahead.  Introspective with a 
           vengeance.  Luna is looking out the windows, head on a 
           swivel, finally sees some scenery he recognizes.

                                 LUNA
                        Fucking Boyle Heights, man.
                               (to Grimes)
                        Home, huh?

                                 GRIMES
                        I’m from Oxnard.

                                 LUNA
                               (grins)
                        You know what I mean, ese.

           As they roll through the pretzel of the 5, 10 & 110 
           INTERCHANGES, Luna getting nervous.

                                 LUNA (CONT’D)
                        I did my time in prison well.  Got 
                        my G-E-D, huh?  No one in my family 
                        ever got their G-E-D before.

           Downtown rises around it as the bus angles off onto the 7th 
           Street off-ramp...  Luna really nervous now.

                                 LUNA (CONT’D)
                        You got someone waiting?
                               (no answer)
                        Is that top secret, too?  That’s 
                        cool; I don’t know if I do either.
                               (looks ahead)
                        But I’m hoping.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           EXT. GREYHOUND STATION - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

           The bus stops.  People get off.  Luna gets off, looks around -
           - There!  His ruka.  PENELOPE.  She almost knocks him over as 
           she jumps in his arms.  As Luna holds on, tries not to cry...

           Grimes gets off.  He considers Luna for a wistful beat before 
           continuing on his solitary way.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. FAIR PARK AVENUE - EAGLE ROCK - DAY

           Late afternoon sun streams down the street.  A hybrid SUV 
           pulls up the driveway of a sweet little CRAFTSMAN HOUSE.  A 
           YOUNG MOM & DAD get out.  The mom retrieves the Huggies while 
           the dad unstraps an 18-MONTH OLD from its car seat.

                                 DAD
                               (concentrating)
                        Jeez, Houdini couldn’t get out of 
                        this thing...

           But the young mom has lost track of what’s going on.  Because 
           she’s seen THE MAN standing out on the sidewalk.

           Of course, it’s Sidney Grimes.  He stares up at the house -- 
           through it almost.  Unaware of the family in the driveway.

                                 YOUNG MOM
                        Hon...

           The dad follows her gaze over to Grimes.  Seems a little 
           weird.  Dad hands the baby off to mom and steps over.

                                 DAD
                        Can I help you?
                               (Sidney looks over)
                        Are you okay?

                                 GRIMES
                        Yeah, sorry, I used to live here.

           As the dad relaxes at this...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. CRAFTSMEN LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - DAY

           The front door lock clicking open.  The young mom and dad 
           leading Sidney inside.  Gracious hosts.

                                 DAD
                        We bought it six months ago.  From 
                        the Stoville’s.  Did they buy it 
                        from you?
                                 GRIMES
                        Ten years ago.

                                 DAD
                        They were nice people.

                                 GRIMES
                        I never met them.

           Sidney looks down to where a handrail comes down off stairs 
           going up.  There’s a STAINED GLASS detail between the rails.

                                 MOM
                        I love that glass.  Do you know the 
                        story behind it?  

                                 GRIMES
                        It was a present.  For my wife.

                                 MOM
                        You should have brought her with.

                                 GRIMES
                        She --  She’s not alive.

           He attempts a smile to let her know it’s okay, but it’s 
           really to cover something raw digging its way up.  He looks 
           back to the glass.  The mom and dad exchange a look.

                                 MOM
                        Can I get you something to drink?

                                 GRIMES 
                        Just a glass of water.  Thanks.

           Happy to do it, mom heads off with the baby.  It looks back 
           over its mom’s shoulder at Sidney as it goes.

           A flood of memories pummel Grimes.  Looking about he takes a 
           step back, steps on a SQUEAK toy.  The dad grins.

                                 DAD
                        It’s like land mines in here.  You 
                        got kids?

           For just a second Grimes looks like he might cry.  Then 
           something grim and determined takes it’s place and... 

           Grimes heads up the stairs.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        Um, uhh, hey --
           CRAFTSMAN 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY

           A man on a mission, knows exactly where he’s going, Grimes 
           reaches up, pulls on a CORD which brings down a folding set 
           of ATTIC STAIRS.   BANG as the end hits the floor!

           CRAFTSMAN ATTIC SPACE

           Grimes crosses, stops at the CHIMNEY.  Pressing his cheek to 
           the bricks, he reaches around into the tight space behind.  
           It takes a moment to find what he’s looking for, and then --

           He pulls out something wrapped in an OILY RAG.  Unfolds it to 
           reveal a heavy looking 9MM.  As he stuffs it into his belt...

           2ND FLOOR HALLWAY

           The dad gets out of the way as Grimes comes pounding down the 
           stairs, continues past him. 

           CRAFTSMAN

           Grimes exits.  And then the dad is at the door watching him 
           go.  The mom.  Relieved to see the tiger leave their house.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. UPSCALE STREET - ENCINO - TWILIGHT

           An adults only party underway.  Two VALETS parking cars.  
           ‘Oldies’ thump down from the house and get out of the cars.

           Standing in the shadows of the foliage across the street -- 
           watching -- Sidney Grimes.  As he sinks back out of sight...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. CHILDRESS BACKYARD - ENCINO - TWILIGHT

           RAY CHILDRESS at his barbecue.  People mingling by the pool 
           beyond.  An expansive patio can barely contain the six 
           burner/pizza oven/sink/wood and gas barbecue with outdoor TV.  
           Must’ve cost 40 grand.  Childress checks on the tri-tip.

           The chicken’s going, steaks are on deck and you’d have to 
           look close to see what a tough sonuvabitch RAY CHILDRESS 
           really is...  He looks up as MRS. CHILDRESS steps over.  As 
           tough in her own way as he is.

                                 MRS. CHILDRESS
                        I’m looking for an E-T-A.

                                 CHILDRESS
                        You can’t rush a tri-tip, honey.
                                 MRS. CHILDRESS
                        Not on the food; on you.  Let 
                        Carlos finish up here.

                                 CHILDRESS
                        Okay, okay, send him down.

           He grabs tongs, starts flipping chicken.  As she goes...

                                 MRS. CHILDRESS 
                        Don’t burn them.

                                 CHILDRESS
                        I burn them I ruin the party; when 
                        was the last time I ruined a party?

           And she’s gone.  Bachman-Turner-Overdrive coming out of the 
           rock speakers around the pool.  Childress singing along.

                                 CHILDRESS/BTO
                        You ain't seen nothin' yet. B-Baby, 
                        you just ain't seen nothin' yet.  

           He’s unaware of the man stepping forward from the gloom of 
           the far backyard.  He must’ve come over the wall.  Sidney 
           Grimes: the 9mm gripped firmly in his right hand.

           Childress finally clocks him.  An ‘oh fuck’ moment if there 
           ever was one.  It’s obvious Childress knows exactly who he’s 
           looking at and so does Grimes.  Finally...

                                 CHILDRESS
                        When did you get out?

                                 GRIMES
                        This morning.

           Grimes raises the 9mm.  Childress is more mad than anything.

                                 CHILDRESS
                        Didn’t think you’d come so quick.

           Childress glances to the grill counter.  Tucked among the 
           barbecue tools: a REVOLVER.  He must’ve thought something.  

                                 CHILDRESS (CONT’D)
                        I had a goddamn good life.

           As Childress drops the tongs, goes for the gun.  BOOM, BOOM!  

           ANGLE FROM ACROSS THE YARD

           Childress sprawled dead.  Grimes walks back the way he came.  
           The peripheral party sounds glitch, people not sure what they 
           just heard.  And as Sidney walks past camera and disappears 
           into the dark, the speakers still blast....

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. BEAT-UP SEDAN - NORTH HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT (ROLLING)

           Slouched in the front passenger seat, phone pressed to his 
           ear: ROMAN CAHILL.  Roman is hard, sly and brave.  

                                 ROMAN
                               (into phone)
                        Yeah that’s right.  This is Cahill.
                               (a beat)
                        What?  What do you mean he got on 
                        the bus?

           Driving is DOCKERY.  HARDWICK is in back staring out the 
           window.  METCALF beside him.  They look sledgehammer tough.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                               (another beat)
                        That’s what he said?
                               (last beat)
                        Yeah of course I know I still gotta 
                        pay for the fucking car...  Yeah 
                        thanks for nothing.

           He clicks off, grins to himself, talks to himself.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        He earned it...  Classic Grimes.

                                 DOCKERY
                        Roman, they’re stopping.  Pizza 
                        Hut.

           Through the windshield: a BLUE HONDA ACCORD pulls into the 
           parking lot.  Roman eyeballing it.  We are in the midst of a 
           rolling surveillance that just stopped rolling.

           Roman watches as (after parking nose out) JUNKIES DAVE and 
           STEVE get pumped inside the Accord. Dave alternately striking 
           himself in the chest, bopping Steve on the shoulder.

           Dockery looks over as a SECOND BEAT-UP SEDAN pulls up across 
           the street, exchanges looks and nods with more SLEDGE HAMMER 
           MEN sitting inside.  

           Roman looks back at Hardwick who’s lost in thought.

                                 ROMAN
                        Earth to Hardwick.  Wake up!

           As Hardwick snaps out of it, Steve and Dave exit the Accord.
                                 DOCKERY
                        The engine’s still running.

           Steve and Dave pull up BANDANAS as they ENTER THE PIZZA HUT.  
           Roman is quite serious all of a sudden.

                                 ROMAN
                        Take ‘em on the way out.

           Roman pulls a POLICE BADGE out from under his shirt, lets it 
           hang from its chain across his chest as he exits the sedan.

           STREET

           MOVE WITH Roman who hand-signals the cops in the other sedan 
           as he crosses the street.  As he looks ahead he has a view 
           through the storefront through which he sees: one of the 
           masked junkies PISTOL-WHIPS the COUNTERMAN.

           Junkies Dave and Steve bang out the front door.  As they 
           appear, the second unmarked sedan squeals forward from the 
           corner through the intersection.

           Dave and Steve dive into the Accord, lurch forward only to 
           find the exit blocked by the skidding sedan.

           ACCORD

           Smoke pours off the wheels as Steve throws it in reverse.  
           They don’t even see Dockery jump the first sedan over the 
           curb as it crosses the sidewalk into the lot and -- The 
           Accord rear ends it, T-bones it on the driver’s side.

           Junkie Dave stands out the sunroof and lets loose with a gun 
           in each hand BLASTING AWAY as...

           STREET

           RETURN FIRE comes from two different directions.

           The Accord’s rear bumper pinwheels loose and away as Steve 
           fishtails the Accord free of the sedan.  Dave is still up out 
           of the sunroof turret firing away.

           The Accord swings toward the freedom that is Vanowen ahead.  
           Steve blinks his eyes at...

           ROMAN

           Waiting calmly in the street, holding his left hand out to 
           stop traffic even as he raises his right gun hand.  

           Steve bears down on Roman as Roman fires on Dave.  Dave 
           firing back.
           STREET

           Dockery leans out from the sedan window, unloading.  L-A-P-D 
           across the back of his windbreaker.

           The Accord’s side windows blowing out: Steve taking glass in 
           the side of the head, jerking the wheel even as --

           Roman hits sunroof Dave roughly in the color bone.

           The Accord slams into the back of a CONCRETE BUS BENCH and 
           Dave is launched -- Hits the street at Roman’s feet.  

           As Roman rolls Dave over, cuffs his hands behind his back...

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                               (pissed; muttering)
                        We all discharged.  You know what 
                        that means?  It means I have to get 
                        a supervisor down here.  

           Beyond the others are pulling Steve from the Accord.  As Dave 
           becomes aware that the BLOOD pumping out onto the street just 
           in front of him is his own.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        It means we all have to fill out 
                        discharge incident reports.  

                                 JUNKIE DAVE
                        I don’t want to die, man!

           Roman rolls him back over, reaches in, looks for the artery.

                                 ROMAN
                        Fuck no.  You know how many reports 
                        that is?  

           Roman presses down on Dave’s errant artery with his thumb, 
           immediately stops the flow of blood.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re not gonna die, asshole.  

           Roman gives Dave a very meaningful nose-to-nose look.

           INT. AISLE 6 - THE DO-IT CENTER - SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT

           Grimes stands staring at a shelf of GARDEN HOSES.  He pulls 
           one out, then casts a sidelong look up and down the aisle.  
           No one here but him.  Grimes pulls out the rag-wrapped gun he 
           shot Childress with and shoves it deep into the back of the 
           shelf.  Then replaces the coil of hose.  As good a place as 
           any to hide a murder weapon.  As he starts down the aisle...

           CLOSE ON MECHANICS SOAP

           The lid is popped off a tin.  Fingers scoop a handful of the 
           thick goop.  We’re now in...

           AISLE EIGHT

           Grimes rubs the soap between his hands as he walks.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           LISA BELL

           In a RITZ-CARLTON HOTEL ROOM.  Downtown LA can be seen out 
           the 30th floor window, but if you’re looking at that there is 
           something wrong with you.  

           Seen from behind, sweat glistening on her back, Bell is on 
           top and serious about what she’s doing.  The MAN on the 
           bottom reaches back for the headboard as he grunts in 
           pleasure.  He kinda can’t believe his eyes as she looms over 
           him.  And her Blackberry BUZZES like a sonuvabitch.

           It stops.  Starts again.  On the night stand. She finally 
           glances over, spots the name: FOWLER.

                                 BELL
                        Shit...

           As she leans forward to get it, he comes out of her.

                        him, walked back out.

           The man watches from bed, forgotten as Bell pulls on her 
           skirt, tucks in her blouse.  LA glitters beyond.

                                 BELL
                        Sorry, work emergency.

           This sits a beat as he realizes something.

                        I don’t even, what do you do?

                        Hey, um, will I see you again?

           She looks back from the half-open door.  A wistful beat.  She 
           finally just shakes her head.  As the door clicks shut...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           A run-down shit place.  Grimes checks the address, heads in. 
           INT. LOBBY - ECHO PARK HALFWAY HOUSE - NIGHT

           There’s a front desk.  A SLOGAN on the wall: Responsibility 
           Begins With You.  The NIGHTMAN looks up as Grimes steps over.

                                 NIGHTMAN
                        Can I help you?

                                 GRIMES
                        I’m assigned here.  Name is Grimes.  

           The nightman reacts, looks past him.  Grimes looks over his 
           shoulder, sees a plainclothed DETECTIVE and a UNIFORMED COP 
           standing from chairs against the wall.

                                 DETECTIVE PHELPS
                        LAPD, Mr. Grimes.  Detective 
                        Phelps.  You want to tell me where 
                        you’ve been the last few hours?

           Grimes stares at him a beat, memorizing his face.

                                 GRIMES
                        Walking.

                        Walking where?

           Another guy steps over from a different angle.  SAFARIS.

                                 SAFARIS
                        Lou Safaris, your parole officer.  
                        This is not how you wanted your 
                        first day free to go.

           Grimes looks from Safaris back to the Phelps.

                                 GRIMES
                        Just walking.

           Safaris makes a spinning gesture with his finger: “turn 
           around.”  Grimes just stares at him.

                                 SAFARIS
                        Case you missed the memo, a parolee

                        rights is a condition of parole.  

           Grimes turns, sets his hands on the front desk, stares 
           straight through the nightman as Safaris pats him down.

                                 DETECTIVE PHELPS
                        You shoot anyone tonight, Sidney?

           No answer.  No gun either from the pat down.

           Grimes holds them up as Phelps runs a swab around the web of 
           Grimes’ thumb across his palm, the back of his hand.  Done, 
           he places the swab in a plastic bag the uniformed cop holds.

                                 SAFARIS
                        You fired a gun, we’re gonna know 
                        it, you dumb mutherfucker.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. RAMPART STATION HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Fowler talking to a uniformed COP, turning to Bell as she 
           comes down the hall to join him.

                                 FOWLER
                        They’re down in three.  Brought the 
                        guy in five minutes ago.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM THREE - NIGHT

           Where half a dozen COPS watch through the one way glass into 
           the INTERROGATION ROOM where Grimes is shackled to a steel 
           chair.  Detective Phelps hangs back as a BULLET-HEADED 
           DETECTIVE sits across from Grimes.  

                                 BULLET-HEAD
                               (over speakers)
                        Did you kill Ray Childress?  

           RAMPART INTERROGATION ROOM

                                 BULLET-HEAD (CONT’D)
                        Did you kill the cop who put your 
                        sorry ass in prison?  You walk in 
                        his backyard put a bullet in him?  
                               (a beat)
                        So far you’re not saying no.

           Grimes doesn’t say a word, doesn’t acknowledge the guy.  
           Bullet-head gets right in his face.

                                 BULLET-HEAD (CONT’D)
                        Childress was a friend to a lot of 
                        cops around here.  He did good and 
                        he made good.  He was where a lot 
                        of us hoped to end up one day.  

                                 GRIMES
                        Where’s that?  Dead?
           Furious, Bullet-head flashes a vicious look to Phelps.  
           Catching the drift, Phelps steps in front of the room’s 
           monitor camera.  As he covers it --

           Bullet-head wings a vicious shot into Grimes’ side.  Grimes 
           sucks wind, but Bull-head also hurts his hand.  As he tries 
           to shake the pain away...

           OBSERVATION ROOM

           A wide attitude berth is given as Bell and Fowler arrive.  A 
           SURLY COP mouthing ‘I-A’ to a YOUNGER COP.   Another cop 
           ‘toggles’ the speaker switch back and forth to warn the cops 
           in the interrogation room. 

                                 FOWLER
                               (recognizes him)
                        I’ll be.  Sidney-goddamn-Grimes.

           Bell looks to Fowler, obviously doesn’t know who Grimes is.

                               (low)
                        Scumbag ex-cop.  Before your time.  
                        I’ll fill you in after.

                               (over speaker)
                        Where’d you dump the gun, Grimes?

           No answer from Grimes.  Fowler addresses the room.

                                 FOWLER
                        When did he get out?

                                 SURLY COP
                        This morning.  Victorville.

                                 FOWLER
                        What do they got so far?

                                 SURLY COP
                        No alibi, no murder weapon.  But he 
                        aced the ferrozine test.

           INTERROGATION ROOM

           Bullet-Head still rubbing his hand.

                                 GRIMES
                        Hit with your palm, not your fist.  
                        You won’t hurt your hand that way.

                                 DETECTIVE PHELPS
                        I get it, Grimes.  You come out a 
                        prison all the way on, is that it?

           No answer.  Phelps leans in, tries to catch Grimes’ eye.

                                 DETECTIVE PHELPS (CONT’D)
                        Am I annoying you?

                                 GRIMES
                        No, just hope it’s not contagious.

                                 DETECTIVE PHELPS
                        What’s that?

                                 GRIMES
                        How goddamn stupid you are.

           OBSERVATION ROOM

           Bell tries not to smile.  And as Grimes looks past Bullet-
           Head at the one way glass, he seems to look right at her.

                                 GRIMES (CONT’D)

                        next question you got, ask it with 
                        a lawyer in the room.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. RAMPART STATION - 6TH STREET - NIGHT 

           The front doors open and Grimes exits.  A free man.  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. CAFETERIA - RAMPART STATION - NIGHT

           Bell and Fowler sit across from each other.  Bell with 
           coffee, Fowler eating Boston Creme Pie.

                                 FOWLER
                        I was on the team that arrested 
                        Grimes.  2001.  We got a tip he had 
                        drugs and cash in his garage.  We 
                        found about fifty grand worth of 
                        heroin inside a spare tire.  Forty 
                        in cash in a toolbox.

                                 BELL
                        Should have pled home improvement. 
                        Was he working narcotics?

           Fowler smiles over a forkful of pie.
                                 FOWLER
                        Not only was he working narcotics, 
                        he was in Ray Childress’ narcotics 
                        crew.  Grimes was a young cop doing 
                        buy busts.  Junior man.  He said 
                        Childress set him up.  The judge 
                        did not agree.

                                 BELL
                        What did you think?  

                                 FOWLER
                        There were rumors about Childress 
                        even back then, but Grimes was two 
                        months behind on his mortgage plus 
                        a dealer IDed him as a guy who’d 
                        broke in and hijacked him.  Took 
                        his dope and the cash and split.

           He eats another forkful, muses as he chews.

                                 FOWLER (CONT’D)
                        Anyhow, it didn’t matter.  Deep 
                        into the trial.  Just before it was 
                        going to the jury, Grimes changes 
                        his plea to guilty.  He confessed.

                                 BELL
                        He make a deal with the DA?

                                 FOWLER
                        If he did it was a shit one.  He 
                        still got ten years which is what 
                        he would’ve got off a jury guilty.

                                 BELL
                        So he serves, steps out into the 
                        free world and goes gunning 
                        straight for Childress.  Jesus.  

                                 FOWLER
                        Jesus got nothing to do with it.

           Bell thinks it over.  Fowler eats.  They both look over as 
           Detective Phelps enters with Roman on his heels.  Roman 
           questioning him, Phelps answering, but annoyed.

                                 BELL
                        Maybe Roman’s trying to confess.  

                                 FOWLER
                        Grimes and Roman graduated the 
                        academy together.  Best friends 
                        back in the day.  

           Bell processes this information.
                                 BELL
                        Let’s see, 2001.  Roman was in Vice 
                        busting prostitutes then.

                                 FOWLER
                        When he wasn’t dating them.  

           They watch as Phelps shrugs, hasn’t got the answer Roman 
           wants.  Phelps heads off with his coffee.

                                 BELL
                        Roman’s old buddy kills his current 
                        enemy.  Interesting.

           CAFETERIA LINE

           Jello.  Pie.  Old school except for the yogurt.  As Roman 
           considers his choices, Bell steps up alongside him.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        Got a question for you.

           Roman pushes his tray down the rail.  Bell follows.

                                 ROMAN
                        Internal Affairs has to fill out a

                                 BELL
                        It’s off the record.  You think 
                        Sidney Grimes killed Ray Childress?

                                 ROMAN
                        I have no idea.

                                 BELL
                        You think he killed Childress on 
                        your behalf or his own?  Or was it 
                        a two birds one stone thing?

           Roman looks over the sandwiches, tries to find the best one.

                        squeezed you a little too hard, 
                        that you panicked...
                                 ROMAN
                        Squeeze me a little too hard,

           She watches as he walks away.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           SIDNEY GRIMES

           Does push-ups.  Stripped to his boxers.  These are not ‘get-
           in-shape-time-to-tone-up’ jobs.  These are righteous prison 
           push-ups.  These are hate-the-world push ups.  These are 
           survival push-ups.  This is the mortification of self.  We 
           are in a for shit 8x10 room.  A bed, a dresser and a window.  

           Bleeding incongruously over it, an operatic SOPRANO singing a 
           song which will haunt the rest of the film.  We hear it in 
           bits and burst, distorted and with sudden clarity: “O mio 
           babbino caro, Mi piace, è bello è bello, Vo’andare in Porta 
           Rossa a comperar l'anello!”  Emotional, strange.

           Grimes’ arms pump; his back glistens with sweat.   We see a 
           dozen small ROUND SCARS along his back ribs where a prison 
           screwdriver once stitched its magic.  Mixed with the music 
           now: a VOICE.  Soft, intimate:

                                 CARLY’S VOICE
                        I adore you, Mr. Blue.  It’s always 
                        good to see someone so beautiful.  

           At his breaking point, the last few push-ups are borne from 
           rage. Despair.  Done, Grimes rolls to one hip, catches his 
           breath.  He is one hard looking motherfucker.

           Standing, he surveys his domain.  He steps over, examines the 
           flimsy lock on the door.  You could just about pop it by 
           pulling on the knob.

           Grimes pushes his bed across the floor, doesn’t stop till the 
           foot of the bed is jammed right up against the door.  
           Satisfied, he turns off the light, climbs into bed.  He 
           stares at the ceiling, listening to the late night traffic.  

           And as we get inside his head...

                                 CARLY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                               (laughs softly)
                        If I surrounded you, would you 
                        surrender?  Would you give yourself 
                        to me absolutely?  
           And we’re aware that someone is in bed alongside him.  Not 
           for real, but in his head.  We feel her more than see her.  
           Grimes never looks over, though we occasionally see an elbow, 
           a hand, feel the pressure on the mattress, hear the voice.

                                 CARLY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                               (laughs softly)
                        Remember Baja?  I thought I looked 
                        so pretty when we were there.  
                        Forever ago.  You know everything’s 
                        gonna be okay, don’t you?  Even 
                        though I’ll never look like that 
                        girl again.  Okay I’ll stop.  Even 
                        though talking to you is as close 
                        as I can get without touching you.  
                        Hey, Mr. Blue.  You think someone’s 
                        blood stays alive even when their 
                        heart stops pumping it?  I do.

           Finally, as Grimes pulls his pillow up around his ears.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. HARBOR VIEW CEMETERY - EARLY MORNING

           An odd mixture of bird’s singing and the low boom of ship’s 
           unloading in San Pedro Harbor below.  A CARETAKER comes out 
           of his SHACK, points Grimes off in a direction.

           GRIMES

           Walks through the cemetery, past endless headstones, at home 
           among the dead.  Toward the end of his journey, he hesitates.

           Ahead, a MAN stands before a grave, his back to Grimes.  It 
           seems to be his destination.  The man turns at Grimes’ 
           footsteps on the gravel path.  It’s Roman.

                                 ROMAN
                        Hey, man...

           Roman steps over, hugs him.  It’s an awkward moment, but a 
           moment nonetheless.  As it ends...

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        How the fuck are you, Sidney?

                                 GRIMES
                        Glad to be out, Rome.

           Roman nods, considers this, considers where they are.

                                 ROMAN
                        Yeah.  Tell that to Childress, huh?

           Grimes doesn’t answer.  Instead, asks:
                                 GRIMES
                        How’d you know I’d be here?

                                 ROMAN
                        I didn’t.  It’s Thursday.  
                               (shrugs)
                        I come here every Thursday.  Try to 
                        at least.  

           Roman gestures to a headstone.  Grimes looks.  Carly Grimes.  
           Born in 1973 and died in 2001.  Ten years ago.  Grimes’ heart 
           catches in his throat.  Roman gives him a moment, then:

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        I came to see you a few times.  
                        Always the same.  Visit refused.

                                 GRIMES
                        Didn’t feel like seeing anyone.

                                 ROMAN
                        For ten years?

           Grimes just doesn’t answer, looks down at the stone.  So does 
           Roman.  Something weirdly dangerous about it as we feel Roman 
           being very physically aware of Grimes.

                                 GRIMES
                        You still a cop?

                                 ROMAN
                        What else?  SIS working out of the 
                        77th.  I follow armed robbers 
                        around all day.

                                 GRIMES
                        You shoot ‘em on the way out?

                                 ROMAN
                        We call it a hot take down, but 
                        something like that.
                               (starts laughing)
                        My demons are running the show, 
                        man.  I’m just along for the ride.  

           Grimes looks back at him.  An uncomfortable beat.  

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Remember when we used to roll

                               (no answer)
                        Gotta confess, I used to try to get 
                        to your place early while you were 
                        still asleep.  Just to talk to her 
                        alone for five minutes.  Then she’d 
                        bring you your coffee and... “

                        Then she’d make me swear to look 
                        after you.  God, she was something.

           Grimes doesn’t answer, but the words are not lost on him.

                                 GRIMES
                        I hadn’t figured on being there.  

                                 ROMAN
                        Well, you’re gonna be.  So you 
                        better start thinking about it.
                               (shrugs)
                        Anything I can do, you got it.

                                 GRIMES
                        No offense, Roman, but you can 
                        leave me here in peace.

           Roman nods, absolutely gets it.

                                 ROMAN
                        You want me to -- I can wait up 
                        there -- Give you a ride back?  You 
                        got a bus ticket out of here, too?

           Roman smiles. A little of that rawness seeping out of Sidney.

                                 GRIMES
                        Take off, huh?

                                 ROMAN

                        mean, Christ.

           Roman takes a few steps backwards.  As he turns to go...

                                 GRIMES
                        Hey...

                        end.  Thank you.

           Roman waves it off.  Takes a beat to soak the tableaux in.

                                 ROMAN
                        Redemption’s out there somewhere,

                        where I can get some.

           As he goes, we stay with Grimes.  Jericho’s walls fall.  
           Grimes steps up, sinks to his knees before the stone.  Her 
           name now at his eye level.  Carly.  Grimes whispers:

                                 GRIMES
                        I’m here, baby. Tell me what to do.

           ROMAN

           Walking away.  Putting space between them.  He casually 
           reaches into his belt under his jacket, pulls out a cocked 
           BERETTA.  Easing the hammer back down, he returns it to his 
           shoulder holster.  A few more steps and he stops, looks back.  

           Sees his old friend Sidney Grimes.  On his knees.  His head 
           resting on the cool marble of his wife’s tombstone.  Hard to 
           say what Roman’s thinking as he turns, continues on his way. 

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. NURSING HOME - CULVER CITY - DAY

           Bell parks her car outside a NURSING HOME.  She gets out, 
           heads for the entrance, passing several OLD MEN who sit 
           watching traffic go by from a little sitting area. 

                                 OCTOGENARIAN
                        You can’t park in a red zone, young

                                 BELL
                        I’m a police officer, sir.

                        You got an ID?

           Humoring him, Bell digs out her badge, holds it up.

                        It’s a badge.  It’s understood.  
           He checks her out as she enters, looks back to his boys.

                                 OCTOGENARIAN
                        That’s a policeman?

           INT. PATIENT ROOM - NURSING HOME - CULVER CITY - DAY

           Bell sits in a chair looking at her father, who’s in bed 
           singing to himself.  FRANK BELL is handsome, 62, and 
           suffering from early onset Alzheimer’s.

                                 FRANK BELL
                        Show me the way to go home.  I’m 
                        tired and I want to go to bed.  Had 
                        a little drink about an hour ago...

           Frank stops, his chin dipping down like he fell asleep.  Bell 
           answers a text on her Blackberry.  Beyond, a NURSE’S AIDE 
           makes one of the three other empty beds in the room.

                                 NURSE'S AIDE
                        Is Mr. Bell your father?

                                 BELL
                        Yes he is.

                                 NURSE'S AIDE
                        So young.  It’s such a shame.

           Bell doesn’t answer.

                                 NURSE'S AIDE (CONT’D)
                        He has Alzheimer’s, right?

           Annoyed, Bell stops texting, looks over.

                                 BELL
                        Yeah.  Early onset they call it.

           The Aide shakes her head as she tucks in the sheet.

                                 NURSE'S AIDE
                        God, it’s so wrong.

           Bell starts to answer, stops herself.  She looks at her 
           father a beat more, tries to see past his dementia.

                                 BELL
                        You know how I knew there was 
                        something wrong with him?  He 
                        forgot to feed his dog.

           The Aide’s not sure what to say.

                        Almost done.  Be outta here in a 
                        second.

           She continues working.  Bell sits quietly.  Frank nods.  Dust 
           motes float through a slash of light that splits the room.  
           The Aide tries to salvage the moment, smiles at Bell.

           floor, Pistol (camouflage mask) zeros in, starts toward her.

                                 PISTOL
                        Not you.  Up.

           Before she can rise, he yanks her to her feet.

                                 PISTOL (CONT’D)
                        Vault keys.

           She hesitates and - WHAM! -  He backhands her viciously 
           across the mouth.  But stays measured.

                                 PISTOL (CONT’D)
                        Vault keys.

           Blood running out both nostrils, she opens a desk drawer, 
           fishes out a set of keys.  

           Pistol grabs her by the wrist, pulls her along.  As he 
           crosses the lobby, he picks up an escort in Machinegun #1.  

           Machinegun #2 vaults up onto the counter of a teller window.  
           He stands, head on a swivel, playing ‘centerfield’.  A pro.

           VAULT DOOR

           Hands shaking, the manager gets the key in the lock.  She has 
           trouble muscling up the mechanism.  Pistol reaches across, 
           yanks it up, pushes in the door to reveal a small pallet of 
           shrink wrapped $100 BILLS.

           LOBBY

           Machinegun #2 cups his hand over his EAR MIC as he listens to 
           RADIO TRAFFIC.  He shouts over his shoulder.

                                 MACHINEGUN #2
                        I got units responding to a silent 
                        alarm!
           Even as he shouts it, Pistol and Machinegun #1 appear out the 
           vault, each carrying a heavy canvas sack across the lobby.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. BANK OF AMERICA PARKING LOT - GLENDALE - DAY

           As they exit the bank, a SQUEAL of tires.  A 1995 BMW 5-
           series barrels up, stops hard.  The three bank robbers pile 
           in.  Before the doors have closed, they are rocketing across 
           the parking lot and fishtail a left out onto Lexington Drive.

           BMW

           We’re looking over several sets of shoulders through the 
           windshield as they speed through traffic.  It’s 70 mph in a 
           35 mph zone.  No one says a word.  Not an ‘oh shit’, nothing.

           CORNER OF LEXINGTON & ORANGE

           As the BMW shudders a left turn onto Orange -- Through the 
           windshield, they bear down on a JAYWALKER.  They swerve 
           around him, suddenly slowing way down.

           CALIFORNIA AVENUE

           They turn at the speed limit, fitting in now as they travel 
           100 yards, turn into...

           A PARKING GARAGE

           The BMW parks in a spot.  We’re low on the ground; all we see 
           are feet as doors open and four men exit.  Quickly, but with 
           no panic, nothing to draw attention.  Two carry the bags.  

           We stay on pistol.  We know it’s him because we see him shove 
           the pistol down into the small of his back.  His other hand 
           holds the neoprene mask.  He gets into a WHITE SEDAN even as 
           we hear other car doors open and close around him.

           WHITE SEDAN

           In the backseat over his shoulder as he flips on a POLICE 
           SCANNER and backs out.  “211 in progress.”

           PARKING GARAGE

           Four cars exit the garage the first three all turn left onto 
           California.  The white sedan turns right.

           WHITE SEDAN

           Rolls the speed limit.  We feel more than see Pistol pull off 
           his jacket toss it in the back.  Sirens.  A PATROL CAR speeds 
           past, turns a hard left ahead.  Amazingly, Pistol follows it.
           We see other patrol cars blocking the intersection ahead as 
           the one that just passed him pulls into the parking lot of...

           THE BANK OF AMERICA

           Pistol is returning to the scene of the crime!  We exit the 
           car, over his shoulder as he steps out.  A YOUNG PATROLMAN 
           stepping toward him.

                                 YOUNG PATROLMAN
                        Sir, move your car.  This is a 
                        crime scene.

                                 PISTOL’S VOICE
                        It’s okay.

           We see the back of his BADGE as he holds it up.  We reverse 
           to show the man holding it is Roman Cahill.

                                 ROMAN
                        LAPD.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. LOBBY - BANK OF AMERICA - DAY

           The patrolman leading Roman in.  The police have huddled all 
           employees and customer to one end of the lobby.  Several 
           woman are CRYING, hugging each other.

                                 ROMAN
                        Listen!  We are going to interview 
                        you and get you home as quick as 
                        possible!  You are safe and sound!

           Something big and comforting about the way he takes charge.  
           And he continues straight toward the bank manager he struck.  
           She sits in a chair holding a wad of paper towels to her 
           bloody face.  Another woman rubs her back.

           Roman kneels down in front of her, his face a foot from hers.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           She nods, her eyes welled with tears.  He reaches over...

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Let me see.

           She lowers the wadding.  He very gently examines her, smiles.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        It hurts worse than it looks.  Did 
                        you see what they looked like?
                                 BANK MANAGER
                        They had masks.
                               (starts to cry)
                        I thought they’d kill me.

           He takes her in his arms.  As she hangs on...

                                 ROMAN
                        Shhh...  It’s okay, sweetheart.  
                        Shhh...  Everything’s okay. 

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. MOM & POP MUSIC STORE - ECHO PARK - DAY

           Luna stands on the sidewalk cooling his heels.  Finally looks 
           back over his shoulder.  

           Through the glass he sees: Grimes talking to a CLERK behind 
           the counter.  Grimes is describing something.  He swings a 
           forefinger like he’s ‘conducting’.  He’s not ‘describing’ 
           something; he’s ‘la-la-la-ing’ something.

           The clerk just shrugs and shakes his head, has no idea.  A 
           beat and Grimes is headed for the door.  As he hits the 
           sidewalk, Luna already has to hurry to catch.

                                 LUNA
                        You find what you were looking for?

           Grimes shakes his head.  They’re passing Echo Lake, Angelus 
           Temple ahead.  As they cross a side street, Luna cranes his 
           neck looking for something he isn’t seeing.

                                 LUNA (CONT’D)
                        You know what else we can’t find?  
                        Wherever the fuck it is where 
                        supposed to be working

                                 GRIMES
                               (pointing)
                        Sunset’s that way.

           They keep walking.  After a bit...

                                 LUNA
                        Know what I’m thinking of, man?

           Luna pulls a rolled up CATALOG from his back pocket.

                                 LUNA (CONT’D)
                        Santa Monica College.  Huh?  
                        Business major. 
                               (a few more steps)
                        So?  What do you think?
                                 SIDNEY
                        I don’t really see you in a cap and 
                        gown, but, go for it.

           They reach SUNSET BOULEVARD.  Grimes looks right then left.

                                 GRIMES
                        There.

           Grimes starts left with Luna catching up.  Ahead: the SUNSET 
           AUTOSPA car wash.  Guys with rags in their hands.

                                 LUNA
                        It’s gonna be a long day, dude.

                                 GRIMES
                        Better get that college application 
                        filled out.

           As Luna nods, a TRICKED OUT LEXUS pulls up, matches their 
           walking speed.  CASTRO, a serious gangbanger with a little 
           Master Po beard leans out the window of the passenger seat.

                                 CASTRO
                        Hey, Flaco!  What’s up, man!

           Luna looks like he’d rather it was anyone else in the world.

                                 LUNA
                        Hey, Castro.  You know.  Sunny day, 
                        on my way to work.  It’s all good.

                                 CASTRO
                        Where were you last night.  We 
                        threw you a party.  You don’t show 
                        up for your own party?

                                 LUNA
                        Got a curfew, man.

                                 CASTRO
                        Curfew?!

           The guys in the Lexus all LAUGH it up.  Luna stares ahead 
           grimly, marches ahead grimly.  Grimes still with him.

                                 LUNA
                        That’s right.  And now I gotta 
                        work, man.

                                 CASTRO
                        Where you working?

                                 LUNA
                               (points)
                        Car wash.
           Castro rests his chin on his forearm, darkly amused.

                                 CASTRO
                        But you already got a job, Skinny.  
                        Hasta La Meurte, huh?  We take that 
                        fucking shit serious.

           Luna nods, doesn’t answer.  Grimes finally looks over at 
           Castro (they never stop walking).  Castro takes exception.  
           Some serious guy-eye-contact-shit going on.

                                 CASTRO (CONT’D)
                        What are you looking at?

           Grimes just shakes his head.  ‘Nothing’.  Passing on the 
           confrontation, he continues on his way into the car wash 
           parking lot.  Luna stops, waiting on Castro.  

                                 CASTRO (CONT’D)
                        Who’s the fucking gabacho?

                                 LUNA
                        Ex-con, man.  Same as me.

                                 CASTRO
                               (mocking)
                        Same as you...  Same as all of us.  

           The guys in the Lexus all agree.

                                 CASTRO (CONT’D)
                        Be smart, man.  Huh?

                                 LUNA
                        Trying to be.  I gotta go to work.

           Luna quickens his pace.

                                 CASTRO
                        Do good, huh?!  Get some tips!

           The boys all laugh as the Lexus SCREECHES a hard U-turn, 
           hauls down Sunset back the other way.

                                                                  CUT TO:

                        Until death.  That’s how you leave 
                        a gang.

           Grimes tosses him a rag continues past; Luna is exasperated.

                        What the fuck am I telling you for?

           EXT. KUSTOM - NORTH HOLLYWOOD - DAY

           A pimp my ride enterprise.  We’re across and down the street 
           from it.  Inside a very plain CHEVY CAPRICE.  Fowler behind 
           the wheel, Bell alongside.  She smokes a cigarette.

                                 BELL
                        Bank records say this place is 
                        turning a profit.  I don’t buy it.  

           Fowler unwraps the foil off a POP TART, offers her one.

                                 FOWLER
                        It’s a two pack.

                               (puffs cigarette)
                        But smoke.  It just drifts.

           As Fowler bites into one, the security gate at Kustom starts 
           to roll back.  They watch as a stem-to-stern tricked out 
           ESCALADE rolls out.  Roman behind the wheel.  

           He turns, heads down the street; the Caprice follows.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Luna walking toward Grimes, tosses him his rag.

                        Lunch, baby.  I got five bucks in

                        around the corner.

           Grimes tosses Luna back his rag and his own.

                        I’ll take a rain check.  Got

           One of those clapboarded LA houses never swallowed up by 
           apartment building.  The Harbor Freeway looms beyond as 
           PITBULLS patrols a chain link pen nailed to the side.  

           A sofa on the porch.  A grizzled 33-year-old sitting there.  
           BURGESS.  As tough as they fucking come.  He frowns at the 
           white man crossing the street toward him.  It’s Grimes.

           Burgess moves his hand to the butt of a .38 between the 
           cushions.  Grimes holds a section of NEWSPAPER in his hand.

                                 GRIMES
                        I’m looking for Burgess.

                                 BURGESS
                        Ain’t no Burgess around here, 
                        white.  All we got is Farm Dog 
                        Crips.  So keep strollin’.

                                 GRIMES
                        I was in Victorville with your 
                        cousin.

           Burgess considers his options, his hand still on the .38.

                                 BURGESS
                        Got a whole mess of cousins.

                                 GRIMES
                        This one’s Little Nate.  Like I 
                        said, Victorville.

           A beat as Burgess chews his bottom lip, considers.

                                 BURGESS 
                        You Grimes?  You the boy Nate said 
                        was coming by?

           Grimes nods.  Burgess considers a beat.

                                 BURGESS (CONT’D)
                        Pull up your shirt.

           Grimes pulls up his shirt.  Even more white skin on display.

                                 BURGESS (CONT’D)
                        Turn so I can see.

           Knowing what he’s looking for, Grimes turns to display the 
           screwdriver stab scars on his side.  

                                 BURGESS (CONT’D)
                        Little Nate said he owed you.  That 
                        what he owed you?
           ANGLE FROM INSIDE HOUSE

           Someone watching through the screen as Grimes lowers the 
           shirt, steps up on the porch.

                                 GRIMES
                        Ten years ago I went up on a felony 
                        possession charge.

           PORCH

                                 GRIMES (CONT’D)
                        A dealer named Eddie Rowland copped 
                        a deal with the DA.  Pled down a 
                        strike three felony, a life 
                        sentence to 15 months in exchange 
                        for saying I ripped him off.

                                 BURGESS
                        I’d make that deal all day long.

                                 GRIMES
                        A week after he got out, Eddie 
                        Rowland got killed in a drive-by.  
                        Unsolved.  Wrong place at the wrong 
                        time.  Unless you say different.

           Burgess laughs, genuinely thinks this is funny.

                                 BURGESS
                        Little Nate being my cousin and him 
                        owing you don’t mean I gotta 
                        confess to no murder.

           The door bursts open and some 18-year-old KID steps out, a 
           PISTOL aimed about three feet away from Grimes’ head.

                                 KID
                        Step back the fucking way you 
                        fucking came, mutherfucker!

           Grimes just blinks.

                                 BURGESS
                        Yo, put it away, Superman.  It’s 
                        all friendly.

           The kid glances back to Burgess who nods his head.  As he 
           lowers the pistol --

           WHAM!  Grimes buries his fist in the kid’s face.  Once.  Then 
           arcs in an elbow.  CRACK.  The kid lands in a heap.  Grimes 
           takes the gun away, holds it where he can see it.
                                 GRIMES
                        You point this at a man’s head, you 
                        pull the trigger.  Understand?

           That said, Grimes wings the gun into the WEEDS of the side 
           yard.  Burgess watches it all, amused.

                                 BURGESS
                               (laughing again)
                        Okay, white, okay.  It was like 
                        this.  Eddie Rowland lived in the 
                        neighborhood.  Man comes and pays 
                        good money.  Man says to make it 
                        look like a drive-by.  Simple.

                                 GRIMES
                        Does the man got a name?

                                 BURGESS
                        Barack Obama.

           Grimes holds out the newspaper.  

                                 GRIMES
                        Was that him?

           Burgess takes it.  An LA Times metro section article on 
           Childress getting killed.  A PHOTO OF CHILDRESS.  Burgess 
           looks it over a beat, shakes his head as he hands it back.

                                 BURGESS
                        No.  But the man who ‘employed’ me 
                        was the police.

                                 GRIMES
                        How did you know?

                                 BURGESS
                        By looking at him.  Same way you 
                        know I’m a gangster.  

                                 GRIMES
                        That’s it?

                                 BURGESS
                        That’s it.  That’s all being tight 
                        with Little Nate in Victorville 
                        gets you.

                                 GRIMES
                        Thanks for your time.

           Grimes starts off.  Burgess looks to the kid trying to sit 
           up, chuckles to himself.
                                 BURGESS
                        Thanks for my time...
                               (calls out)
                        White!

           Grimes turns back.

                                 BURGESS (CONT’D)
                        Few years later I saw him.  At a 
                        goddamn hot dog stand.  He didn’t 
                        see me.  Dog I was rollin’ with 
                        knew his name.  It was like Dallas 
                        or Denver, a city or some shit.

                                 GRIMES
                        Roman?  Was it Roman?

                                 BURGESS
                        I believe it was.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. SUNSET AUTOSPA - SUNSET & ALVARADO - DAY

           Luna dries a fender.  The seedy looking MANAGER steps over.

                                 MANAGER
                        Where’s your buddy?  Lunch break’s 
                        over.

                                 LUNA
                        No entiendo.

                                 MANAGER
                        Cut the shit.  I know you speak 
                        English.

           Even as he glares at Luna, Grimes walks past with a rag and 
           starts wiping down the car as well.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  What don’t you understand 
                        about a half hour lunch?  Huh?

           Grimes doesn’t answer, just keeps wiping.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have a job, means you 
                        violate parole.  Understand?  Hey, 
                        I’m talking to you, jack-off!

           Grimes straightens, considers him.  A daunting consideration.  
           The manager looks away.  Grimes goes back to work.  The 
           manager takes gives Luna a face saving look and then goes.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           EXT./INT. PARKED CHEVY CAPRICE - SUNSET BOULEVARD - DAY

           Still following the Escalade.  Bell flips through an old file 
           as Fowler drives.

           THE ESCALADE

           Glides, weaving effortlessly through slower traffic.

                                 BELL’S VOICE
                        They go separate ways, working 
                        different squads.

                                 FOWLER’S VOICE
                        Trying to make bones for sergeant.

           THE CHEVY CAPRICE

           Hangs a couple of cars back.

                                 BELL
                        Then Grimes ends up with Childress 
                        and it all goes south.

                        strike dealer named Eddie Rowland 
                        testifies Grimes ripped him off.  
                        At first Grimes says he was set up, 
                        then he changes his plea to guilty.  
                        Gets ten years in Victorville.

                        He’s stopping.

           Fowler pulls to the curb, stops as they watch the Escalade 
           pull into the SUNSET AUTOSPA.
           SUNSET AUTOSPA

           Grimes looks up as Roman hops out of the Escalade.  Tossing 
           his keys to an attendant, Roman walks past Grimes without 
           saying hello.  As he disappears into the MANAGER’S OFFICE...

           CHEVY CAPRICE

           Bell and Fowler exchange a look.

           MANAGER’S OFFICE

           From the outside looking in.  Roman sits across from the 
           manager.  Roman is doing all the talking.  Just once the 
           manager looks out to where Grimes dries another car.

           THE ESCALADE

           On the wash line.  Leaving the soapy ribbons behind.  Getting 
           blasted by the rinse jets.

           CHEVY CAPRICE

           Bell watches Grimes with something approaching disgust.

                                 BELL
                        You believe that guy was once a

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - SUNSET AUTOSPA - DAY

           We’re inside now as the manager considers TWENTY $100 BILLS 
           spread across his desk.  Roman checks his watch.

                                 ROMAN
                        You can play with it later.

           THE ESCALADE

           Luna drives it over from the washer, hops out.  As he and 
           Grimes starts to wipe it down, Roman emerges from the 
           manager’s office, beelines Grimes.

                        Get in.

           Roman gets behind the wheel.  A beat and then Grimes gets in 
           the passenger seat.  He stares at an exasperated Roman.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)

           Roman hits the gas.  The Escalade jumps as they screech out 
           of the lot leaving Luna standing watching, rag in hand.

           ESCALADE

           Fowler pulls out after them (it’s a follow not a chase).

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey, Roman.

           The BARTENDER is in a leather halter, has a sexy Cherokee 
           feather thing going.  Roman leans across the bar, kisses her 
           on the mouth.

                                 ROMAN

                        Don’t know.

           He kisses her again, winks.

                                 ROMAN
                        It’s fear.  The same thing that 
                        keeps ‘em apart.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. CHEVY CAPRICE - PARKED ACROSS FROM THE SHORT STOP - DAY

           Window down as Bell smokes a cigarette.  She drags with a 
           vengeance, pulling the smoke down to her toes.  

                                 BELL
                        Two crooked cops.  Childress 
                        established, Grimes stepping on his 
                        toes.  They lock horns.  Childress 
                        is smarter; sends Grimes up.  
                        Grimes gets out, proves two things.  
                        One, he holds a grudge.  And two, 
                        he does not waste time.

           Fowler doesn’t look convinced.
                                 FOWLER
                        Or Grimes is new to the crew.  
                        Figures out it’s dirty.  Childress 
                        can’t suborn him, so he sets him 
                        up.  That’s how Grimes testified.

                                 BELL
                        Until he changed his plea.
                               (Fowler shrugs)
                        All cops are guilty, Ron.  You’re 
                        the only honest one I ever met.

           Fowler nudges her, points out the bartender on her way over 
           on spiked heels. She carries a tray with TWO GLASSES OF BEER.  

                                 BARTENDER
                        Compliments of the gentlemen 
                        inside.

           Bell takes a last drag of her cigarette, spears the butt down 
           into one of the glasses.  It extinguishes with a hiss.

                                 BELL
                        Fuck off.  Or I’ll do it for you.

           The bartender turns and heads back, beer glasses rattling.  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. THE SHORT STOP - DAY

           Boilermakers.  Roman drops his shot into his beer, raises it 
           to Grimes then downs half of it.  Grimes’ shot and beer 
           remain untouched on the bar. 

                                 ROMAN
                        Christ, you are wound up tight.

                        I want Sidney Grimes.  Back in my 
                        life.  It has been a goddamn lonely 
                        decade without you.

           The bartender returns with the tray.  

                                 BARTENDER
                        Fucking ballbuster, man.

           Roman clocks Bell’s cigarette in the glass, grins.

           Something deadly in the request and Roman clocks it.

           Sidney wipes his palm across the bar, taking the water rings 
           with it.  With a snap of his wrist, he flicks the water to 
           the floor.  Looks down at the drops.

                                 GRIMES

           Roman like an eager kid.  Grimes considers.  Finally...

                        Now you’re talking!  

           Roman hands Grimes his beer, takes Grimes’ shot, raises it.

                        goddamn time.
           Roman clinks Grimes’ glass.  They both take a stiff drink.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Bell and Fowler watch as Grimes and Roman exit.  Roman nudges 
           Grimes, points them out.  Bell and Grimes lock eyes.  Just 
           happens.  Like two thirds of a love triangle meeting for the 
           first time.  The spell is broken as...

                        You’re the expert.  You tell me.

           As Roman and Grimes continue on their way, we end on Bell and 
           Fowler.  Fishing out a cigarette, she breaks it in half by 
           accident, flings the whole pack at the windshield.  Fowler 
           watches her will herself to calm down.  Finally:

           The car passes him before SLAMMING to a stop.  As Luna cuts 
           across the street, the boys pile out and jackal after him.  
           Luna coming right at us.  The boys filling frame behind him 
           as they hunt him down.  Hands reach out and --

           -- Down Luna goes.  A moment later they have him slung up 
           against a chain link fence.  As he bounces off it, they punch 
           him back into it.  Castro strolls over, no running for him.  
           As he watches them work Luna over...
           ESCALADE

           Roman’s dropping Grimes off.  

                                 ROMAN
                        You like this car?  I’ll get one 
                        made up for you.

                                 GRIMES
                        Not my style.

           They see Luna getting beat up.  Roman’s going to roll past.

                                 ROMAN
                        Somebody pissed somebody off.

                                 GRIMES
                        Stop the car.

           Roman stops.  Castro and his boys all turn as the brakes 
           chirp.  Castro spots Grimes, starts strolling over.

                                 CASTRO
                        What the fuck you looking at now?

           Roman holds his BADGE out the window.  Castro stops short.

                                 ROMAN
                        My amusement is a temporary state 
                        of grace as far as you fellas go.

                                 CASTRO
                        Just looking after some business.

                                 ROMAN
                        Look after it someplace else, Paco.

           Castro’s eyes flash dark.  He turns, heads for the Lexus, 
           literally WHISTLING for his road dogs to follow.  They do.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)

                        God bless, gangbangers.  I paid for 
                        my house up in Big Bear off them.

           As the Lexus rolls out...

                                 GRIMES
                        Talk to you later.

           Grimes starts to get out of the car.

                                 ROMAN
                        Hey...
           Roman takes out a cash wad, peels off maybe $1,000, holds it 
           out.  Grimes just stares at it.  Finally, Roman sticks it in 
           Grimes’ shirt pocket.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        God love you, Sidney.  No one else 
                        will.

           LUNA

           Hands on his knees, ass against the fence, he leans over as 
           the blood drips off his nose onto the sidewalk.  Beat down, 
           he looks up as Grimes steps over.  Escalade headed off.

                                 GRIMES
                        You okay?

                                 LUNA
                        What the fuck do you care, man?

           Grimes consider him, then reaches down and picks up the Santa 
           Monica College catalog from the dirt where it fell.  He wipes 
           it off, holds it out.  Luna wants to cry, but doesn’t.  
           Instead, he reaches out and takes it from him.

           As Grimes continues toward the halfway house...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INTERNAL AFFAIRS CAPTAIN BOWLIN - IN HIS OFFICE

           BOWLIN sits before a dozen commendations and a bank of photos 
           of himself.  He flips through a thick FILE, pausing here and 
           there, but mostly flipping.  Bell and Fowler across from him.

                                 BELL
                        Sir, if you could, back up.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN
                        Excuse me?

           Impatient, she stands, leans across to flip back a few pages.  
           Captain Bowlin leans away.  She doesn’t see him check out her 
           ass, but Fowler does.  As Bowlin feels his eyes, he gives him 
           a grin.  Fowler’s expression stays dead neutral. 

                                 BELL
                        Right there.

           Annoyed, he looks down.  She sits.  Bowlin reads until...

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN
                        Raymond Childress is dead.  Dead 
                        and before that retired, correct?  
                        I once served with Childress on a 
                        joint narcotics task force.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN (CONT'D)
                        Does that put me in this file, too?  
                        The subject is Roman Cahill.

                                 BELL
                        We think Cahill was laundering cash 
                        through Childress’ security 
                        business.  Hardwick, Metcalf, 
                        Dockery, all the men in Cahill’s 
                        crew are listed as part time 
                        employees.  They’re all pulling 
                        down 30K a year.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN
                        A lot of cops work security jobs 
                        for Childress.  He built a good 
                        business.  All it proves is the 
                        city doesn’t pay enough.

                                 BELL
                        Cahill owns a custom car business.  
                        Ray Childress loaned him the money 
                        to start it up.  So far Cahill 
                        hasn’t paid back a dime.  It’s 
                        classic money laundering.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN

                        slack.
                               (a beat)
                        How long have you been on this?

                                 FOWLER
                        Two years.  On and off.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN
                        And you’re aware of IA policy?  To 
                        complete all investigations within 
                        a 4 to 6 month period?

                                 FOWLER
                        Bottom line, Sir: Cahill’s a risk 
                        to the community, the department 
                        and to himself.

           Bowlin sets down the file, picks up another one.  It also 
           says ROMAN CAHILL.  It’s his official record.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN
                        That’s not what it says here.  This 
                        says top 5% in convictions and 
                        arrests.  This says Distinguished 
                        Service Medal, Two Police Stars and 
                        one Police Medal for Heroism.  

           As Fowler and Bell exchange a frustrated look.
                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN (CONT’D)
                        Two years and you haven’t got 
                        enough direct evidence here to even 
                        recommend administrative leave.    

           Captain Bowlin flips through the file, holds up a page.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN (CONT’D)
                        Are you really going after him for 
                        ‘developing personal relationships 
                        with informants’?

                                 BELL
                        He provides prostitutes with heroin 
                        in exchange for sex.  Should I have 
                        just written blow job?  A field 
                        plea bargain?  Would you understand 
                        then?  

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN
                        Sergeant, you are out of line.

           Fowler makes a sign to her below desk with his hand: DESIST.  

                                 FOWLER
                        Cahill’s worked narcotics, vice and 
                        intelligence.  By request.  The big 
                        three in the temptation department.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        So he’s a cowboy.  He likes the 
                        action.  But he’s filed financial 
                        disclosures and come up clean.  

           Bowlin picks up another piece of paper, disgusted by it.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN
                        And now you want to drag Sidney 
                        Grimes into it?  Disgraced 
                        policeman?  Murder suspect?

                                 BELL
                        He connects this.  He’ll get us 
                        Cahill; I know it.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN
                               (sarcastic)
                        You want to grant him immunity on 
                        the Childress homicide?  Grimes is 
                        circumstantial.  And circumstantial 
                        is only admissable if it logically 
                        relates the subject officer to the 
                        alleged misconduct.

                                 BELL
                        We’ve read the manual, Sir.
                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN
                        Read it again!  

                                 BELL
                        Are you saying to drop it?

                                 CAPTAIN BOWLIN
                        I’m saying prove it.  Objectively 
                        and in a timely manner.  I’ll give 
                        you two more weeks to wrap this up 
                        one way or the other.  That’s all.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Grimes stands at a listening station, HEADPHONES on.  A CLERK 
           stands alongside, forefinger ready.  Grimes shakes his head - 
           The Clerk advances to the next track - Grimes -shakes his 
           head again - The clerk advances - And so on.  Until --

           Frustration growing, Grimes tosses the headset down on the 
           rack and stalks out.  As the Clerk watches him go...

           two big garbage bags from the back.  Move with him as he 
           crosses his shop, half a dozen GUYS at work.

           ROCKET, as tall as he is wide, holds a JOYSTICK remote unit, 
           uses it to ‘BOUNCE’ a ‘62 Chevy Impala convertible across the

           music plays from the car’s stereo.

           Hardwick steps to the table, picks up a banded stack.

                               (steps to Hardwick)
                        I don’t ‘gotta’ do anything for 
                        you, Hardie.

                                 HARDWICK
                        My fucking old lady is breathing 
                        down my neck, okay?  I need some 
                        money?  You guys can charge me 
                        fucking interest if you want to.

           Roman’s not happy with Hardwick.  Metcalf and Dockery look 
           concerned as well.

                                 HARDWICK (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck it.

           Hardwick storms out.  As the three cops exchange looks.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. EMPLOYEE REST ROOM STALL - KUSTOM - DAY

           Hardwick sits on the closed toilet cooking a SPOON OF HEROIN.  
           On the wall behind him is taped a magazine photo of a tricked 
           out OLDS CUTLASS.  Across it someone has written with a 
           Sharpie: Jerk off to this.  Hardwick draws up the syringe.  
           As he rolls up one pant leg, the main bathroom door opens.

           Hardwick pauses as feet cross the floor.  Suddenly, his stall 
           door IS KICKED IN revealing Roman.  Hardwick drops the 
           syringe as Roman grabs him by the throat, hauls him up.

                                 HARDWICK
                        -- the fuck, Roman?!

                                 ROMAN
                        What’re you doing?!

                                 HARDWICK
                        It’s my business.

                                 ROMAN
                        Not when we count on you it’s not.  

                                 HARDWICK
                               (pushes him off)
                        I can handle it.

                                 ROMAN
                        Know what happens if they bust you?  
                                 HARDWICK
                        It’ll be my problem.

                                 ROMAN
                        No!  My problem!  IA, that fucking 
                        bitch Bell, they’ll offer you a 
                        deal.  They’ll wire you up; they’ll 
                        have you roll on me.  End of story.

           Hardwick would rather look for his syringe.  Roman steps 
           back, watches him with contempt as he casts about.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        No one can count on a junkie.  The 
                        shit always comes first. 

           Hardwick finds it, looks up at Roman from the bathroom floor.

                                 HARDWICK
                        I’m not a junkie.

                                 ROMAN
                        And my grandma wears army boots.
                               (mocking)
                        Oh please, Roman, front me some 
                        cash.  Let me pay interest.

           Roman squats down, looks Hardwick dead in the eye.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Never want anything more than you 
                        want self-respect.  Look at you.  

           Hardwick breaks down, starts to cry.  Roman reaches out, 
           rests his hand on his shoulder.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        You want help, man?  I am here.  
                        But you gotta want it.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           SIDNEY GRIMES - IN HIS ROOM

           PUSH-UPS.  His punishing prison regimen.  Deep, nose to the 
           fucking floor.  The voice in his head:

                                 CARLY’S VOICE
                        Hey, Mr. Blue.  You know what 
                        happened today?

           And the distorted SOPRANO bleeds in: “Sì,sì ci voglio andare! 
           e se l'amassi invano, andrei sul Ponte Vecchio ma per 
           buttarmi in Arno!”

                                                              JUMP CUT TO:
           GRIMES 

           On his back in bed, its frame pushed in front of the door.  
           Grimes stares up at the ceiling lost in thought.  Again as 
           before, we feel rather than see, someone in bed beside him.

                                 CARLY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        I broke a glass.  Except I didn’t 
                        know if it was a dream or not.  But 
                        I cleaned it up anyway because I 
                        thought you might step on it like 
                        remember that time on our 
                        honeymoon?  But it must’ve been a 
                        dream.  The glass that is.  

           A woman’s hand reaches over, an IV taped into the back of it.  
           The hand rests by Grimes’ shoulder.  Ghost-like.

                                 CARLY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Mr. Blue, I don’t like feeling 
                        this way.  All inside out.  It’s 
                        not what I planned.  But know what 
                        they say?  If you want to make God 
                        laugh, tell him your plan...  It’s 
                        so random.  That’s what’s so 
                        obscene about it.  I mean, it’s not 
                        like asking someone to dance.  
                        Picking someone.  You know?  It 
                        picks you.  And everything that’s 
                        so important disappears.  Even a 
                        glass.  Even a scar on your foot.

           A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.  Grimes snaps to.  The hand is gone.  
           The KNOCK still there.

                                 GRIMES
                        Who is it?

                                 SAFARIS’ VOICE
                        Your parole officer.  Open up.

           Grimes is not happy.  He reaches to the bed for his shirt.  
           As he puts it on, we hear a KEY IN THE LOCK.

           The door is pushed open, but catches on the bed that’s been 
           pushed in front of it.  We see Safaris as he sticks his nose 
           through the crack.  As he shoulders it to little effect --

           -- Grimes pulls the bed back away across the floor.

           Safaris enters followed by Bell and Fowler.  Safaris makes 
           the “turn around” gesture with his finger. 

                                 SAFARIS
                        Against the wall.
           Grimes grudgingly acquiesces.  Assumes the position.  Safaris 
           steps up behind him, looks to Bell; he’s waiting on her.

                                 BELL
                        What were you and Roman talking 
                        about today?

                                 GRIMES
                               (facing wall)
                        I don’t think I got your name.

                                 BELL
                        Bell.

                                 GRIMES
                        Let me guess.  Your first name is 
                        sergeant.

           A beat.  Traffic outside.  Bell looks to Safaris, nods.  

           In full view of Bell and Fowler, Safaris pulls a BAGGY of 
           CRYSTAL METH from his own pocket.  As he performs a few 
           perfunctory pats down Grimes’ back...

                                 SAFARIS
                        The 4th Amendment has forsaken you, 
                        Grimes.  And you need a shower.

           Safaris reaches into Grimes’ pants pocket, ‘pretends’ to find 
           his own baggy.  Obviously just a dumb show as he dangles it 
           in front of Grimes’ face. 

                                 SAFARIS (CONT’D)
                        To top it off, you are officially 
                        in violation of your parole.

           Grimes turns, leans back against the wall.  Contemptuous.

                                 BELL
                        So what were you and Roman talking 
                        about today?

           Grimes looks over at Fowler who’s back by the door.  Fowler 
           looks away.  Not very proud of what they are doing.

           Safaris starts to drift around the room, looking it over.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        Please take this very seriously.  
                        Cooperate and you will stay on the 
                        street.  Don’t and you won’t. 

                                 GRIMES
                        You’re as bad as the cops you go 
                        after.
                                 BELL
                        And you’re a choir boy, right?  
                        Know what you’re gonna do for me?

           Safaris lifts the mattress, looks under it.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        You are going to cozy up with 
                        Roman.  Like the good old days.  
                        You are going to tell me everything 
                        you find out.  You are going to 
                        wear a wire when I tell you to.  
                        You are going to do all that and 
                        more or you go back to prison.

           As Safaris pulls open another drawer of the dresser...  

                                 SAFARIS
                        You had snitches when you were a 
                        cop, didn’t you?  How does it feel 
                        to be someone’s snitch?

                                 BELL
                        What’s it gonna be?

           Safaris pulls out Grimes’ car wash PAYSTUBS, realizes...

                                 SAFARIS
                        What the Hell?!  Pay stub for next 
                        week, the week after, and the week 
                        after that.
                               (to Grimes)
                        Sonuvabitch.

                                 BELL
                               (realizing)
                        Roman’s a good buddy, huh?  

           Safaris reaches in the drawer for Grimes’ wallet.

                                 SAFARIS
                        What else you got, Grimes, next 
                        week’s winning lottery ticket?
                               (looks through wallet)
                        One state ID... Too much fucking 
                        cash... What’s this?

           He pulls out a wallet-sized PHOTO.  Grimes goes even colder 
           than he already is.  A photo of CARLY GRIMES: a disarming 
           candid shot of her smiling at something.

                                 SAFARIS (CONT’D)
                        Or should I say, who’s this?

                                 GRIMES
                        Put it back.
                                 SAFARIS
                        Say please, fuck-face.

           He waves it at Sidney -- Sidney moves past Bell to take it.  
           As Safaris jerks it away, the photo is TORN IN HALF.

           A beat and Sidney Grimes goes clean off.  Grabs Safaris by 
           the throat and rams him back through the dresser.  Holds him 
           against the wall -- WHUMP!  And WHUMP!  And WHUMP!  Until --

           Fowler flies in from the left, tries to pull him off.

           As Grimes takes another swing -- WHUMP! -- Bell digs her 
           thumb up into Grimes’ carotid in a blood choke.  A moment and 
           Grimes drops.  

           Fowler tends to Safaris.  Blood pouring out of his broken 
           nose, a wide split across the bridge.

                                 FOWLER
                        Hold still.

           Fowler grabs the pillow from the bed, shakes the PILLOWCASE 
           off of it.  He bunches it up, presses it over Safaris’ nose.

           Fowler turns back to Grimes who’s groggy but coming around.

           Bell picks up the two photo pieces.  She looks at it a beat, 
           back to a coughing Grimes, over to Safaris.  Jesus.

           Safaris lurches to his feet.  He waves Fowler off, lowers the 
           pillowcase to look in the dresser mirror.  Holy shit.  He 
           turns, looks at Grimes who manages to get himself sitting.

                                 SAFARIS
                        You fucked up, you dumb bastard.  
                        Your ass’ll be in County tonight 
                        and Victorville by tomorrow noon.  
                        Hope you had a nice parole, you 
                        Neanderthal mutherfucker.

           The words ring out.  Grimes looks over at Bell.

                                 GRIMES
                        I’m all yours.
                               (to Safaris)
                        Guess I gotta stay on the street to 
                        be any use.

           Safaris looks to Bell who just shrugs: sorry.  As Safaris 
           stalks out of the room...

           Grimes looks from the pieces of the photo Bell holds to her.  
           She offers them to him.  As he gently takes them from her...

                                                                  CUT TO:
           EXT. MACARTHUR PARK - LOS ANGELES - SUNSET

           A familiar beat-up sedan rolls 7th STREET.  Metcalf behind 
           the wheel, Roman alongside.  Hardwick and Dockery in the back 
           as they turn down the ALLEYWAY between Grand View and Lake...

                                 METCALF
                        Who called it in?

           Dockery ‘counts’ buildings they pass...

                                 ROMAN
                        I got it through Rollins in intel.

           the trunk as he exits.  They all pull out SHOTGUNS.  As 
           Dockery adjusts the Velcro on his ‘POLICE’ emblazoned KEVLAR

           INT. GRAND VIEW APARTMENT STAIRWELL - SUNSET

           A 60-year-old LATINO WOMAN on a 3rd floor landing, bouncing a 
           crying TODDLER on her hip as she lights a Virginia Slims.  
           The flame never reaches the butt as she sees Roman and the 
           Boys advance up from the lower landing.
           Roman places a forefinger across his lips.  Shhh...  He stops 
           by her as the boys continue up.  He smiles at the toddler, 
           chucks its chin.  Distracted, it stops crying.  To her:

                        Vamanos, Abuelita...

           She does as she’s told.  As she disappears through the 3rd 
           floor fire door, Roman follows the boys up to the...

           4TH FLOOR HALLWAY

           Dockery points at the THIRD DOOR down.

                        Whose turn on point?

           Hardwick raises his hand.  Roman nods as they take up 
           positions on either side of door number three.  

           Dockery aims his shotgun at the door lock and knob.

           Hardwick crouches low like he’s in the starting blocks.  
           Metcalf lined up to follow behind him.

           Roman counts down from three with his fingers.  At ‘one’ --

           BOOM!  Dockery blows a 16-inch hole in the door and frame 
           where the lock now used to be.

           Hardwick barrels through --

           4TH FLOOR GRAND VIEW APARTMENT

           Hardwick’s head on a swivel.  No one in the darkened room.  
           The sound of La Raza 97.9 coming out of the kitchen ahead.  A 
           light on in there.   It’s about now...

           Hardwick realizes he’s entered the room without any back up.

           4TH FLOOR HALLWAY

           Shotguns racked, but no one has moved an inch to follow.

           4TH FLOOR GRAND VIEW APARTMENT

           Hardwick looks back over his shoulder, realizes he’s alone.

                                 HARDWICK
                        Oh shit...

           A SHAPE emerges from alongside a high WALL HUTCH.  Pistol 
           aimed at the back of Hardwick’s head - above his vest.

           BLAM!  Hardwick is put down like a dog.  
           The man (WOODY) holding the gun is as far from Honduran as 
           you can get.  Caucasian, head-shaved with a goatee.  In a 
           tank top and leather motorcycle pants: a real one percenter.  
           He hovers over Hardwick a beat before, over his shoulder:

                                 WOODY
                        Your boy’s down.

                        You got three coming in.

           Roman leads the way.  Dockery and Metcalf follow.  As they 
           lower their shotguns to at ease, Woody gestures to Hardwick.

                                 WOODY 
                        He’s like Buddha now.  Don’t want 
                        nothing.  Don’t need nothing.

           Roman kneels for a closer look.  Hardwick is very dead.

                        You don’t mess around, do you,

                        Buddha, I need to get paid so...

           Roman stands, hands over a thick wad of crisp $100 BILLS.

           As Woody laughs... CHA-CHUCK.  He turns to see Metcalf point 
           his shotgun.  He has time to think ‘oh shit’, but not say it.

           BOOM! -- Woody flies -- Dead before he hits the ground.

           Dockery crouches to retrieve the cash from Woody’s waist.

           He pulls out his own camouflage neoprene mask from his 
           pocket, tosses it on the sofa.  Looks to Metcalf, winks.

           Dockery and Metcalf exit.  We hear them call “POLICÍA!” as 
           Roman considers Hardwick.  Sitting down by the body, Roman 
           takes the mic for the police radio off his shoulder.

                        South Grand Street.  Fifth floor.

           He actually sounds distressed.  He sets a hand on Hardwick’s 
           chest almost like he’s steadying himself.  As he does...

           Woody’s pistol raises shakily.  Fuck, he ain’t dead.  Roman 
           blinks, staring down the barrel.  We rack past to Woody, 
           blood spills from his lips as he tries to say something.

           Woody’s hand shaking worse; the pistol spills out of it.  
           Roman kicks it away, scoots back, but Woody is dead at last.

           LITTLE STUFFED ANIMALS

           About twenty of them, stuffed between the windshield and the 
           dashboard of a car.  Over it we hear the sounds of a couple 
           making out.  Sounds serious.  And we’re on --

           ECHO PARK BOULEVARD - SUNSET 

           Down the street from the halfway house.  Luna and his girl 
           from the bus stop, Penelope, make out, leaned up against the 
           side of her FORD FIESTA.  Hot and heavy for a city street.  
           The stuffed animals bear witness.  Finally:

                                 PENELOPE
                        I gotta go, baby.  I’m gonna be 
                        late for work.

           He looks at her, really flipped for her.

                                 LUNA
                        Someday, there ain’t gonna be no 
                        late.  Not for us.

           They kiss again, softer now.  Then become aware of Grimes 
           coming down the street.  His eyes on them.  As Luna grins.

                        Hey, meet my friend.  Except he’s 
                        not my friend, right?  Sidney, this 
                        is Penelope.

           Grimes stops, considers her a beat before.

           As she put out her hand --  An aborted SIREN WHOOP, cherry 
           lights flashing as a police UNMARKED pulls up.

                        That’s wrong.  Mr. Grimes did get 
                        something in return.  He got to

                        I had a strong case.  The jury most 
                        likely would have convicted.  But 
                        you never know with a jury.  At the 
                        end, Grimes copped a deal: guilty 
                        plea for Victorville.  His wife was 
                        dying.  Cancer I think.  He was 
                        afraid he’d end up in federal 
                        prison in South Carolina, Oklahoma, 
                        somewhere out of state.  That sick, 
                        his wife might not make it to visit 
                        him.  So he pled guilty.

           long illness.  Donations to the American Cancer Society.  
           Survived by a husband Sidney.

           Bell studies Carly’s photo.  A strange moment until -- 

           The door opens: Fowler standing there with a very serious 
           look on his face.

                                 BELL
                        What happened?

                                 FOWLER
                        John Hardwick is dead.

                                 BELL
                        Line of duty?
           Bell picks up a surveillance photo: Roman & Hardwick.

                                 FOWLER
                        Yeah, SIS followed an armed robbery 
                        suspect to an apartment building.  
                        Suspect shot Hardwick as they 
                        attempted to arrest him.

                                 BELL
                        And the suspect?

                                 FOWLER
                        Dead.  No witnesses except for 
                        those involved.  

           As she thinks about this a beat.

                                 FOWLER (CONT’D)
                        There’s something else going on.

                                 BELL
                        I’m listening.

                                 FOWLER
                        Phelps brought Grimes in again.  

                                 BELL
                        For what?

                                 FOWLER
                        Don’t know, but he’s got him down 
                        in line-up even as we speak.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           SIDNEY GRIMES - POLICE LINE-UP ROOM

           Standing with THREE OTHER MEN.  Grimes stands in the three 
           spot.  As the men look generally toward the one way glass.

           LINE-UP OBSERVATION ROOM

           Detective Phelps in here with the young Dad from Eagle Rock.  
           The one who bought Grimes’ house.  He points at Grimes.

                                 DAD
                        Number three.

                                 DETECTIVE PHELPS
                        You sure?

                                 DAD
                        Absolutely.  Look, what did this 
                        guy do?
           The nervous Dad ‘jumps’ as the door opens and Bell and Fowler 
           enter.  As Phelps looks over...

                                 FOWLER
                        Can we talk to you?

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - FIRST STREET LAPD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Bell, Fowler and Phelps in an intense, but low discussion.

                                 PHELPS
                        I had my team scour all arrest and 
                        incident reports from the time 
                        Grimes was released until Childress 
                        was shot.  I got a young kid on my 
                        team - he’ll make lieutenant before 
                        I ever do - 

                                 FOWLER
                        Get in line.

                                 PHELPS
                        My witness inside filed a report 
                        about a strange man in his house.  
                        Kid on my team matched the address 
                        to the address of Grimes’ old 
                        house.  Witness just IDed Grimes.

                                 BELL
                        Are you saying Grimes went to his 
                        old house before...

                                 PHELPS
                        Before he killed Childress, yeah.  
                        Apparently he went up in the attic, 
                        came back down and left.

                                 FOWLER
                        Did he take anything?

                                 PHELPS
                        Witness doesn’t know.  I say, he 
                        had a gun stashed up there.  Gun 
                        that killed Childress.

                                 BELL
                        What are you gonna do?

                                 PHELPS
                        I’m gonna hold him and sweat him.
                                 BELL
                        Let’s work together on this.  
                        Grimes is the key to something 
                        bigger than Childress.

                                 PHELPS
                        Not to me, he’s not.

           The door opens.  The young Dad steps out.

                                 DAD
                        Can I go now?

                                 PHELPS
                        Please step back inside, sir.

           As he starts to shrink back in --

                                 BELL
                        Excuse me.  This man, did he force 
                        his way in your house.

                                 DAD
                        Actually, I invited him in, but...

                                 BELL
                               (to Phelps)
                        You got nothing.  Work with us and 
                        we’ll share everything.  We’ll get 
                        you Grimes.

                                 DETECTIVE PHELPS
                        And what do I gotta do?

           Before they can answer...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. OFFICE - FIRST STREET LAPD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Grimes sits across the desk from Bell.

                                 BELL
                        What’s Roman been up to?

                                 GRIMES
                        Nothing.  He says he wants me to 
                        work for him; he hasn’t said doing 
                        what.

                                 BELL
                        That’s it?

                                 GRIMES
                        That’s it.
                                 BELL
                        Well, he’s got that custom car 
                        place.  Maybe he’s going to put 
                        your car washing skills to use.

           He doesn’t answer, does not come close to rising to the bait.  
           She holds up a file: Grimes, Sidney. 

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        Your old service file.  You used to 
                        be quite a hotshot cop.

                                 GRIMES
                        Used to be.  A lot of used to be’s.

                                 BELL
                        Were you a dirty cop?

                                 GRIMES
                        That’s what everyone said.

                                 BELL
                        You, too.  You pled guilty.

           Grimes shrugs, isn’t going to defend himself.  She knows 
           better though.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        We’re never going to be on the same 
                        side.  Even so, I’m sorry about the 
                        other day.  Your wife’s photo.

           Grimes shrugs, no big deal.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        You have it on you?  Can I see it?

           Grimes carefully removes the two pieces from his wallet.  
           It’s still torn in two.  Bell grabs a roll of scotch tape.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        May I?

                                 GRIMES
                        You don’t have to.

                                 BELL
                        Oh, believe me.

           He gives them up reluctantly.  She sets the two halves of 
           Carly’s photo on the desk, works them together.

                                 GRIMES
                        She kind of makes more sense to me 
                        torn in two.
                                 BELL
                        Shut up.

           He watches as she sets the pieces back side down.  Lines them 
           up, tape them together.  The tear barely noticeable.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        If you put tape on this side, it 
                        won’t look as good.

                                 GRIMES
                        I agree.  Thanks.

           She studies Carly a beat, hands her back over, sits.

                                 BELL
                        Would you mind telling me something 
                        about her?

           He doesn’t answer at first, carefully returns the photo to 
           his wallet, his wallet to his pocket.  Then...

                                 GRIMES
                        She was how I knew which way north 
                        was.  Once you know that, 
                        everything else falls into place.

           Bell wonders at such sweet words from a not so sweet man.

                                 BELL
                        I’ll take your word for it.  The 
                        men I meet all point south.

                                 GRIMES
                        Maybe that’s what you want.

                                 BELL
                        Maybe...  You know, Grimes, you 
                        don’t seem to me like a guy who 
                        cares if he goes back to jail.  
                        Should I be worried?

           Grimes assumes it’s a rhetorical question.  It might as well 
           be a ‘yes’.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        Let me know when Roman gives you 
                        your job description.

           She steps over, opens up the door.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        You’re free to go.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           EXT. FIRST STREET LAPD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           The front doors open and Grimes exits.  A free man.  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           SIDNEY GRIMES - IN HIS ROOM

           Seen from above as he pistons himself up and down in the 
           moonlight.  No rest for the weary, the wicked or Sidney 
           Grimes.   As we descend on the screwdriver punch-hole scars:

                                 CARLY’S VOICE
                        Sometimes I think about you out 
                        there.  What you’ll be like after I 
                        go.  

           SIDNEY - HIS BED

           As he drops back in a sweat.  

                                 CARLY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        And you’re alone.  So quiet.  

           For the last time, someone gets in bed beside him.  Her.  
           Again, he doesn’t react and we only see edges.

                                 CARLY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Still believing in me...  How long 
                        can one heart go, Mr Blue?  How 
                        long can you look for me after I’m 
                        gone?  When it’s only parts of me?  

           His despair absolute, Grimes closes his eyes.

                                 CARLY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        If I were you I’d start over.  No 
                        matter how it hurts.  Cuz hurting’s 
                        just being afraid.  That’s what I’d 
                        do, Mr. Blue.  I’d get on a jet 
                        plane.  Just buy a ticket.  

           Grimes doesn’t see the pale hand reach over --

                                 CARLY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        It don’t matter where. 

           As the fingers brush the scars on his side --

           Grimes sits up.  Of course, he’s alone.  And he shifts an odd 
           emotional beat: the despair turning to something darker.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. BEDROOM - SOUTH CENTRAL CLAPBOARD - NIGHT

           Burgess in a wife beater, roused out of his slumber by the 
           incessant BARKING of the PITBULLS outside.  Shit...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. PORCH - SOUTH CENTRAL CLAPBOARD - NIGHT

           Burgess rumbles out the front door carrying a SAUCEPAN full 
           of water.  He leans over the side flings it on the dogs.  As 
           they quiet, he sets the sauce pan on the rail.

           Burgess gets out a pack of smokes, pops a cigarette in his 
           mouth.  As he strikes a match, he hears a creak on the porch 
           behind him, turns to find...

           Grimes -- Aiming the 9MM that killed Childress at him.

                                 GRIMES
                               (re: match)
                        Don’t let me hold you up.

           Burgess finishes lighting up.  He takes a puff, exhales.

                                 BURGESS
                        What do you want?

                                 GRIMES
                        I don’t think you told me 
                        everything.

                                 BURGESS
                        Yeah?  News to me.

                                 GRIMES
                        Tell me the story again.

                                 BURGESS
                               (re: sofa)
                        Mind if I sit?

           Grimes shakes his head, doesn’t mind.  As Burgess sits, his 
           hand goes between the cushions (shielded by his body).

                                 GRIMES
                        It’s not there.

           Grimes lifts his shirt.  The .38 seen earlier between the 
           cushion is stuck in his waistband.  Burgess smiles wistfully.

                                 BURGESS
                        What story was it you want to hear?

           INT. KITCHEN - SOUTH CENTRAL CLAPBOARD - NIGHT

           The 18-year-old Kid who drew on Grimes earlier opens the 
           fridge, bathed in light as he scans, pulls out a coke.  He 
           looks like he just woke up, too.

           He pops it, has a sip, before he becomes aware of VOICES 
           outside.  MOVE WITH him as he walks into...

           THE LIVING ROOM

           Sees though the window where Grimes points a gun at Burgess 
           and BOOM! -- Shoots him dead.

           MOVE WITH the kid as he dashes into a SECOND BEDROOM, 
           retrieves his GUN from a dresser.  Then moving again as he 
           charges back out, hits the --

           Gun raised.  Burgess sits dead, Grimes nowhere in sight...

           There’s Grimes walking home with a bag of groceries.

           STREET

           Grimes walking toward the halfway house.  He turns as:

           INT. GRIMES’ ROOM - DAY

           Grimes gets down on the floor.  He sets himself, palms down, 
           ready to start some push-ups when --

           VOICES in the hall, shouts in Spanish.  Over it all Luna’s: 
           Mutherfucker!  BOOM!  A slam against the wall.  Grimes moves 
           for the door, open it to find...

           THE HALLWAY

           Castro’s gangbangers from the Lexus tangle with Luna.  
           CASTILLO has Luna by the throat, POMPEO tries to tie up his 
           arms as Luna throws punches back at them.  As two heavy shots 
           to the gut quiet Luna down...

                                 GRIMES
                        Get off him.

           As Grimes takes a step forward, he finds Castillo’s 9MM 
           raised and an inch from his face.  

           Blood runs from Castillo’s nose.  Crazy-eyed, he seems a 
           breath away from blowing Grimes’ head off.

           Pompeo leans over Luna who has slid down to the floor.

                                 POMPEO
                        You got the message?

           Luna doesn’t answer.  Pompeo cuffs his ear.
                                 LUNA
                        Simon.  I got it.

           Pompeo heads out, walks right past Grimes whose eyes never 
           leave those of Castillo.  Finally, Castillo 180’s around 
           Grimes, the 9MM aimed at his face the whole time.  When he’s 
           on the other side, he follows his compatriot.  As they go...

           Luna sits, his head in his hands, trying not to cry.  Grimes 
           looks unsure.  Like he’s probably done all he can and should 
           just leave him there.  As an afterthought...

                                 GRIMES
                        You okay?

                                 LUNA
                        What the fuck do you care, man?

           Luna pulls out his wallet.  Grimes starts for his own door.  
           Glancing back, he sees Luna pull out a PHOTO of his girl: 
           Penelope.  Like the one Grimes carries of Carly.  

           Grimes’ world slips a little off its axis.

                                 GRIMES
                        Hey...

           Luna looks over, wipes his snotty nose at the same time.

                                 GRIMES (CONT’D)
                        They do something to your girl?

                                 LUNA
                        They took her, man.  They fucking 
                        took her.  They said I could join 
                        back up with them if I want her.

           Grimes looks at him, really measuring him.

                                 GRIMES
                        Beats the car wash.

                                 LUNA
                               (shakes his head)
                        Fuck that gangbang shit.  ‘Sides I 
                        crossed the line.  You don’t know 
                        these guys, man.  They’ll fuck her 
                        sideways just cuz I took too long 
                        to come around, you know?

           Luna shoves his wallet and photo in his pocket, lurches to 
           his feet.  As he starts past, Grimes blocks him.

                                 GRIMES
                        Where are you going?
                                 LUNA
                        I’m gonna get a gun, man.  I’m 
                        gonna go get my girl.  Or fucking 
                        die trying.

           They regard each other.  Whatever test of character that 
           exists in Sidney Grimes’ mind... Luna just passed it.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Grimes walking down with purpose.  Luna a bit behind, a bit 
           confused, not to mention urgent for action.

                                 LUNA
                        What the fuck are we doing here?  
                        We gonna go get her with a fucking 
                        socket wrench --

           Grimes pulls out the hose coil, retrieves his 9 MM.

                                 LUNA (CONT’D)
                        Oh...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. 7TH STREET - DAY

           A Ford Fiesta pulls to the curb at the southeast corner.  The 
           dashboard stuffed animals still there as Grimes and Luna look 
           across at PASEO CHAPIN, a Guatemalan restaurant.  A familiar 
           tricked out Lexus is parked in front.  After a long moment:

                                 GRIMES
                        Give me the picture.

           Luna reaches in his wallet, hands him the photo of Penelope.  
           Grimes scary right now.  He slides it into his shirt pocket.

                                 GRIMES (CONT’D)
                        You sure you can handle yourself?

                        Just because I wanna get out of the 
                        gang don’t mean I didn’t know what 
                        I was doing when I was in it. 

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. PASEO CHAPIN - DAY

           Marimba music plays as Castro eats.  He’s eating alone at a 
           table for two, chewing as he listens to Castillo and Pompeo 
           (standing over him) tell him how it went down with Luna.
           Suddenly he’s looking past them...

                                 CASTRO
                        Trucha.

           They turn, see what Castro sees: Luna has come through the 
           front door and is headed toward them.  Their hands all go to 
           where their guns are, but they don’t show them.

                                 CASTRO (CONT’D)
                        Que ‘onda, Luna?

                                 LUNA
                        Not much.  Just came to get my old 
                        lady back from wherever you stashed 
                        her, huh?

           Castro smiles, nods to Castillo who does a subtle PAT-DOWN of 
           Luna (considering they’re in a restaurant and all.)

                                 CASTRO
                        Does that mean we can count on you?  
                        That you understand your co-mit-
                        ment?
                               (Luna nods)
                        Wish it was up to me.  I love you, 
                        man.  But you gotta talk to Villa.  
                        He’s got her.  That’s where she is.

                                 LUNA
                        Let’s go then.

           Castro holds up a forkful of Mole de plantanos.

                                 CASTRO
                        You want some banana?

           Luna shakes his head, doesn’t.  Castro eats it instead.

                                 CASTRO (CONT’D)
                        Hmmm.  Fucking Guatemalans got 
                        their shit down, wey.

           Sucking something off one tooth, Castro stands, drops some 
           money on the table.  As they all head out...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Watching from the Fiesta as they exit.  Castro, Castillo and 
           Luna pile into the Lexus as Pompeo continues away on foot.  
           As the Lexus pulls away, Grimes follows a few cars back.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. SWEAT SHOP OFFICE - DAY

           Behind a desk, VILLA leans back in his WHEELCHAIR, hands 
           crossed over his forehead.  His legs useless, strapped in, a 
           permanent condition.  A gold Rolex on one wrist, platinum on 
           the other.  Tattooed across one forearm: Perdóname Mi Madre.  
           The other: Hasta La Meurte.

           Through the glass behind him: the WORK FLOOR.  Honduran, 
           Salvadoran and Guatemalan WOMEN run 1000’s of yards of 
           material through a 100 industrial SEWING MACHINES.

                                 VILLA
                        I’m talking about weight, Carnal.  
                        And you bring a fucking briefcase?  
                        You understand what weight means?

           Villa stares across at a WHITE GUY in a very sharp suit.  
           He’s got a second SHARP SUITED boy with him.  Villa’s got 
           JUMBO with him.  Guy must weigh 300 pounds.  Who knew 
           Dickie’s made an Eisenhower jacket this big?

                                 WHITE GUY
                        Mr. Villa, if you’d listen to me --

           An aluminum BRIEFCASE sits on the desk.

                                 VILLA
                        Listen to you?!  Any fucking 
                        closer, Bolillo, I'd be inside your 
                        motherfucking mouth!
                               (a tense beat  )
                        So tell me.  I’m all ears.

                                 WHITE GUY
                               (grabs case)
                        This is just the first installment.

           He pops it open.  It’s packed with banded $100 BILLS.

                                 WHITE GUY (CONT’D)
                        After that we’d like to make this 
                        run once a week.  That’s how we say 
                        weight where I come from. 

           Villa grins like the devil.  The white guy and sharp suit 
           grin back.  But Jumbo doesn’t know what a smile is.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. SAN PEDRO STREET - DOWNTOWN LA - DAY

           Industrial.  A lot of hard work going on around here.  The 
           tricked out Lexus turns off the street, stops in front of a 
           roll up steel door.  As Castro leans on his horn --
           -- Grimes’ drives past in the Fiesta, pulls to the curb, 
           parks in front of the two other cars parked ahead.  

           LEXUS

           Luna clocks Grimes ever so subtly.  Castro leans forward, 
           looks up at the surveillance camera above the roll up.

                                 CASTRO
                               (waves)
                        Come on, mutherfucker.

           As the door starts to roll up.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. SWEAT SHOP - DAY

           The Lexus rolls in from the street, stops alongside racks of 
           CLOTHES ON HANGARS waiting for the trucks.  All those sewing 
           machines make a lot of noise.   As Castro, Luna and Castillo 
           pile out, they are met by GYPSY.

                                 GYPSY
                        Hey, Castro...
                               (spots Luna)
                        Oh shit!

           Luna just gives him a flat dead eye.

                                 CASTRO
                        Is he here?

                                 GYPSY
                        In his office.

           Luna follows Castro’s gaze over to where the office sits in 
           the corner.  We see Villa and the boys through the glass. 

           Gypsy slaps a button on the wall.  The garage door starts to 
           roll back down.  Gypsy watches Luna’s back as he heads toward 
           the office flanked by Castro and Castillo.

                                 GYPSY (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t wanna be you, man.

           As Gypsy starts back to wherever he came from, we let him go 
           because we’re too focused on Grimes as he ROLLS IN under the 
           door just before it hits the floor.

           He rolls to a crouch, moves along using the Lexus as a 
           shield.  He looks through the window, spots Luna on his way, 
           then shifts to track Gypsy who is headed through the racks.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           GYPSY - AMIDST THE RACKS

           Seen from behind and we’re closing quick...

                                 VOICE
                        Hey...

           Gypsy turns to find the barrel of the 9MM placed against his 
           forehead.  Grimes at the other end.  Gypsy is slackjawed, not 
           to mention cross-eyed as he focuses on the gun.

           Grimes pats him down, relieves him of a GLOCK.  Shoving the 
           spare gun in his belt, Grimes then reaches in his pocket, 
           holds up Penelope’s photo.  He whispers:

                                 GRIMES
                        Where?

           Gypsy’s eyes go from it, to the gun, then to Grimes.  As 
           Grimes cocks back the hammer.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. SWEAT SHOP OFFICE - DAY

           Where four heavy bags of COCAINE have been set on the table.  
           White Guy has scooped out two even measuring spoonfuls from a 
           5th.  As he pours METHANOL into one...

           The door opens and Castro leads in Luna followed by Castillo.  
           Villa grins as he clocks Luna.  And as he steps up...

                                 VILLA
                        Hola, Luna.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           GRIMES 

           Frog marches Gypsy to a door in the back.  A key dangles from 
           a lock.  Gypsy turns it, opens it to reveal...

           PENELOPE.  Sitting on the floor of a broom closet.  Wrists 
           tied, her left eye is black, her arms bruised.  But all in 
           all, she’s very much alive.

           Grimes blinks.  Then brings the gun down once very hard.  As 
           Gypsy drops, Grimes follows him, brings the gun down twice 
           even harder.  As Penelope starts to her feet...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           CLOTHES RACKS

           Not far from the roll up door.  Grimes leading Penelope, 
           stops in the midst of the garments.  A good place to hide.
                                 GRIMES
                        Stay here till we come get you.  
                        Got it?

           She nods, a mixture of terrified and hopeful.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. SWEATSHOP OFFICE - DAY

           Whatever happened in those test spoons has the White Guy very 
           excited.  As Sharp Suits loads the cocaine blocks into a 
           black Ralph’s recyclable grocery BAG...

                                 VILLA
                        Once you step on it, you’re gonna 
                        be a rich white mutherfucker.

                                 WHITE GUY
                        I already am... a rich white 
                        mutherfucker.

                                 VILLA
                        Right.  You wanna stick around?  
                        We’re gonna have a party.

           He pounds a fist on one of his useless legs.

                                 VILLA (CONT’D)
                        Fucking weird, I can still get it 
                        up, but I don’t feel it when I cum.  
                               (to Luna)
                        When we bring your ruca in here, 
                        you know what I’m gonna do to her?

           Luna moves at him.  He’s grabbed by Castro and Castillo.

           Sewing machines suddenly loud as the door bangs open:  A 
           FLOOR RUNNER stands in the doorway obscured by the big PILE 
           OF CLOTHES he carries.

                                 VILLA (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?  Get that shit out 
                        of here.

           The clothes hit the ground at the runner’s feet revealing 
           Grimes: the 9MM he used to kill Childress in his right hand, 
           the Glock in his left. One against six, but no one else has a 
           gun out yet.  

           (Castillo, Luna and Castro are to Grimes’ right.  White Guy 
           and Sharp Suit are to his left.  Villa and Jumbo face him.)

                                 VILLA (CONT’D)
                        Who the fuck are you?
           Grimes looks at Castro.

                                 GRIMES
                               (re: Luna)
                        Let him go.

           No one makes a move to obey.  After a beat...

           Grimes SHOOTS Castro in the leg.  He goes down howling.

           Everyone starts to move for their guns, but no one quite gets 
           there as Grimes takes a step forward, the 9MM aimed straight 
           at Villa while sweeping the room with the Glock.

           Luna jerks away from Castillo.  He slides over, takes the 
           Glock from Grimes.  

                                 LUNA
                        She okay?

           Grimes nods.  Luna looks to Villa.

                                 LUNA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.  You.  

           Villa’s hand creeps to the SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN in his lap.

                                 VILLA
                        I’m here, Luna.  Nothing between us 
                        but air.

           That’s when Sharp Suit suddenly draws and things go haywire.

           Grimes shoots Sharp Suit even as --

           Luna and Castillo fire at each other.  Castillo down.

           Villa brings up the shotgun.  Sawed off, but the end still 
           catches the lip of his desk -- BOOM!  The front of the desk 
           blows out right between Grimes and Luna.

           Grimes exchanging FIRE with White Guy who goes down.

           Jumbo rushing forward.  BANG! BANG!  Luna fires two point 
           blank rounds before Jumbo slams into him and they both smash 
           through the cheap sheetrock wall.

           Villa has the double barrel aimed high on Grimes, has him 
           dead to rights.  As Villa smiles and the trigger starts in ---

           -- Grimes collapses himself to the floor -- BOOM! -- the 
           pellets blow through the glass behind where Grimes once was.

           On the floor, Grimes finds himself staring through the hole 
           in the desk at Villa’s chest.  BANG!  BANG!  Hit in the 
           chest, the impact rolls Villa back until he hits the wall. 
           LUNA - SWEAT SHOP FLOOR

           Extricating himself from under Jumbo’s dead body.  Women on 
           the floor screaming, abandoning their sewing machines.  As 
           Luna stands, a young GANGBANGER is running up from somewhere 
           else.  Luna raises the Glock.  Young blood turns and runs.

           THE OFFICE

           Grimes kicks wounded Castro’s gun from his outstretched hand, 
           he steps to the desk.  Closing the lid on the briefcase full 
           of CASH, he tosses it to Luna as Luna reenters.  

           Grimes picks up the sawed off, shoves it in the Ralph’s bag 
           with the cocaine.  Grimes carries that.  Spotting CAR KEYS 
           spilled out of Sharp Suit’s pocket, he scoops them.

                                 GRIMES
                        Let’s go.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. SWEAT SHOP FLOOR - DAY

           Grimes and Luna do a double-time trot, head into...

           THE CLOTHES RACKS

           ...And Penelope.  As she whips her arms around Luna’s neck --

                                                                  CUT TO:

           The metal door rolls up.  Grimes, Luna and Penelope exit.  
           Frantic sweat shop girls are filling the street further down.  

           Grimes leads the way to the Fiesta.

                                 GRIMES
                        Get as far from L.A. as you can.

                               (hefts briefcase)
                        What about this?

           Penelope’s already getting in on the passenger side.

                                 GRIMES
                        See how far it’ll take you.
                               (re: Ralph’s bag)
                        I keep this.

           Luna looks at his new best friend.  May never see him again.
                                 LUNA
                        I’m gonna send you a postcard.  
                        You’re gonna be proud.  I promise.  
                        This is a good thing you done.  

           Grimes waves him off, doesn’t want to hear it.

                                 GRIMES
                        I used to think words were 
                        important.  But they’re bullshit.  
                        The only thing that matters is what 
                        a person does.

           Luna gets in.  Rolls down the window even as he starts it.

                                 LUNA
                        All the same I’m telling you, I’m 
                        gonna find a way to get that 
                        fucking cap and gown.

                                 GRIMES
                        You do, I’ll come watch you 
                        graduate.  

           Time to go.  They both regard him: she all beat-up, he 
           covered with sheet rock dust.  He regards them back.

                                 GRIMES (CONT’D)
                        Get the hell out of here. 

           Luna nods.  Grimes scoots back as they tear off.  He watches 
           after them a beat, then holds up the car key he took off 
           Sharp Suit, presses down on the remote.  

           Across the street a BMW 5 series CHIRPS, flashes its lights.  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Roman stand at attention around Hardwick’s flag draped COFFIN 
           as a BUGLER finishes ‘Taps’.

           Watches.  In her POLICE UNIFORM as well, standing in the 
           front row of a throng of LAPD who have shown up.

           GRAVESIDE

           Dockery and Metcalf fold the American flag.  Hand it to Roman 
           who walks it over to a woman dressed in black.  
           She is HARDWICK’S WIDOW.  She stands with TWO CHILDREN (6 & 
           8) a little apart from the other family mourners.  As Roman 
           exchanges condolences with her we can’t hear them until... 

           WE CUT IN BETWEEN THEM

           Mrs. Hardwick taking the flag, head bowed.

                                 MRS. HARDWICK
                               (very softly)
                        I need that money, Roman.
                               (looks up)
                        I need Johnny’s share.

           Roman smiles sadly.  You’d never know what the conversation 
           is unless you were standing right with them.

                                 ROMAN
                        We’ll talk about this later, okay?

                                 MRS. HARDWICK
                        Tonight.

           He embraces her in an apparently sympathetic hug.

                                 ROMAN
                               (into her ear)
                        What time will the kids be in bed?

                                 MRS. HARDWICK
                               (into his)
                        Nine-thirty...  And Roman, God help 
                        you if you don’t make me cum.

           He takes a step back, rests his hands on her shoulders.  A 
           squeeze of reassurance and support.

                                 ROMAN
                               (louder)
                        You can count on me.

           BELL 

           Watches as Roman returns to Dockery and Metcalf.  Arriving 
           from somewhere else, Fowler slides up alongside her.  They 
           lean forward, speak low as a SOLOIST sings Amazing Grace.

                                 FOWLER
                        They just named Hardwick’s killer 
                        as a suspect in the Glendale B of A 
                        robbery last week.  Bank manager 
                        IDed the mask found at the scene.

           As Bell considers the implications...
                                 FOWLER (CONT’D)
                        They recovered fifteen thousand 
                        dollars.  Serial numbers line up 
                        with B of A’s.  That leaves 175,000 
                        still outstanding.

           Bell’s eyes glued to Roman as she jumps to a conclusion.

                                 BELL
                        You thinking what I’m thinking?  
                        There’s dirty and then there’s 
                        filthy.

                                 FOWLER
                        SIS isn’t exactly a desk job.  It 
                        could’ve happened like they said.

           As Roman feels her eyes on him....

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. FOREST LAWN PARKING LOT - DAY

           Leaving, Roman, Metcalf and Dockery receive sympathetic pats 
           on the back, embraces from some of the rank and file.  
           Finally they extricate themselves and start across the lot.  
           MOVE WITH them as they’re followed by many sympathetic eyes. 

                                 DOCKERY
                        This day can’t end soon enough.

           And then someone angles in.  To their left and just ahead of 
           them.  Bell.  As she walks, looking ahead, not at them:

                                 BELL
                        Know what I love about being a cop?  
                        The deck is stacked.  A criminal 
                        has to get away with every crime 
                        they commit.  But the cops, we only 
                        have to catch them once.  I’ll take 
                        those odds every time.
                               (turns on them.)
                        Did Hardwick’s habit finally catch 
                        up with him?

           Roman stops.  Dockery and Metcalf exchange looks. 

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        That’s the rumor.  I mean, that he 
                        was having some problems.
                               (to Metcalf)
                        What’s Roman going to do, Metcalf?  
                        When you start drinking too much?

                        I’ll catch up.

           As they head off, Roman steps back to face her.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)

           DOCKERY & METCALF

           By the Escalade, watching Bell head off as Roman approaches.

           Grimes stands before the PATIENT OWNER, a 60-year old woman.  
           She listens as he tries to approximate a tune.  The WALT 
           DISNEY CONCERT HALL can be seen through the store window.

                                 GRIMES
                        Baa-baa-ba-ba-ba-baaa-ba... Ba-ba --

           She recognizes, starts singing the same song in rich SOPRANO:

                                 PATIENT OWNER
                        O mio babbino caro...

           The most excited we’ve ever seen him, Grimes starts jabbing 
           his finger in the air.

                                 GRIMES
                        That’s it!  That’s it!

           The owner very pleased with herself.

           INT. BMW - PARKED ON GRAND AVENUE - DAY

           Grimes sitting in the parked BMW.  His finger presses the CD 
           into the player.  He clicks forward to track 8.  The LED 
           screen IDs it as: 08 O Mio Babbino Caro.  Time lengthens; and 
           out of the ambient silence:

                                 DAME KIRI TE KANAWA
                        O mio babbino caro...

           So beautiful.  So loaded.  He’s been waiting ten years for 
           this moment, ten years to hear this transporting music.  And 
           it fills the car, takes him away.  His eyes well.  Grimes 
           squeezes them shut.  And tears trickle down, more in 
           deliverance than despair.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Grimes turns the corner, the Ralph’s bag in hand.  Coast 
           clear, he pulls out the garden hose, slides the Ralph’s bag 
           as far back as it will go.  Then the 9MM.  Then Luna’s 
           shotgun.  As he shoves the hose coil back in front...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Fowler drives.  Bell beside him.  They follow: a CADILLAC 
           ESCALADE a few cars ahead.  It changes lanes to the inside.  
           Fowler also changes lanes, keeping another car between them.
           Fowler sets an elbow on the wheel to tear open an ALMOND JOY.

                                 FOWLER

                        That was good stuff.  Scooter pie 
                        and a coke, you could run all day.

           He offers 1/2 his Almond Joy.  As she shakes her head...  The 
           Escalade pulls to the curb where Grimes waits.

           They continue past as Grimes get inside --

           THE ESCALADE

           Roman behind the wheel.  He’s pulling away as the door shuts.

           CHEVY CAPRICE

           Pulled to the curb.  Fowler lets the Escalade leapfrog them 
           before pulling out to follow.  Over their car SPEAKERS...

           Headed east in the slow lane, traffic bunching for the red 
           light at Silver Lake Boulevard.  Roman checks his REARVIEW.

           Roman guns it.  As they launch at the rear end of the car in 
           front of them -- Roman whips left across the outside lane 
           just ahead of a car that was alongside him a moment ago.

           CHEVY CAPRICE

           Braking for traffic, caught off guard as Roman whips a U-turn 
           into oncoming traffic.  As cars swerve around the Escalade 
           and it then takes off with them --  Fowler moves to follow -- 
           His front fender clipped by the car alongside him.  It stops, 
           blocking him.  Bell hits the HORN.

           ROMAN

           Grinning as he watches in his REARVIEW.  Looking ahead an 
           instant before he turn a BLISTERING LEFT.  Grimes hangs on.

           CAPRICE

           Bell watches over her shoulder as they disappear.  She pounds 
           her fist on the dash.  Then...

           THE ESCALADE

           Roman reaches up, tears back a corner of the car’s roof 
           panel.  He tears loose a WIRE, a MINI-MIC at the end of it.

           Roman opens the window, feeds it to the wind and as they lean 
           into another hard, rubber-ripping turn --

                        Mayan motherfuckers are hold up 
                        there.  Pineda and Caliez.

           Roman trades a long look with Grimes who has no idea this is 
           much the same spiel Hardwick heard before he died.

           Roman grins, raises his glass.  He sets it down empty.  He 
           looks to the bar.  The place is crowded.

           EXT. CLUB LOUNGE - RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - NIGHT

           The 23rd floor bar.  All that shit below looks like a 
           Christmas Tree from up here.  Bell sits at the bar.  Staring 
           out the window, absentmindedly clicking her fingernails on a 
           glass of red wine.  Looking like some exiled, isolated Queen.  

           Until... The BARTENDER steps over, sets an amber-filled SHOT 
           GLASS down in front of her.
                                 BARTENDER
                        From the gentleman.  He thought you 
                        might need something stronger.

           As the bartender backs away, Bell looks over to a LONE MAN 
           across the way.  Subtly handsome, not lacking in bravado, he 
           raises his own shot glass in greeting.

           Bell considers him.  Inscrutable.  Only she knows what she’s 
           thinking: only she knows where the future lies.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. KUSTOM - NORTH HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           Closed for the night.  But SOMEONE CLIMBS the chain link 
           fence the surrounds the little car lot.  Seen in silhouette 
           as they arc a piece of old over the concertina wire on the 
           top.  Slithering over, dropping to the ground on the inside.

           It’s Grimes.  He walks over to the garage wall, where a box 
           is mounted.  He hits a button and the fence gate begins to 
           roll back.  Move with Grimes as he exits to where...

           The BMW he stole idles.  Grimes gets in.  As he drives into 
           the lot and we wonder what the Hell he’s up to...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. HALFWAY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Grimes walking home.  It is late.  As he heads up the steps, 
           he’s watched from...

           THE DARK SIDE OF THE STREET

           A CAR parked there.  Young Blood from Villa’s sweat shop 
           behind the wheel.  Another GANGBANGER beside him.  Castro 
           holed-up in the back seat.  As they trade deadly looks.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - HALFWAY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dead quiet until Young Blood and the Gangbanger round the 
           corner.  Quietly step to Grimes’ door.  Both armed and 
           looking very dangerous.  A nod and they jam through into --

           GRIMES’ ROOM

           Guns raised, but there’s nothing to shoot at.  It’s empty.

           HALLWAY

           Young Blood and the Gangbanger steps back out.  A confused 
           look up and down’s the hall and then...
                                 YOUNG BLOOD
                        Fuera de aquí.

           As they head back the way they came...

           GRIMES’ ROOM

           The window pulled open from outside.  Grimes out in the 
           branches of the ratty eucalyptus.  As he climbs back in...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - BELL’S HOUSE - HOLLYWOOD KNOLLS - NIGHT

           Bell’s car pulls in.  She gets out.  As she crosses the 
           little lawn to her house (a cottage really)...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Sets her gun and holster, cell and badge on the side table.  
           A lot to carry, it all hits with a thud.  As she continues...

           INT. KITCHEN - BELL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bell enters.  Dark until she opens the fridge.  She pulls out 
           a can of beer.  She elbows the door shut, pops the top even 
           as she turns to find --

           Roman sitting at her kitchen table!

                                 BELL
                        Shit!

           Roman doesn’t move a muscle.  Hands flat on the table.  He 
           doesn’t say a word, doesn’t need to.  A beat and...

           Bell drops the beer, moves hard back the way she came, only 
           to find Metcalf blocking the doorway.

                                                            JUMP AHEAD TO:

           EXT. ROMAN’S HOUSE - SHERMAN OAKS - MORNING

           ESCALADE in the driveway.  Another day another dollar.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - ROMAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Roman in front of the bathroom mirror.  His hair still damp 
           from the shower, he’s in pants and an unbuttoned shirt.  As 
           he leans forward to clip some nose hairs...

                                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. LIVING ROOM - ROMAN’S HOUSE - SHERMAN OAKS - DAY

           The pool visible through three sets of French doors.  Roman 
           enters, passing through when for no particular reason... He 
           stops, takes in the room a moment.  Frowning, picking up on a 
           subtle vibe in the air.  He tries the handle on the first 
           French door - locked.  The second - locked.  Third - 
           unlocked.  A beat as he considers this.  Finally dismissing 
           it, he locks the door.  

           Retrieving his clip holster from a sideboard, he exits.  The 
           room almost seems to exhale in relief at his departure.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. PAY PHONE - DOWNTOWN - DAY

           Grimes at a pay phone.  

                                 BELL’S VOICE
                        This is Bell.  Leave a message and 
                        I’ll return.

           As the phone message BEEPS.

                                 GRIMES
                        It’s Grimes.  I need to talk to 
                        you.  Um, I’ll try at your office.

           He hangs up.  Moving with him, we see he’s across from...

           THE FIRST STREET LAPD HEADQUARTERS

           As he heads that way...

                                                                  CUT TO:

                        Sergeant Bell isn’t in yet.

           Grimes pulls an ENVELOPE from his jacket, hands it over.

                        Would you make sure she gets this?  
                        Or her partner to give to her?  
                        It’s very important.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET CORNER - DAY

           Grimes stands there waiting until a DODGE MAGNUM pulls up.  
           Grimes gets in the back and they roll out.

           DODGE MAGNUM

           Metcalf behind the wheel.  Roman looks back at Grimes all 
           alone in the backseat.  He grins at him before handing him a 
           9MM.  As Grimes gives it the once over...

                                 GRIMES
                        That was doing good; this is doing 
                        bad.  Not exactly the same thing.

                                 ROMAN

           Grimes leans forward as he shoves the gun down into the small 
           of his back.  He and Roman very close.

                                 GRIMES
                        Just like to know the game plan.

           By the LA RIVER.  The Magnum pulls to the curb behind a SHIT 
           SEDAN.  Dockery gets out of it, meets them as they exit.

                                 DOCKERY
                        They’re there.  Second building up.  
                        There’s a back way in.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY - DAY

           They come up in single file.  Dockery leads followed by 
           Roman, Grimes and Metcalf.  All have guns in hand.  The tinny 
           sound of music can be heard behind a steel door: La Raza 97.9  
                                 ROMAN

                        Who’s turn on point?

           Dockery raises his hand.  Roman nods, then shows two fingers 
           to Metcalf, three to Grimes.  As Dockery opens the door...

           INT. WAREHOUSE SPACE

           The music louder, but still far away.  This place is 
           abandoned, desolate.  Dockery leads the way to what amounts 
           to a HOLE IN THE WALL.  A deep breath and he ducks through to 
           the left.  Metcalf follows ducking through to the right.

           Grimes follows them.

           ANOTHER SPACE

           Grimes aiming the gun at a shape in the gloom about fifty 
           feet ahead.  Dockery to his left, Metcalf to his right.

           Roman behind him, he sets his gun firmly between Grimes’ 
           shoulder blades.

           Grimes raises his hands.  Roman takes his gun.  Metcalf aims 
           at Grimes as well.

           Dockery, meanwhile, steps to the wall, flips a switch.  One 
           hard light comes up revealing the shape in the gloom is...

           Bell.  Handcuffed to a metal chair.  Gagged.  Very much 
           awake.  Grimes obviously didn’t expect this.

                        All those years you were inside, I

                        you’re gonna have to die for the 
                        both of us.  

           Grimes just stares back at Bell.  No reaction to speak of.

                        pushed you.  What we’re going to do 
                        is make it look like you shot her

           Roman holsters his own gun, steps around to face Grimes.

           Roman sets the gun he just took from Grimes almost to Grimes’ 
           forehead.

                        were on to him, huh?  Me.  It was 
                        me.  All to get a shot at beautiful 
                        Carly Grimes.  Love and war, right?  
                        She had no idea I set you up.  And 
                        I thought I’d have years to show 
                        her how I felt about her.  And what 
                        does God do?  He gives her fucking 
                        cancer.  
                               (to Metcalf)
                        You believe that shit?

           Roman then places the barrel of Grimes gun against Grimes’ 
           forehead and pulls the trigger --

           CLICK.  Grimes’ only concession is a blink.   

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Did you really think I was going to 
                        let you walk in here with a loaded 
                        gun?

           The space charged with impending doom.  And then:

                                 GRIMES
                        No.

                        No, I didn’t think you’d let me 
                        walk in here with a loaded gun.

           Uttered with supreme matter-of-factness.  Roman frowns.  
           Grimes still stares at him.  Looks through him, in fact.

                        I know what you did.  I know you 
                        tried to have me killed in prison.  
                        I know everything.

           Roman ever so slightly unnerved.  A first for him.

                        You guys must’ve read the police

                        A few days ago?

           Grimes like a cat that ate a 200 pound canary.

                                 GRIMES (CONT’D)
                        I took six pounds of dope out of

                                 ROMAN
                        Did you?

           A little viciousness seeps into Grimes’ voice.

                                 GRIMES
                        One of the dealers had a BMW.  I 
                        parked it in your lot at Kustom 
                        last night.  That's what the

                        them the warrant for your house.

                        That’s where the dope is.  Planted 
                        in your house.

           Roman tries to process.  Metcalf and Dockery exchanging a 
           very concerned look.  Bell would applaud if she could.

                                 GRIMES (CONT’D)
                        So’s the gun that killed Childress.  
                        Same gun that shot up that sweat 
                        shop.  Same gun that killed 
                        Burgess.  It’s all in your house.

           Roman blinks at him, still processing.  Grimes vicious.

                                 GRIMES (CONT’D)
                        Just like it was planted in my

           Roman steadying as his mind whirs.

                                 ROMAN 
                        I knew it this morning at my place.  
                        I knew I was breathing someone

                                 GRIMES
                        Good luck finding it.

           WHUMP!  Roman pistol whips Grimes.  He goes down in a heap.

                                 ROMAN
                        And what cop is supposed to go in

                        It gets worse.

           As the boys exchange panicked looks, Grimes finds himself

           gives her back a subtle head shake ‘no’.  

           Roman looks from Dockery to Grimes, to Metcalf.

           something, stops.  Finally, staring out the window.

           Dockery looks over at Grimes who looks at him.  A deadly

           Castro leans forward from the backseat, see Grimes as well.

           Metcalf watching Grimes and Dockery disappear inside the 
           halfway house.  A beat and then Young blood is getting out of 
           a car down the street along with a badly limping Castro.  
           Then from another car: THREE gangbangers we’ll call HOWLERS.

           Grimes coming around the corner followed by Dockery.  Dockery 
           has his gun out now.  Grimes stops outside his own door, 
           looks to Dockery who nods.  Grimes knocks.

                                 GRIMES
                        Hey, Luna.  It’s me, Grimes.

           But out of the corner of his eye, he’s watching Young Blood 
           and Castro coming around the corner as well.

           Their guns come up -- Grimes drives his shoulder into his own 
           door -- As Castro starts spraying bullets down the hall... 
           BANG-BANG-BANG!  
           Young Blood caught in the crossfire as Dockery FIRES back.

           Dockery hit - Firing back.  Castro goes down.  Dockery down.

           Grimes through the door into his room as the howlers pursue. 

           GRIMES’ ROOM

           Grimes smashing through the window as the three howlers and 
           Young Blood enter a beat later.

           EXT. HALFWAY HOUSE - DAY

           Grimes drops to an overhang below.  WHUMP!  So far so good, 
           but MUZZLES FLASH above, BULLETS CHEW the stucco around him.

           Two hard steps and he leaps into the EUCALYPTUS TREE out 
           front.  Still getting fired at -- Losing his grip and --

           MAGNUM

           Metcalf and Bell reacting to gunfire coming from the upstairs 
           window.  Then to --

           THE SIDEWALK

           Grimes falls the last 8-feet to the ground.  Lands FLAT ON 
           HIS BACK -- UMPHH!

           Wind knocked out of him, trying to get it back, when the 
           first howler hits the branches overhead.  BANG!  A round 
           slams down next to him, Grimes is on his feet and running. 

           MAGNUM

           Metcalf agog as the howlers drop one-two-three from the tree.  
           They take off in pursuit about sixty feet behind...

           GRIMES

           Hands cuffed, but he motors.  More gunfire, bullets whizzing 
           by.  He leaves the sidewalk, pounds across the street, bangs 
           through a narrow alley between two houses.  The howlers on 
           his heels.  And --

           MAGNUM

           Tearing out to try to follow.

           PARALLEL STREET

           On Grimes as he crosses.  A horn blares, brakes screech as a 
           car (entering frame left) locks it up to keep from hitting 
           him.  One of the howlers leaps, two steps across the hood of 
           it and back down again.
           And here comes the Magnum fishtailing around the corner.

           And we’re in a PARKING LOT as we lead Grimes across.  BANG!  
           BANG!  They fire wildly behind him as they chase -- and we 
           reverse behind him to show we are in --

           THE DO-IT CENTER PARKING LOT

           -- As Grimes ducks through the just opening front doors and 
           the howlers scoot through after him --

           MAGNUM

           Skidding to a stop in the parking lot.  Metcalf not knowing 
           what to do.  Bell trying the door handle.  It’s locked.

           INT. AISLE 6 - THE DO-IT CENTER - DAY

           GUNFIRE.  A round chews through lawn & garden supplies on 
           either side of the aisle 6 and --  Here comes Grimes skidding 
           around the corner.  Hauling ass.  His destination ahead: the 
           hose coils.  The lead howler appears behind, raises a TEC-9.

           Grimes baseball slides to the hoses, rips the particular coil 
           loose as the Tec-9 lets rip.  And Grimes grabs Villa’s sawed 
           off, twists around and BOOOM!

           As the lead howler goes down, he drops the Tec-9.  It 
           clatters to Grimes who scoops it up as howlers two & three 
           rumble down FIRING -- and RAT-A-TAT-TAT -- They die as well.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. DO-IT CENTER PARKING LOT - DAY

           Metcalf standing outside the Magnum, gun held to his side.  
           Bell looking out the passenger side window.  As Metcalf takes 
           a few tentative steps forward.

           Grimes exits with the shotgun.  

           As Bell starts to climb over the seat...

           Metcalf fires.  Customers ducking for cover as Grimes fires 
           back.  BOOM!  Metcalf goes down.

           Bell out the door of the Magnum.  Kicking Metcalf’s gun away, 
           she pats him down, finds the handcuff key.  Grimes steps up.

                                 BELL
                        You okay?

           She unlocks her cuffs, goes about unlocking his.  As soon as 
           Grimes is uncuffed, he moves to the Magnum, gets behind the 
           wheel.  As she runs around to the other side, the lock clicks 
           down.  She pounds a fist into the glass.
                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m coming with you!

                                 GRIMES
                        You’re not.

           And he’s tearing out.  Bell cursing, watches after him a beat 
           before going back to Metcalf.  As she finds his CELLPHONE...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. ROMAN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SHERMAN OAKS - DAY

           Roman pulling apart the room.  Shambles.  Dumping out drawers 
           and clattering to the floor - the GUN that killed Childress.  
           Roman just stares at it and --

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. ROMAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SHERMAN OAKS - DAY

           Roman wreaking havoc on the living room sideboard.  Pulling 
           out drawers -- Looking into the spaces.  Nothing --

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - ROMAN’S HOUSE - DAY

           He looks in the microwave -- Nothing.  Opens the oven door...  
           A Ralph’s bag!  Full of COCAINE.  Sidney wasn’t fucking 
           kidding.  As Roman considers it.... the doorbell RINGS.  

           Roman draws his gun.  MOVE WITH him down the hall.  Gun at 
           his hip, he checks the peephole then opens the front door...

           THE PORCH 

           To nothing.  Nobody.  What the fuck?  And then from inside -- 
           the sound of GLASS BREAKING.  Fuck!

           Roman shuts the door, walks carefully, smoothly back through 
           the entryway and into...

           THE LIVING ROOM

           No one there.  But the glass on the third French door has 
           been smashed.  It’s partially swung open.  Someone’s in the 
           house.  Roman dead still, listening for a clue -- Nothing.  
           He looks to the bar doors leading to...

           THE KITCHEN

           State of the art.  More French doors look out on the pool.  
           Roman enters through the bar doors, leading with the gun.  He 
           sweeps the room with his eyes.
           A CREAKING SOUND behind him.  Roman wheels and fires: BOOM-
           BOOM-BOOM!  Through a closed door.

           Stepping up, holding the gun with both hands, he kicks the 
           door in, enters...

           A LARGE PANTRY

           Several CANS have been blown apart on the facing wall, but 
           that’s all.  A solid BUTCHER BLOCK in the center of the room.  
           Roman arcs around to check behind it -- Nothing.

           Roman heads back out -- As we lead him into...

           THE KITCHEN

           He has no idea that behind him - tucked in a recess between 
           the pantry door and the bathroom stands GRIMES.  Shotgun held 
           across his chest.  Roman finally tweaks.  As he wheels --

           WHACK!  Grimes brings the butt of the shotgun up under 
           Roman’s chin!  Roman drops the gun, staggers.  Grimes grabs 
           him, sends him forward SMASHING straight through --

           The French doors and out to...

           EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Roman sprawls to the deck.  Grimes stepping through the 
           shattered door after him.  Swings his leg back and --

           WHUMP!  The air leaves Roman’s lungs.  And WHUMP again!

           Roman collapses.  Grimes tosses the shotgun aside, hauls 
           Roman to his feet and rushes him back WHAM against the 
           outdoor fireplace.

           Holding him up with his left hand, Grimes wings his right 
           elbow into Roman’s face,  Once, twice, three times, real 
           prison style.  Roman gagging, spitting teeth.

           Grimes grabs him by the shoulders, flings him forward 
           sprawling near the edge of the pool.  Grimes looms: a beat 
           passes.  Finally, Roman looks up, grins through the blood.

                                 ROMAN
                        Can you really die of a broken 
                        heart?  You’re standing there, 
                        Sidney, but is anything left alive?

           WHAM!  Another kick.  And Grimes follows him down, grabbing 
           him by the throat, forcing him back over the edge.  Shoving 
           Roman’s head and shoulders back UNDER THE WATER of the pool. 
           Roman reaches up blindly, grabs at Grimes, but to no avail.  
           And as his struggles lose force and it dawns on us that 
           Grimes is going to drown him  -- Sidney suddenly stops.  

           He hauls a sputtering Roman out of the water.  Flipping him, 
           he sets a knee in Roman’s back, takes his wallet.  Rifling 
           it, he finds Carly’s photo.  Tossing the billfold away, 
           disgust rising, Grimes stands, pockets the photo.  

           Retrieving the shotgun, he sits on the edge of a chaise 
           lounge and waits.  He stares ahead, not at Roman who is 
           finally breathing again, sitting at the edge of the pool.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck you waiting for?  Get 
                        it over with.  
                               (bent grin)
                        See if it gives you a hard on.

                                 GRIMES
                        I’m making a citizen’s arrest.

           Grimes reaches in his shirt, shows Roman the mini-mic end of 
           the WIRE he’s been wearing.

                                 GRIMES (CONT’D)
                        You got the right to remain silent.

                                 ROMAN
                        Come on, fucking shoot me.

                                 GRIMES
                        You’re not gonna like prison, 
                        Roman.  You’re going to struggle.
                               (a beat)
                        You need to stop existing there and 
                        that’s going to be hard for you.  
                        You take up so much space.

                                 ROMAN
                        I am not fucking going to prison. 

           Roman starts to stand.  Grimes clubs him back down.  

                                 GRIMES
                        Childress needed to die.  You need 
                        to rot in a hole.  End of story.

           A final settle and then Roman switches gears:

                                 ROMAN
                        It’s a mutherfucker.  Isn’t it?

                                 GRIMES
                        What?
                                 ROMAN
                        Being here.  Without her.  

           Grimes looks at him.  And if these two share anything this 
           entire time, it’s right here.  In this moment.  Finally...

                                 GRIMES
                        She was never yours to be without.

           The moment is over.  Roman shifts gears.

                                 ROMAN
                        You know, I didn’t kill Carly, 
                        Sidney.  Childress didn’t kill her 
                        either.  You wanna know who killed 
                        her?  You did.  You let your world 
                        touch hers.
                               (a beat)
                        She was so busy trying to keep you 
                        out of jail, she ignored what was 
                        wrong with her.  By the time she 
                        went to the doctor?  Too fucking 
                        late.  All because of you.  

           Grimes takes Roman’s words on stoically.  If that’s Roman 
           hitting back he’s gonna have to hit harder.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        You would have been proud of her 
                        those last few days.  Still 
                        beautiful, still with that goddamn 
                        strength of hers.  Until the 
                        morphine really clocked her out.  
                        And me sitting in that fucking dead 
                        room playing that dumb opera song 
                        of hers, over and over.  While she 
                        said goodbye to you.

           Roman crying now.  And Grimes still stoic as they memorize 
           each other’s faces into dust.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        You really think you got nothing 
                        left to lose, don’t you?

           And Roman plays his last card.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Carly’s here.  She’s right in the 
                        other room.  She’s been waiting for 
                        you.  Ten long years.

           Somehow Roman is telling the truth.  As Grimes wonders how...

                                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. SCREENING ROOM - ROMAN’S HOUSE - DAY

           A projection screen on the wall.  Roman leads, obviously in a 
           lot of pain.  Grimes follows, carries the shotgun.

                                 ROMAN
                        She made the tape a week out from 
                        the end.  But I figured, fuck him, 
                        he’s never seeing it. Here it sits.

           Roman opens an equipment cabinet.  Grimes raises the shotgun.

                                 GRIMES
                        Slow.

           Roman powers up the equipment, reaches for an old VHS tape.  
           He wags it at Grimes before sliding it into the VHS player.

                                 ROMAN
                        Look at all this shit.  I don’t 
                        even watch TV, but I had to spend 
                        the cash somewhere.

           The screen comes to life.  It’s washed out, low-res, but 
           there she is: CARLY GRIMES.  Sitting in a chair in a hospital 
           day room.  Wearing a knitted newsboy hat over her bald 
           radiated head.  Eyes big, mouth big, everything else small 
           and sunken.  She’s already halfway to being a ghost.  

                                 CARLY
                        Is it on?

                                 ROMAN’S VOICE (VIDEO)
                        It’s on.

                                 CARLY
                        You can cut out the bad ones?  I 
                        only want him to see the best one.

                                 ROMAN
                               (to Grimes)
                        I never got around to it.  This is 
                        what we like to call raw footage.

           Grimes isn’t listening.  Carly looks right at him.

                                 CARLY
                        Hey, Sidney.  Hey.  I just want you 
                        to know that I’m not afraid...

           She pauses, tears roll big and fat down her cheeks.

                                 CARLY (CONT’D)
                        I screwed that up.  Turn it off.

           The image frazzles a moment, then comes back on.  Take 2.
                                 ROMAN
                        Look at that.  She’d break the 
                        devil’s heart in two.

                                 CARLY
                        It’s running?

                                 ROMAN’S VOICE (VIDEO)
                        Uh huh.  Take your time.

           She looks at Sidney, takes a deep breath.

                                 CARLY
                        Hey, Mr. Blue.  Remember when I 
                        gave you that name?  I knew you 
                        didn’t like it.  But what else was 
                        I gonna call you?  You were always 
                        so sad at first and I could never 
                        figure it out.  It would really 
                        confuse me, remember?  And then you 
                        told me why.  Because you could see 
                        how it was pushing us apart.  And 
                        you made it bring us close together 
                        instead.  Mr. Blue.

           She pauses, fights what is overwhelming.  Tries to hold it 
           together, it’s heart wrenching.  And for Grimes, a kind of 
           awful miracle.  She’s here, with him.  Always looking at him.

           And as Roman’s presence is pushed to the back of his mind, 
           Roman is very aware of the fact.  He sidelongs a glance at 
           Grimes, gauges the distance between them.

                                 CARLY (CONT’D)
                        The other morning I woke up and I 
                        thought I saw your jacket.  On the 
                        chair in my room and I thought you 
                        were here.  But... I’m not afraid.  
                        It’s like I’m in the back of a car, 
                        looking out the window.  And you’re 
                        out in the street.  Getting smaller 
                        and smaller.  And I keep thinking, 
                        as long as I keep going straight, 
                        I’ll always be able to see you, no 
                        matter how small you get.

           And as she starts crying again -- ROMAN (timing it) MOVES -- 
           Wings a roundhouse into the side of Grimes’ neck.

           As Grimes staggers, Roman mauls him.  The shotgun clattering 
           to the floor.  Grimes drops to a knee.  WHAM!  WHAM!

           Roman grabs the gun and as Grimes lurches back up, Roman 
           clubs him down.  He looms, aims the shotgun at his head.
                                 ROMAN
                        Son of a bitch.

           Grimes’ eyes flicker open.  He could care less about Roman, 
           his eyes looking to the screen as Take 3 begins...

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Tell her goodbye, you fuck.

           As Roman goes to pull the trigger, Grimes weakly bats the 
           barrel away.  Roman aims again.  Grimes bats again and -- 
           BOOM!  The blast blows a hole in the floor.

           Roman digs a toe into Grimes’ head.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do that.

           As Roman aims again, we rack focus past him as BELL ENTERS 
           THE ROOM, her service revolver aimed dead on Roman.

                                 BELL
                        Drop it.
                               (as Roman reacts)
                        Now.

           Keeping the gun on Grimes, Roman grins at Bell.

                                 ROMAN
                        Know what my problem is, bitch?  
                        God help me, but I keep operating 
                        under the assumption that life can 
                        have a happy ending.

           Then looking hard to Grimes, finger tightening on the trigger 
           to kill him -- BANG!

           Bell shoots Roman dead.

           She kneels beside Grimes.

                                 CARLY
                        Are you okay?

           Whatever’s wrong with him, he shakes it off, sits up to watch 
           the screen.  Carly finally has it all together.

                                 CARLY (CONT’D)
                        All my life there were things I 
                        wanted.  But the only thing I ever 
                        needed was you.  Sidney.  With me.  
                        Your love next to mine.  And now 
                        you gotta let me go, baby.  But not 
                        in that rage you’re gonna be in.  
                        God, I know how you’re gonna be 
                        when you get out.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CARLY (CONT’D)
                        Full of blame and guilt and needing 
                        someone to forgive you.  Ray 
                        Childress better hope he’s dead, 
                        right?  Or moved to China.  But you 
                        gotta let all that go.  Cuz you go 
                        that way, it’ll kill you.  You’ll 
                        be left for dead.  And I don’t want 
                        my baby left for dead.  I want my 
                        baby to live.  You gotta live.  For 
                        me, for you, for us.  There’s life 
                        out there. I know how you are, but 
                        I know you can see it, too.  You 
                        don’t need forgiving.  Not for 
                        loving me.  So please live.  
                        Because I love you, Sidney Grimes.  
                        I love your guts and I’m asking you 
                        to live.  It’s the only way this’ll 
                        make sense.  Okay?

           She kisses her fingers, extends them out.

                                 CARLY (CONT’D)
                        It was sweet seeing you again.
                               (gulps)
                        Good bye, love...

                                 GRIMES
                               (whispered)
                        Good bye...

           Carly looks past camera now, sniffs back a tear:

                                 CARLY
                        That’s the one...  

           She reaches toward camera.  Past it.  And as she turns off 
           the camera... The screen goes to static.  And for just a beat 
           this is a holy place.  

           Bell reaches out to touch Grimes on the shoulder.  Her hand 
           never quite gets there though.  And...

                                                                WE CUT TO:

           EXT. ROMAN’S HOUSE - SHERMAN OAKS - DAY

           Grimes, hands cuffed, is guided by Fowler into the back of a 
           DETECTIVE’S CAR.  Fowler puts his hand on the top of his head 
           so he won’t bump it.  As Grimes pulls his legs in, Fowler 
           closes the door.  He looks over as Bell steps over.

                                 BELL
                        I want to take him in.  I brought 
                        in a lot of dirty cops, Ron.  I 
                        want to see how it feels to drive 
                        in an innocent one.
           Fowler gives her a look.  She gives him one back.  Knowing 
           its hopeless, Fowler tosses her the car keys.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. DETECTIVE’S CAR - ROLLING THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - DAY

           Bell behind the wheel.  Grimes very quiet in the back.

                                 BELL
                        This is messed up.
                               (a beat)
                        This is why cops have no friends.  
                        Not even other cops.  This is why 
                        nobody likes a cop.  Especially IA.

                                 GRIMES
                        Is that what you want?  People to 
                        like you?

                                 BELL
                        I wouldn’t mind if you did.

           Grimes, in his indomitable style, doesn’t answer.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m racking my brain, but I don’t 
                        see how you’re gonna avoid going 
                        back to prison.
                               (a beat)
                        I actually think the drugs could 
                        stick with Roman.  And maybe even 
                        Childress.  Any one of them we 
                        could get around, but the totality 
                        of it... I don’t know.

           He doesn’t answer as she turns left onto MAGNOLIA.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna need to get your story 
                        straight that’s for sure.

           Finally, Grimes speaks.

                                 GRIMES
                        I’m not going to lie.

                                 BELL
                        What do you mean?

                                 GRIMES
                        I’m gonna tell the truth.  I’m 
                        wired that way.

           It hangs there a beat.
                                 BELL
                        Your wife must’ve had her hands 
                        full with you.

           As Bell pulls to the curb, stops the car.  Sidney can only 
           wonder why as she exits the car.  A moment later, she’s 
           opening the back door, unlocking his handcuffs.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        Get out.

           He does as he’s told, finds himself looking across at...

           EXT. GREYHOUND STATION - NORTH HOLLYWOOD - DAY

           BUSES coming and going.  To all four corners.

           Bell holds out about $150 in cash.

                                 BELL
                        It’s all I got.  

                                 GRIMES
                        What are you going to say happened?

                                 BELL
                        Oh, unlike you, I can tell lies all 
                        day long.

           Grimes reaches out, takes the dough.  They regard each other.  
           So much to say, but where would you start?

                                 GRIMES
                        Thank you.

           She waves it off.

                                 BELL
                        So what are you going to do?

           He considers, shrugs...

                                 GRIMES
                        I spent the last ten years thinking 
                        time only made sense backwards.  
                        That everything was memory, regret.  
                        But if you don’t have a future, 
                        it’s all just chaos.  

                                 BELL
                        Yeah, but what are you going to do?

           He starts to answer, shakes his head.
                                 GRIMES
                        Words are bullshit. I just got done 
                        telling someone that the other day.

                                 BELL
                        Try me.  I need to know what I’m 
                        turning loose on the world.

                                 GRIMES
                        The only thing I was ever good at 
                        was being a cop.  So...

                                 BELL
                               (confused)
                        Yeah, but, how would you...

                                 GRIMES
                        I don’t know.  Unofficially.  In 
                        spirit.  I’ll send you a postcard 
                        when I figure it out.

           A beat.  That’s all there is.  Grimes turns and heads toward 
           the bus station.  Leaving town the same way he got into it.

                                 BELL
                        Hey Grimes!

           He turns, looks back.

                                 BELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m no expert, but I think north’s 
                        that way.

           She points.  And he smiles for the first and only time.

           And as she watches him go...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. GREYHOUND - VENTURA FREEWAY NORTH - DAY

           Grimes staring out the window as the bus rolls.  Headed 
           north.  Next stop somewhere.   As we let him go...

           The End.
