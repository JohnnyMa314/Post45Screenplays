                        JEFF, WRONG WAY!!! WRONG WAY!!!

                                                         WE OPEN OUR EYES:

           We’re driving a Volvo. An 18-wheeler heads right at us! 
           The wail of the air horn is confusing. We turn. Our best 
           friend HANK MORGAN (46, PAUNCHY) screams:

                                 HANK MORGAN
                        WRONG FUCKING WAY! WRONG FUCKING--

           We turn away from Hank, back to the semi. We jerk the 
           wheel: our Volvo sharks across two lanes, jumps over a 
           curb, shoots into a tree! Hank’s head bounces off the 
           dash! Our own head collides with the steering wheel!

                        drop. Replayers are not unlike 
                        giraffes, dropped violently into a 
                        reality that for them did not 
                        exist prior to impact. It’s the 
                        part you never quite get used to.

           Both men have minor head wounds.

                                 HANK
                        You okay?

           INT. VOLVO - MORNING - DECEMBER 21, 1988

           JEFF ZATKOWSKI (43) sits behind the wheel.  He is banged 
           up, but shakes it off.

                                 JEFF
                        She’s gone, Hank. Chloe’s gone.

                        She’s been gone for a while, man--

           Jeff grabs the New York Times from Hank’s briefcase, sees 
           the date on the paper: DECEMBER 21, 1988.

                                 JEFF

                        Lockerbie, killing 270 people.

           Pam scribbles: 3:01, 103, 270, LOCKERBEE?

                        Don’t terrorists typically wait 
                        until after a bombing, to claim 
                        responsibility?

                                 JEFF
                        I’m not a terrorist, and the 
                        bombing’s not the story.

                                 PAM
                        So what is?

                                 JEFF
                        Let’s meet up. I could come by the 
                        studio. Or what’s that bar around 
                        the corner from your place? The 
                        White Horse Tavern?

           This catches her off guard.

                                 PAM
                        I don’t live there. I moved in 
                        with my boyfriend last week.

                        moving? And having a boyfriend?

                        Just pretend I’m a regular guest.

           REVEAL a small staff and crew including WALTER, are in 
           the studio, on the floor, hands zip-tied.

           The windows are covered. The doors are blockaded. Two 
           camera men operate cameras, as everyone else watches.

                        I’m sorry, about that. After we’re 
                        done, I’ll turn myself over to the

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Jeff’s VOLVO is rocking. The windows are steamed up.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        I’d always wanted to be a writer, 
                        but for some reason, the great 
                        American novel had boycotted my 
                        typewriter. Every year I lowered 
                        my standards until I got a job 
                        writing copy at an ad agency. 
                        Eventually that led to this. Which 
                        occasionally led to this. It was 
                        never about the sex. It was about 
                        escape. About being someone else.

           The rocking stops. The passenger door opens, the redhead 
           exits, fixing her skirt, closing the door behind her.

           INT. VOLVO - SAME

           Jeff’s in the front seat, zipping his pants up. He opens 
           the ashtray, fishes his wedding band out, puts it on.

           There’s a knock on the window. Jeff opens the door, his 
           secretary is there.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Hank called. You were supposed to 
                        pick him up 45 minutes ago.

           EXT. FBI HQ - NEWARK, NJ - NIGHT

           Hank’s sitting on the curb in front of the Newark FBI 
           Field office when Jeff pulls up in his Volvo.

                                 HANK

           INT. ZATKOWSKI APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Plastic covered furniture. TV encased in wood. Jeff’s dad 
           (JACK, 79) sits in front of a TV. Jeff’s mom (SOPHIE, 75) 
           leans over, speaking loudly:

                        Mad? My father remembered a world 
                        where my daughter was still alive. 
                        I wasn’t mad. I was envious.

           The phone rings. Sophie answers it on a cordless, then:

                                 SOPHIE
                        It’s Linda.

           Jeff enters--
           INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

           The walls are covered with mismatched framed photos of 
           Jeff and his family in every stage of life. 

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, Lynn. I’m at my parents, can

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

                        No. It can’t.

                        Jeff, we need...

           All of sudden, white noise infiltrates the room. Jeff’s 
           looking at random pictures of himself: in high school, as 
           a baby, at the altar with Linda, holding Chloe.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        And that’s all I heard: “Jeff, we 
                        need.” But what did we need? To 
                        talk? To have sex more than once a 
                        year? To see a marriage counselor? 
                        To get a divorce? I was in a world 
                        of need. All I did was need. I 
                        needed a new job, self-esteem. A 
                        daughter that doesn’t die.

           Jeff’s looking at a photo of his daughter Chloe, age 4.

                                                                   BLACK.

           JEFF POV - ON A MOVIE-SCREEN AT A DRIVE-IN

           Hitchcock’s “The Birds” plays. Jeff feels a sensation in 
           his lap. A GORGEOUS GIRL sits next to him, giving him a 
           handjob, while intently watching the movie. We are--

           INT. ‘57 FORD - PARKED - NIGHT

           Audio’s pumped into the car through a speaker balanced on 
           the driver’s door. The girl feels Jeff’s eyes on her. She 
           has a heavy southern accent.

           families in period dress. He looks at the license plate 
           in front of him: Georgia. He gets out of his car.

                        It was exactly as I’d remembered

                        I told you that was strong pot, 
                        man. Didja smoke the whole thing?

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Last I’d heard of my college 
                        roommate Ronnie Slater was he got 
                        drafted into Vietnam, was captured 
                        and spent the early 70’s in a POW 
                        camp.

           EXT. DORMITORY - DAY

           Jeff exits the dorm, begins walking across a great mall. 
           A touch football game is in progress.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Was I dead? Was it a dream?

           Jeff takes in the scene: The dogwoods are in bloom, the 
           girls of Harris Hall lounge about in Bermuda shorts and 
           sandals. Jeff touches the gash in his head from the fall.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Maybe I’d never been beyond 1963. 
                        Maybe this was real and 1988 was 
                        the dream...

           INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT

           Jeff sits on the couch watching TV.

                                 WALTER CRONKITE
                        Martin Luther King, Jr. was 
                        arrested in a Birmingham protest 
                        for parading without a permit...

           Jeff continues to watch the news.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        But it was becoming increasingly 
                        clear that it hadn’t been a dream.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Jeff’s surrounded by students. A professor lectures.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        So what was I gonna do now? Just 
                        play along? Feel up teenage girls? 
                        Go back to classes and memorize 
                        statistical tables I’d long since 
                        forgotten and had never found any 
                        use for so I could pass Sociology?

           Jeff rises from his seat, leaves in the middle of class.

           CU ON A SUITCASE

           Jeff dumps his clothes into the suitcase. We are--

           INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

           Ronnie enters, sees Jeff packing up.

                                 RONNIE
                        What’re you doing?

                                 JEFF
                        Not repeating college.
                                 (looks up)
                        Is the stereo mine?

           EXT. DORM BUILDING - DAY

           Jeff and Ronnie carry boxes. One of the boxes has Jeff’s 
           stereo sticking up out of it.

                                 RONNIE
                        Is this because of Kathy?

                                 JEFF
                        Karen... No.

                                 RONNIE
                        Then why are you dropping out?

                        Because it’s the fucking 60’s.

           Jeff pops the trunk on the ‘57 Ford. An Air Force ROTC 
           drill takes place nearby. The drill reminds Jeff:

                                 JEFF
                        Listen... I don’t know if this is 
                        gonna happen or not, but... If you 
                        get drafted into Vietnam don’t go.

                                 RONNIE
                        Huh?

                                 JEFF
                        Vietnam. Avoid it. Go to Canada. 
                        Cut off a finger. Just don’t go. 
                        If you do, you’ll wind up in a POW 
                        camp, and it’ll wreck your life.

                                 RONNIE
                        How can you know that?

                                 (looks around, beat)
                        Because I’m from the future.

           Jeff gets in the car, drives away.

                                 RONNIE
                        I told him it was strong pot.

           INT. ‘57 FORD - DAY - 1963

           Jeff drives, slaps the wheel in time with Bob Dylan’s 
           “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right.”

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        I could do anything, go anywhere.

           INT. IDLEWILD AIRPORT - DAY - 1963

           A little hub, nothing like the JFK it will grow into. A 
           Super G Constellation takes off.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        But I didn’t know what to do or

           HENRY (50) a black baggage handler calls out:

                        Boss, who you like for the Derby?

                        of getting nothin’ from somethin’.

           Jack turns, surprised to see Jeff. He smiles.

           HANK MORGAN (21) crosses the quad, catches up to a CO-ED.

                        Only one way to find out.

           She scribbles her number down on a piece of paper, folds 
           it half, seductively squeezes into the palm of his hand.

           Hank smiles, then he unfolds the paper: “NOT IF YOU WERE 
           THE LAST MAN ON EARTH.” He looks up, her middle-finger's 
           extended as she walks away.

                        right, and I am right, you’ll 
                        clean up without risking a dime.

           Hank thinks about it. Fuck it.

                        Better tell me again, how to 
                        pronounce that name. I don’t want 
                        to bet on the wrong horse.

           CLOSE-UP ON A RUBY RED MOUTH

           as the luscious mouth begins to speak:

                        “Chateaugay made his move with a

           Ruby's ample bosom is obscured by the paper from which 
           she is reading. Bummer.

                                 RUBY
                        “Chateaugay will ring forever

           REVERSE to Hank watching Ruby with a smile. They’re in--

           Naked ruby, discreetly covered, is on her knees, reading.

                        Do it again. Jeff, get in here!

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - SAME

           Jeff, in another part of the suite, hits a button and the 
           drapes part: A panoramic view of Las Vegas at sunset. Sin 
           City lit up like a Christmas Tree. Hank enters.

                                 HANK
                        You gotta watch her say Chateaugay 
                        came from behind. Think I’m gonna 
                        name my first kid Chateaugay.

                        That was my grandfather’s name.

                                 JEFF
                        If you have to ask.

                        Then why me?

                                 JEFF
                        I needed a partner.

           Ruby enters the room, naked... bombshell.

                                 JEFF
                        Looks like I’m not the only one.

           EXT. POOLSIDE - FLAMINGO HOTEL - MORNING

           Jeff swims laps under the blazing sun. He gets out of the 
           pool, falls back in a lounge chair, sips a morning Bloody 
           Mary while reading the sports section.

                                 SHARLA
                        Mind if I sit on it?

           Jeff looks up: a beauty queen: wet black hair, sculpted 
           cheek bones, big, firm breasts, elegant legs, an ass you 
           can bounce quarters off of, olive skin, black bikini.

                                 SHARLA
                        The chair?

           She gestures at the empty chair next to Jeff.

                                 JEFF
                        Have a seat... I get you a drink?

                        All that money you won, I’d think 
                        so. They say you made half a mil 
                        betting on a buncha horse races.

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t believe everything you hear. 
                        It was two horse races. How about 
                        that drink?

                                 SHARLA
                        Harvey Wallbanger.

           Jeff leans over, shakes her hand:

                                 JEFF
                        Jeff Zatkowski. Nice to meet you.

           Sharla laughs. Jeff smiles, signals to the waiter.

                                 JEFF
                        A Harvey Wallbanger for the lady. 
                        Another Bloody Mary for me.

           The waiter nods, walks away.

                                 JEFF
                        So, Harvey, what brings you to Sin 
                        City?

                                 SHARLA
                        Sin, mostly.

                                 JEFF
                        Any one sin in particular?

                                 SHARLA
                        Divorce. When I first arrived 
                        three years ago, I was Sharla 
                        McCormick. Two weeks later, I was 
                        back to Sharla Baker. Like magic.

                                 JEFF
                        I prefer Sharla Baker.

                                 SHARLA
                        So does Mr. McCormick.

                                 JEFF
                        You’re so young. What are you 19?

                                 SHARLA
                        Twenty two. What are you?

                        Wise beyond my years. So, after 
                        your divorce...

                                 SHARLA
                        Vegas seemed as good a place as 
                        any to start over. You?

                        Just taking a break from college.

                                 SHARLA
                        I thought people went to college 
                        to learn how to make money. Seems 
                        you’ve already got that part down.

                        Sands? Riviera?

                                 SHARLA
                        Well gee, you look wet behind the 
                        ears, but upon closer examination, 
                        they are bone dry.

                        Hooker?

                                 SHARLA
                        You’re lucky the waiter’s slow. I 
                        keep the high rollers happy.

                                 JEFF
                        You keep ‘em rolling. 

                                 SHARLA
                        If that makes ‘em happy.

                                 JEFF
                        You’re wasting your time. I don’t 
                        gamble. I only bet on sure things.

           INT. AVANTI - DAY

           Jeff drives. Sharla rides shotgun, sticking her whole 
           body out the window. The John Hooker song finds source on 
           the car’s radio. Jeff pulls Sharla back into the car--

                                 JEFF
                        You’re crazy!

           Jeff considers the irony of her statement.

                        What if that weren’t true?

                        What if you could re-live your

                        Would you do it all the same? 

           Sharla dances on the edge of The Grand Canyon.

                                 SHARLA
                        Do I have to do it all the same?

                                 SHARLA
                        Then I wouldn’t do any of it the

                                 JEFF

                                 SHARLA
                        Just hurts more when you say it.

           Sharla walks toward Jeff, with sin on her mind.

                        But get it straight. I do what I

           She turns a corner, sees a swarm of Maids crawling all 
           over the suite with vacuum cleaners and dust rags. 
           Realizes that Jeff’s gone. She’s crestfallen.

                        Jeff’s poor too. You’re perfect 
                        for each other.

           Linda laughs. Great laugh. Easy to fall in love with.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        I’d forgotten this Linda had ever 
                        existed. We’d met at Lon’s beach 
                        party when we were 18. We dated on 
                        and off for the next ten years. 
                        She always said, we’d met too 
                        young. Maybe she was right.
                                 (then)
                        I could’ve fallen for her all over 
                        again. But then I’d just be a guy 
                        who gets lost on the same road 
                        twice. I wasn’t at this party to 
                        meet Linda.

           Linda begins telling a story. Jeff looks past her.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        The constant refrain of my adult 
                        life had been “if only.” If only 
                        I’d taken up guitar when I was 5, 
                        I could’ve been a rock star. If 
                        only I’d invested in Microsoft 
                        before it split, I’d be rich. But 
                        the biggest “if only” of my life 
                        was standing ten feet away.

           Jeff watches a knockout blonde across the room. A one of 
           a kind girl. A museum piece. Gwynn smiles shyly at Jeff, 
           before returning to her conversation.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Gwynn Lowell’s blood was so blue 
                        Picasso could’ve painted with it. 
                        A Boston Brahmin who looked more 
                        like Grace Kelly than Grace Kelly. 
                        Her scent alone had haunted me for 
                        25 years. She was the reason I was 
                        here. This was the fork in the 
                        road. The girl that got away.

                        Maybe later. Would you excuse me?

           Jeff walks away, leaving Hank and Linda together... Jeff 
           walks across the room, introduces himself to Gwynn.

                                 MRS. LOWELL (PRELAP)

           INT. DINING ROOM - 5TH AVE. APARTMENT - EVENING - 1963

           Old money. Oil paintings of dead kin. Jeff, in his Sunday 
           Best, sits beside Gwynn at the table. Gwynn’s brother, 
           CREIGHTON (21) sits across from her. Her parents HENRY 
           and ELIZABETH (40’s) occupy the heads of the table.

                        It’s better than Zatkowski.

           Gwynn giggles, puts her hand on Jeff’s thigh. The black 
           servants begin to clear.

           A magnificent study. Jeff picks up the phone. Gwynn

                        We’re gonna be in Vietnam for

           Gwynn rises. Naked. Struts over to Jeff, steps out on the 
           balcony, takes Jeff’s Gitanes, takes a drag.

                                 GWYNN

           A PARISIAN outside on a bicycle, distracted by Gwynn’s 
           nakedness, plows right into a parked car.

                        I wanted to see just how far it 
                        would bend. The word was out, and 
                        there wasn’t a bookie or casino in 
                        the country that would accept a 
                        bet from Hank or me. There were, 
                        however, other kinds of bets to be 
                        made, under more genteel names.

           INT. FUTURE INC. OFFICES - DAY

           Hank shows Jeff around the suite of offices on the top 
           floor of the Chrysler Building, with stunning panoramas.

                        This’ll be accounting. Legal’ll be

                        there. The traders’ll be on 76. 
                        And our offices...

           They turn a corner. Jeff’s knockout secretary smiles.

                        Good morning, Mr. Zatkowski.

                        Morning.

           Hank opens the door to Jeff’s office.

                        Behold!

           Cutting edge, modern office. Floor-to-ceiling windows on

                        Even got the Soup Cans you wanted.

           Hank gestures to The Warhol on the wall.

                        You too. So, you and Gwynn, huh?

                        Dunno if you remember her, but--

           There’s a buzz from the desk’s intercom.

                                 INTERCOM
                        Mr. Morgan, Ms. Dimaggio’s here.

                        Send her in.

           Linda enters, smiling. Jeff's in shock.

                                 LINDA
                        Nice to see you again, Jeff.

           Jeff’s speechless.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Hank and Linda had always hated 
                        each other.

           Hank and Linda kiss hello.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        At least I thought they did.

                                 JEFF
                        Would you excuse me for a moment?

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY, NOVEMBER 1963

           Jeff somberly walks down the cold city street.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        The fates had thrown me a cosmic 
                        curveball... But why was I upset? 
                        I didn’t want Linda. I was happy 
                        with Gwynn. So why shouldn’t Hank 
                        and Linda be happy together? It 
                        was a selfish reaction, and it 
                        made me realize that up until that 
                        moment, everything I had done had 
                        been selfish.

                        about something other than myself.

           Jeff stops. He stares at a storefront window filled with 
           TV’s, tuned to JFK addressing the nation.

                        Cleveland, shot him five times in 
                        the middle of a fund-raiser before 
                        being shot by police.

                        a random maniac, the universe’s

                        Happy Birthday to you...

           EXT. WESTCHESTER HOME - DAY - JUNE, 1969

           Lush, sprawling grounds. A birthday party. A little girl 
           blows out five candles atop a cake (This is Hank and 
           Linda’s older daughter LUCY). Jeff and Gwynn watch on.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        In this life, the pain of losing 
                        Chloe was only mine.  

           Linda hands Gwynn the baby.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Because of that, I couldn’t have 
                        another child. But fortunately, 
                        Gwynn wasn’t the mothering kind. 

           Gwynn walks to Jeff and hands him baby Sam.

                                 GWYNN
                        Ten more minutes and we’re gone...

           Gwynn lights a cigarette.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - DAY - 1969

           Jeff and Gwynn sit ready for take-off.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Gwynn was only happy when she was 
                        moving. And I was only happy when 
                        Gwynn was happy. So, when she was 
                        restless, or bored, or felt tied 
                        down... we'd go... anywhere...

           REVEAL they're with a group of hangers on.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        ...but rarely alone.

           Neil Young’s HEART OF GOLD takes us to:

           EXT. POOL - DAY - APRIL, 1973

           Gwynn, killer body in a tiny bikini, suns with a bunch of 
           friends around the pool, drinking.

                                 FRIEND #1
                        Jeff, have you been to the Cannes 
                        film festival? We went last year. 
                        It’s amazing.

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, what films did you see?

                                 FRIEND #1
                        Oh, we didn’t see any films.

           Jeff stands up.

                                 GWYNN
                        Where are you going, baby?

                                 JEFF
                        For a drive.

                                 GWYNN
                        We’re in the middle of the desert. 

           EXT. RIVIERA HOTEL - DAY - 1973

           A valet brings Jeff his car. A sign reads, ELVIS, LIVE:

                                 JEFF
                        Not for much longer.

           Jeff tips the valet, gets into his car.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Vegas had already begun to turn 
                        into an amusement park.

           INT. THE SANDS HOTEL - DAY

           Jeff speaks to the concierge. Tourists walk by with 
           buckets of nickels. Jeff's handed a piece of paper.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        It was bright and flashy and loud.

           EXT. DESERT - DAY

           Jeff drives through the desert as “Heart of Gold” plays.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        But it still had its shadows.

           Jeff pulls up to middle-of-nowhere whorehouse.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff’s led down a seedy hallway by a MADAME (50’s).

                                 MADAME
                        Candy didn’t say you were comin’.

                                 JEFF
                        It’s a surprise.

           Madame knocks on the door: SHARLA BAKER (32) negligee 
           half-open, throws her arms around Jeff, gives him a kiss.

                                 SHARLA
                        Hey, baby.

                                 JEFF
                        Surprised to see me?

                                 SHARLA
                        Totally, come on in.

           Jeff enters.

           INT. SHARLA'S ROOM - DAY

           Decorated in early American whore. Reddish hue.

                                 JEFF
                        It’s been a while.

                                 SHARLA
                        I know. Gimme a sec, wouldya?

           Sharla disappears into the bathroom.

                                 SHARLA
                                 (from the bathroom)
                        How’ve you been?

                                 JEFF
                        I’ve been on a weird ride.

                                 SHARLA
                        Haven’t we all, baby.

                                 JEFF
                        Not like this... Look, Sharla...

           She opens the door, confused.

                                 SHARLA
                        How do you know my name?

           And it’s then that Jeff realizes she doesn't know him.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           Jeff packs a suitcase. Gwynn enters.

                                 GWYNN
                        What are you doing?

                                 JEFF
                        We’re getting out of here.

                        Where are we going? Aruba?

                                 JEFF
                        Home.

           She walks over to him, puts her arms around him.

                                 GWYNN
                        Thought home was wherever we are.

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t you want to get married? 
                        Build a life? 

                                 GWYNN
                        I like our life the way it is.

                                 JEFF
                        What life?! We live on a plane. In 
                        hotel rooms. It’s all a fucking 
                        mirage. None of it’s real.

                                 GWYNN
                        What the fuck’s real?! A marriage 
                        certificate that says you own me, 
                        like you own everything else? Do 
                        you even love me or am I just the 
                        perfect complement to all of your 
                        other possessions? 

                                 JEFF
                        This from a girl who brought me 
                        home to piss off her father!

                        me. You turned into him. 

           She storms out of the room, slamming the door!

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        I guess Gwynn Lowell was the girl 
                        that got away for a reason.

           Jeff SLAMS his suitcase closed!

           INT. FUTURE INC. OFFICES - DAY - OCTOBER, 1979

           Jeff opens his briefcase, takes out some papers.

                                 CHRISTINE (INTERCOM)
                        There's a man here to see you, Mr. 
                        Zatkowski. He says he's your 
                        college roommate.

           Ronnie Slater enters. Hippie long hair, a beard, and 
           Vietnam rags. Jeff rises, gives him a hug.

                                 JEFF

                        I haven't seen you since... You 
                        know, I can't even remember?

                        Thought about it the whole time I 
                        was in that fuckin’ pit. Damn near 
                        convinced myself that it was in my 
                        head. Then I was in rehab, gettin’ 
                        clean, had a minor heroin problem, 
                        and one day, I look up and I’m in 
                        the freakin’ Zatkowski wing of St. 
                        Fucking Vincent’s Hospital. I did 
                        some research. It quickly became 
                        clear to me that the war wasn’t

           A BUSBOY spills a tray of dishes! Jeff sits alone at a 
           nearby table. Flinches! A WAITER approaches with a bill:

                        Wherever I looked, I saw the 
                        unintended consequences of my 
                        actions. But what really haunted 
                        me, wasn’t my parents’ wrecked 
                        marriage or Ronnie Slater’s death.

           held in Jeff’s hand. It’s a Christmas Card.

                        It was Hank and Linda. I hated 
                        them for being happy, and I hated 
                        myself for hating them.

           Jeff’s sitting at his desk. Alone. Hank enters. Jeff puts 
           the Christmas card in his drawer.

                        What was so important, I had to

           Jeff turns on the TV, indicates space launch.

                                 HANK
                        I’d call NASA.

                        allows you to predict the future, 
                        because for you... the future is

                        For once, I’d like to know what 
                        someone else would do, if they 
                        knew the future. I already know 
                        what I would do. I’d make a lotta

                        break up my parent’s marriage. And 
                        then I’d ask my best friend what 
                        it feels like to fuck my wife.  

           This gets Hank’s attention.

                        isn’t a problem for you.

                                 HANK
                        Why? After all these years?

                        I’m dissolving our partnership.

                        last life had left me with. I

                        Mostly, I would read: Sophocles,

                        did all the things I’d never had

                        into the world after Chloe.

                                 NURSE #1

                        But for all I knew, Karen was 
                        supposed to be a mother, and I’d 
                        prevented that.

           EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - DAY - 1984

           Jeff walks a 12 year old African American boy (WILLIAM) 
           and a 11 year old Vietnamese girl (ANA) to school.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        We adopted William in ‘72, and Ana 
                        a year later. It seemed like a 
                        fair compromise.
           EXT. FRIENDS SEMINARY - GREENWICH VILLAGE - SAME

           They give him a hug and a kiss before running into the 
           school. As they walk in, Gwynn Lowell is exiting...

           Gwynn’s pushing a stroller with an infant and a toddler.

                        No, I guess you wouldn’t remember 
                        me. I’m an old friend of Lon 
                        Cabot’s. Jeff Zatkowski.

                                 GWYNN

                        Oh, do you two still talk?

                                 GWYNN
                        Occasionally. He’s my husband.

                        Wow... I never knew you two were 
                        supposed to end up together... And 
                        I can’t believe you have two kids.

                                 GWYNN
                        Actually, we have three... I just 
                        dropped our eldest boy off.

                                 JEFF

           EXT. CABIN - DAY - 1987

           Jeff looks out at the view. We see Mt. St. Helens in the 
           far distance.

                                 JEFF

           Whap! Jeff gets hit by snowballs! Karen (43) William (10) 
           and Ana (8) laugh.

                        So, it’s me against the world huh?

           A snowball fight breaks out!

                        This life began as a safe harbor 
                        in a terrible storm, but it became 
                        home. And I didn’t want to leave.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - DECEMBER, 1988

           Jeff‘s body’s a harbor for wires and tubes. William (16)

                        would happen. Part of me held onto

                        this life in a way that would, I

           Beeps so steady you can set your watch by it... The EKG 
           goes berserk. We hear nurses hurry into the room. Someone 
           calls a Code Blue. Medical lingo spoken over the erratic 
           EKG. The sound of defib-paddles whomping Jeff. The flat-
           line on the EKG tells us their efforts are in vain.

           BLACK.

           INT. CRAPPY OFFICE - DAY - 1968

           enters.

                                 SUIT
                        Hey, Zatkowski.

           INT. NEW YORK CITY BAR - NIGHT - APRIL, 1969

           Music finds source in a glowing jukebox. Jeff (24) sits 
           at the bar. A BAR GIRL runs her fingers through his hair.

                                 B GIRL

                        Not like this one, baby.

           The B Girl puts a tab of acid on his tongue.

           The door to the bar opens, Jeff turns: Linda Dimaggio 
           (18) enters, makes eye contact with Hank Morgan (21) on 
           the other side of the room. He stands up to greet her. 
           Before Jeff can process that they aren’t supposed to know 
           each other in this life, a waitress walks over to their 
           table. It’s Karen Gordon (18) Jeff tries to shake off the 
           apparition, but then scans the the bar. Everyone in the 
           room is someone he knows intimately:

           Gwynn Lowell (35) sits with Lon Cabot (35) and their kids 
           -- their eldest boy plays a game with young William. Ana 
           braids the hair of Jeff’s dead daughter Chloe (5) who 
           sits with grandparents Jack (50) and Sophie Zatkowski 
           (48). An elderly Linda Dimaggio eats a hamburger with her 
           architect husband. Sharla Baker sits with her negligee 
           half open talking with Karen Gordon (35). Sophie 
           Zatkowski (75) eats with her husband’s mistress.

           clinks glasses with the suicidal post-war version of 
           himself...

           Everywhere we look in the bar various people from Jeff’s 
           lifetimes commune with alternate iterations of themselves 
           and others from whom they should be separated by multiple 
           decades and/or planes of reality.

                        You know what we need?

           The voice comes from the girl sitting beside Jeff... Jeff 
           turns to look at the B-Girl who is now Linda Zatkowski at 
           the time of Jeff’s first death.

                                 JEFF
                        What do we need? I never heard 
                        what we need. I died before you 
                        could tell me.

                        Yeah, she’s about 5’10, blonde and 
                        has tits out to here. I can’t find 
                        her anywhere!

           Sophie punches Jack on the arm.

           All of them begin talking at the same time. A wall of 
           sound. Until...

           Little Chloe steps forward, takes his hand, leads him to 
           the door--

           EXT. JEFF’S CABIN - DAY - SEPTEMBER, 1977

           Jeff inhales the cool mountain air.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Mt. St. Helens would erupt with 
                        deadly fury in three years, an 
                        event I alone recalled. I was in 
                        the grip of forces that could 
                        destroy a mountain, put it back 
                        together and destroy it again like 
                        a child playing in the sand. What 
                        use was there in trying to 
                        comprehend something like that? I 
                        was done trying.

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           Miles Davis plays on the hi-fi in a room crowded with 
           leaning towers of books. Jeff sits reading a book in 
           French.

                        And I was done with people. It was 
                        much less painful to be alone than 
                        it was to mourn the loss of their 
                        company.

           He closes the book.

           INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY - OCTOBER, 1977

           Jeff drives down a winding mountain road.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        In October of 1977, that all 
                        changed.

           EXT. TOWN - DAY

           Jeff drives through the small town. Cars line up at a 
           small gas station. He turns down Main Street and drives 
           past a line of people that stretches around the block.

           INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY - OCTOBER, 1977

           THE STOREKEEPER, an ancient man, starts ringing Jeff up.

                                 STOREKEEPER
                        Got enough here last ya 6 months.

                                 JEFF
                        What’s with the line?

                                 STOREKEEPER
                        Damn oil crisis. Ask me, Nixon 
                        should drop a bomb on them Ay-
                        Rabs, teach ‘em all a lesson.

                                 JEFF
                        I meant the movie theater.

                                 STOREKEEPER
                        It’s “The Vitruvian Man”

                                 JEFF
                        What is?

                                 STOREKEEPER
                        You’re pullin’ my leg... It’s a 
                        movie. Been lines around the 
                        corner since July.
           EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY - 1977

           Jeff waits in the long line.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        For a Replayer, the world’s like a 
                        film playing on a loop. The same 
                        characters acting out the same 
                        scenes, the same plots. Yet here 
                        was a new story-line. A movie that 
                        wasn’t supposed to exist.

           Jeff walks up to the ticket window, puts down his money.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY - SAME

           Jeff sits in the theater. The house lights go down.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Now when you’ve lived over a 
                        hundred years, you’re pretty much 
                        prepared for anything. But nothing 
                        could’ve prepared me for what I 
                        saw in the theater that day.

           Jeff sits in shock, mesmerized by the white glow.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        I recognized many names from the 
                        credits: Kubrick, Lucas. But the 
                        name that interested me most was 
                        the one I didn’t recognize.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER, 1977

           Jeff, part man, part grizzly, barges into a conference 
           room where a big meeting’s in session.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Sir, you can’t go in there!

                        is Jeff Zatkowski.

           The faces around the conference table register awe!

                                 ALAN HOYLE
                        Jeff it’s been years... We were... 
                        You should’ve called. I would’ve 
                        sent a car. Where are you staying? 
                        Can I get you something to drink? 
                        Bernice, get Mr. Zatkowski 
                        something to--

                        No thank you, Bernice. Alan I need 
                        you to set up a meeting with the 
                        Producer of “The Vitruvian Man.”

           Jeff exits.

           INT. PARIS OFFICE BUILDING - DAY - DECEMBER, 1977

           A SECRETARY reaches under the edge of her desk and buzzes 
           someone into the inner office. When she looks up she sees 
           Jeff standing over her.

                        I’m sorry Mr. Zatkowski. We tried 
                        contacting you through your New 
                        York office, but they didn’t know 
                        how to reach you--

                                 JEFF
                        She’s cancelling? Again?

                                 SECRETARY
                        She’s been called away to Tokyo on 
                        business.

           Jeff reaches under the edge of her desk, buzzes himself 
           into the inner office.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           The doors fly open! CAMERA STAYS ON JEFF as he busts into 
           the office and addresses someone standing off-screen:

                                 JEFF
                        Sorry to burst in like this, but 
                        you made a movie about a man who 
                        lives his life over and over and 
                        over again and the funny thing is--

           A few giant SECURITY GUARDS bust in and grab Jeff!

                        IT’S MY STORY!

           As Jeff’s dragged out, he shouts over his shoulder:

                                 JEFF
                        One question! Now that Kubrick 
                        made your movie, you think he’ll 
                        still make The Shining? What about 
                        Full Metal Jacket? Or do you think

                                 JEFF
                        That’s about control. Having lots 
                        of gym memberships keeps you from 
                        getting too attached, which keeps 
                        you from ending up dependent like 
                        your mom. She was one of those 
                        Connecticut stay at home types 
                        whose lunch was two Martinis and a

                        You have a real future as a

                        interview my prom date?

                                 JEFF
                        You didn’t go to the prom. In ‘69 
                        you ran away from home, and went 
                        to live with your Aunt in New 
                        York. You’d just turned fifteen 
                        and your father started looking at 
                        you the way he used to look at 
                        your older sister, Kim. You told 
                        your mother after the first time 
                        you’d fought him off, only she 
                        didn’t hear you or pretended not 
                        to. You thought about killing him, 
                        cutting his throat while he slept, 
                        but running seemed like the better 
                        option. Since the day you left, 
                        you’ve never gone back. Not even 
                        for your mother’s funeral. See, 
                        you are someone who lives life 
                        looking straight ahead. But 
                        because you have no real 
                        connection with the past, and no 
                        real connection in the present, 
                        you feel an unbearable loneliness. 
                        You once told me the only thing 
                        that terrifies you more than being 
                        alone is being with someone.

           Linda’s riveted to the television. Tears roll down her 
           cheeks. She has a phone to her ear.

                        We should at least explain to her 
                        what this is all about... See mom, 
                        Dad’s a sadist. That’s a tendency 
                        to derive pleasure from inflicting 
                        pain and suffering on others... I 
                        did a piece on it in the 80’s. It 
                        was nominated for an Emmy, but 
                        Barbara Walters made Muhammad Ali 
                        cry, so I lost. Anyway, Dad enjoys 
                        the feeling of power and authority 
                        that comes from playing a dominant 
                        role. So, dad... let me ask you a 
                        question: Does it feel better to 
                        hit a little girl? Or to fuck one?

                                 JEFF
                        Because I can’t think about Linda 
                        without thinking about...

           Jeff bathes Pam by moonlight in a steaming outdoor tub.

                        We were each other’s only cure for 
                        a burden of loneliness no one else 
                        could ever begin to understand.

           EXT. CABIN - DUSK - DECEMBER, 23, 1988

           Jeff and Pam sit bundled in Adirondack chairs. Panoramic 
           vista.

                        I’m in Westport til April ‘69. New

                        from ‘72 on. Anything goes wrong, 
                        I’ll leave word with your folks.

                                 JEFF
                        You’re big on lists.

                                 JEFF
                        Careful. If you spend too much 
                        time wondering what something 
                        means, you won’t experience it.

                                 PAM
                        I’ll keep that in mind.

                                 JEFF
                        C’mon. Wasn’t it nice to just live 
                        these past couple of years?

                                 PAM
                        Wouldn’t it be nice to wake up 
                        tomorrow?

           He can’t argue with her there.

                        You know, I’m nine years older 
                        than you. Say we come back in 
                        1967, you’ll be twelve.

                                 PAM
                        Thirteen. And I was very advanced 
                        for my age.

           Beat.

                                 JEFF
                        I love you, Pam.

                        I love you, Jeff.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING - AUGUST, 1970

           LINDA (26) is on top of JEFF (27).

                                 JEFF
                        I love you... Linda?

           Linda finishes. Jeff finishes. Linda rolls off him.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Only a Replayer has to ask: “Is it 
                        all right to cheat on your 
                        girlfriend with your wife?”

           She starts kissing him. Jeff pushes Linda away:

                                 LINDA
                        It’s our honeymoon! It’s all we’re 
                        supposed to do.

                                 JEFF
                                 (to himself)
                        Our honeymoon? It’s 1970?

           Jeff gets out of bed, throws his clothes on.

                                 LINDA
                        Where are you going?

                                 JEFF
                        I’m sorry, Linda. You’re gonna be 
                        a great doctor... Don’t let what 
                        I’m doing change that?

                                 LINDA
                        What are you doing?

           Jeff turns, exits.

           EXT. HOTEL - DAY

           Jeff exits the hotel, walks to a taxi stand.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        I’d lost three years.
                                 (then)
                        I felt bad about Linda but I had 
                        to find you. And I figured the 
                        quicker I left her, the better.

                                 LINDA (O.C.)
                        HEY, JEFF!

           Jeff turns as a vase just misses him, shattering into a 
           thousand little pieces on the street! Everyone, including 
           Jeff, looks up to Linda on the balcony, wearing a sheet.

                                 LINDA
                                 (wrapped in sheet;)
                        FUCK YOU!

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        So much for that theory.

           Hank steps away from the glass.

                        I missed you, man.

                        We just met last night.

                        It’s 10:00 in the morning.

           INT. BAR - MORNING 

           Jeff and Hank sit across from each other drinking beers.

                                 HANK
                        ...but it’s not like I’m kicking 
                        down doors or saving the world. I 
                        drive a desk for the Newark Field 
                        office of the FBI. What’s that 
                        tell you? I fill out a lot of 
                        forms. I’m more of an accountant 
                        with a gun, than an actual FBI 
                        Agent... But every time I try to 
                        advance, I wind up on the reject 
                        pile... God, I hate my life.

                                 JEFF
                        I never realized that.

                                 HANK
                        Never realized what?

                                 JEFF
                        You know, I wanted to be a writer 
                        once. Long time ago. But I kept 
                        ending up in the reject pile too.

           Hank raises his beer bottle. Jeff does too. Clink.

                        Too bad about you and Linda... You 
                        live so close, I thought we could 
                        maybe hang out... Wish I had the 
                        balls to leave my wife. But 
                        Jillian keeps my balls in a safe.

           Jeff knocks on the door. Pam answers the door. She sticks

           INT. SODA SHOP - DAY

           Jeff and Pam drink root beer floats.

                        You told me about your life. You 
                        got very personal... You know, it 
                        was strange... talking to this 
                        version of you that hadn’t yet put 
                        up all of those defensive walls. I 
                        learned more about you talking to 
                        her, than I did during the whole 
                        time we lived together.

           Pam’s sipping her float, when suddenly... She slaps him!

                                 JEFF
                        What was that for?

           CU JEFF--

           swimming in crystal waters. In the b.g. a seemingly 
           infinite ocean. Jeff swims toward a luxury yacht.

           EXT. YACHT - DAY - JANUARY, 1977

           Jeff crosses the yacht dripping wet. Grabs a towel.

           Pam finishes typing, pulls the piece of paper from the 
           typewriter, puts it on the table. Jeff reads the paper

                        Nothing about this is normal. I 
                        lost three years this time. Next 
                        time it could be six. Or maybe 
                        there is no next time. Normal 
                        would be both of us living to see 
                        the year 2000, watching the news 
                        and not knowing what’s gonna 
                        happen. A normal life’s exactly

                        Well open your fuckin’ eyes, Carl!

           Carl walks away and immediately begins to fish the toys 
           out of the pool.

                                 STUART
                                 (smiles)
                        Carl was my boss at the movie 
                        theater I worked at once upon a 
                        time. He was a total prick. This 
                        is the third life that he’s worked 
                        for me. Karma’s a bitch, right?

                                 JEFF
                        You employ your old boss, so you 
                        can humiliate him?

                                 STUART
                        Genius, right? Gotta keep the old 
                        accounts balanced. Assholes from 
                        work... high school bullies... 
                                 (remembering)
                        Oh, I forgot to give you your 
                        cover stories. I’ve told everyone 
                        that you’re friends of mine from 
                        Cleveland. Jeff, you and I were 
                        best friends until your family 
                        moved in the 8th grade after your 
                        father lost all of his money and 
                        committed suicide.

                                 STUART (CONT'D)
                        And Pam, you and I dated a few 
                        years ago... purely physical 
                        stuff... Mutual break up... still 
                        friends. Got it?

           She shifts uncomfortably.

                                 STUART
                        Mustn’t let our little secret get 
                        out. Right? Right? You guys want 
                        some lunch? I want some lunch.  
                        How about some lunch?

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           Stuart’s at one end of an impossibly long table. Pam’s at 
           the other. Jeff’s in the middle. A banquet for 50 sits in 
           front of them. Grotesque amounts of food: lobster, steak, 
           potatoes, pasta, caviar, etc...

                                 PAM
                                 (re: banquet)
                        Is anyone else joining us?

                                 STUART
                        Hmmm? No. Why?

           Stuart has awful table manners. He eats with his hands, 
           picks his teeth. Two enormous dogs (PRESA CARNARIOS) are 
           at Stuart’s feet. Stuart throws hunks of steak and 
           lobster claws at the dogs, who hungrily devour them.

                                 PAM
                        Were you surprised when you saw 
                        the ad?

                                 STUART
                        Not at all, I’ve been aware of you 
                        both for a couple lifetimes now.

           Jeff and Pam look shocked.

                                 STUART
                        Oh please! Neither of you’s been 
                        exactly subtle... Mr. Future Inc. 
                        or Ms. Vitruvian Man... But I was 
                        willing to live and let live. That 
                        is until I discovered these...

           Stuart produces two stacks of newspapers from under the 
           table and plunks them down, shaking the table.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 STUART
                        I thought it was time we had a 
                        chat. After all, we don’t want 
                        people catching on... Right?

                                 PAM
                        But how else can we stop it?

                                 STUART
                        Stop what?

                                 PAM
                        Re-living.

                                 STUART
                        Are you kidding? Is she kidding? I 
                        can’t tell if she’s kidding. Why 
                        on earth would we want to stop it?

                                 PAM
                        Don’t you want to see the future?

                                 STUART
                        And give up all this? You know 
                        what they say, once you fly 
                        private, you can’t go first class.

                                 PAM
                        Once you’re dead, you can’t fly at 
                        all. In case you haven’t noticed, 
                        we’re coming back later and later.

                                 STUART
                        Who says we die? Maybe we reach 
                        the end, and go back to the 
                        beginning.

                                 PAM
                        I don’t wanna go back to the 
                        beginning.

                                 STUART
                        And therein lies the rub. If you 
                        figure out the end of the game, 
                        maybe we all stop playing. And I 
                        don’t wanna stop playing.

                                 PAM
                        This isn’t a game.

                                 STUART

                        See I wasn’t a fancy newscaster 
                        like you, Pam. And I didn’t have a 
                        big doctor wife like Jeff here. I 
                        was a projectionist at a movie 
                        theater. In Cleveland. I lived in 
                        my mother’s basement. I was one of 
                        life’s extras, until one day, I 
                        died. And when I woke up, I was 
                        the star. Because I knew the 
                        future, I could control my own 
                        destiny. But if you go and do 
                        something stupid like take an ad 
                        out or prevent the Kennedy 
                        Assassination, then once again I’m 
                        forced to deal with unknown 
                        variables and that’s just... 
                        unacceptable.

                                 JEFF
                        Nelson Bennett? You were behind 
                        that?

                                 STUART
                                 (small smile)
                        Guilty.
                                 (adding)
                        Look I was a big fan of JFK’s. But 
                        I don’t know the future in a world 
                        where the man doesn’t die. I had 
                        to intervene. We can’t allow our 
                        respective efforts to disrupt one 
                        another’s goals. Don’t you see? We 
                        3 are literally in a time-share.
                                 (calls out)
                        Carl, where’s the wine?

           Carl comes over and begins to pour.

                                 PAM
                        You set me up! You hired somebody 
                        to say that I was responsible for 
                        that plane crash!

                                 STUART
                        You left me no choice. Know what 
                        happens if anyone finds out about 
                        us? We end up on the wrong end of 
                        a microscope. Lab rats. Poked and 
                        prodded. Squeezed for information. 
                        I’m sorry, Pam.

           Pam gets up and starts to stalk toward Stuart. A large 
           man steps out of the shadows.

                                 STUART
                        You remember Nelson Bennett, don’t

                        I assure you, his manners are 
                        atrocious... and unlike me, he 
                        would hit a girl. He’s been my 
                        right arm every lifetime. Amazing 
                        what people will do for money.

           Pam, seething, stops.

                        Hey, I’ve got a swell idea, come 
                        with me to Graceland next week. 
                        Elvis is dying. I think it’ll be a

           Pam’s fuming, driving like a maniac. Jeff rides shotgun.

                        You and I were supposed to start a 
                        friendship in Mexico. Our wives 
                        become close, our kids go into a 
                        play group together.

                        I’ll stop you right there. My son 
                        is six, and hasn’t been in a play 
                        group in--

                        She’s the daughter you’re gonna 
                        have in about three years.

                                 HANK
                        Oh... I get it... You’re from the 
                        future. Well why didn’t you just 
                        say so. I think we got a form for 
                        that somewhere.

           Jeff hands him a piece of paper.

                        your superiors. Tell them, I’ll

                        You live on a base, we tell you 
                        what we know, and you tell us what 
                        you know. And it’s got to be more 
                        significant than a few terrorists 
                        taking over an embassy in Tehran.

           Pam gets off of the elevator and sees Linda (32) slipping 
           a piece of paper under the door.

           They sit awkwardly in the living room.

                                 LINDA
                        Sorry, I probably shouldn’t have 
                        come. I’m working nearby and...

                        We’re not actually divorced... But 
                        don’t worry, I haven’t seen him in

                                 PAM
                        I’m just a friend, crashing here.

                        That’s a relief. I kept picturing 
                        a woman holding baby answering the 
                        door... I dunno what I expected. 
                        Well that’s not true. I guess I 
                        expected him to come back.
                                 (then)
                        Look, would you mind giving him

                        Pride’s a funny thing. It stops

           EXT. COMPOUND - DAY - SEPTEMBER, 1980

           An expansive and well-guarded estate over-looking the 
           Potomac.

           INT. COMPOUND - DAY

           Hank’s walking down the hall, juggling a giant cell phone 
           and a cigarette.

                                 HANK
                        I gotta go. Tell Arnold and

                        see you all in a few days...

           Hank hangs up, stops at an open door, knocks out of 
           courtesy before entering--
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           A bedroom with bay windows on the Chesapeake. Pam packs a 
           suitcase. Jeff’s watches rain over the choppy bay.

                        Where are you two goin’?

           Jeff grabs the remote control, switches on the TV and 
           begins to flip through the channels, until...

           ON THE TV--

                        the death of President Gaddafi, 
                        and now threatens to envelope the

                                 JEFF
                        No. I think Gaddafi died of 
                        natural causes, just like Sadaam 
                        Hussein and Yasser Arafat.

           Pam closes the suitcase.

           They’re at the front door. Hank stands in front of them.

                        Please! You can’t!

           Pam moves Hank aside. He relents. She opens the door. A 
           large man standing in the doorway, blocks their egress.

                                 PAM
                        Would you please move?

           A second guard enters as if silently signaled. A third 
           stands on the staircase one hand poised before his gun.

           PULL BACK TO SEE WE ARE:

           EXT. BERKSHIRES - LATE AFTERNOON - 1977

           Jeff (32) is camping with Linda, (31) Hank (35) and 
           Jillian (32). Hank’s at the grill. Jeff tries to orient 
           himself.

                                 HANK
                                 (to Linda)
                        Better call the kids. Soup’s on.

                                 LINDA
                        Where are they?

           Suddenly it hits Jeff. The kids!

                                 JILLIAN
                        They went for a walk. But don’t 
                        worry, Arnie’s with ‘em.

                                 LINDA
                        CHLOE! WHITNEY! ARNOLD!  DINNER! 

                                 JEFF
                                 (remembering)
                        CHLOE!

           Jeff turns on a dime, takes off running!

                                 LINDA
                        Jeff, where are you--

           Jeff runs frantically through the woods, he trips on a 
           log, picks himself up! Keeps running, until finally he 
           comes to a river. Whitney (5) stands alone on the bank.

                                 WHITNEY
                        I told her not to go in.

           Arnold (12) breaches the surface of the water.

                                 ARNOLD
                        I can’t find her.

           Jeff dives in.

           After half a minute, Jeff breaks the surface with Chloe 
           (6) in his arms. Jeff gets her on land, performs CPR. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JEFF
                        Not again! Not again!
                                 (to Arnold)
                        Go get Linda!

           Jeff pumps Chloe’s chest and blows air into her lungs.

                                 JEFF
                        Please, baby. Please. I know I got 
                        there in time. I know I got there 
                        in time. Please. Please.

           Linda, Hank, Jillian and Arnold appear in the distance.

                                 LINDA
                        NO!

           Just then, Chloe coughs up water. Jeff looks up, tears in 
           his eyes.

                                 JEFF
                        She’s all right! She’s all right!

           He clutches her to his chest, kissing her. Crying.

           INT. ZATKOWSKI RESIDENCE - NIGHT - DECEMBER 21, 1988

           Linda Zatkowski cries. The tv’s tuned to Jeff. She picks 
           up the phone.

                                 LINDA
                                 (into the phone)
                        I have to go to him, Hank. I need 
                        to see him.

                                 JEFF (PRELAP)
                        Can I ask you a question?

           INT. CAFE VIAND - DAY - 1977

           Pam sitting alone in a booth looks up from her book.

                                 PAM
                        Wrong tree.

                        advice.

                        I’ve been waiting for this woman 
                        to... come back... from... 
                        holiday...  so I can say goodbye.

                                 PAM
                        Okay, so?

                                 JEFF
                        Well, part of me wants to just 
                        leave a note explaining it all.

                                 PAM
                        Great romance?

                                 JEFF
                        No. But I think for awhile we 
                        saved each other.

                                 PAM
                        And now...

                                 JEFF
                        I’m going back to my wife.

                                 PAM
                        Oh, buddy. Do her a favor, leave 
                        the note. Be brutal. Quicker the 
                        band aid’s off, quicker the wound 
                        heals. And trust me, I know from 
                        experience, I’m usually the one 
                        who leaves.

           Off Pam, smiling--

           A group of 25 kids and parents huddle around Chloe (11).

           Jeff (37) and Linda (36) watch as she blows out her ten 
           candles on the 30 cupcakes.

                        got presents for all of you.

           Linda comes in on a horse-drawn wagon carrying gifts.

                        Mr. Zatkowski. That’d be cheating.

                                 CHLOE
                        Don’t tell him.

                                 STUART
                                 (to Chloe)
                        I won’t.

                                 JEFF
                        Stuart, she has nothing to do with 
                        this... I’ll do whatever you want.

                                 STUART
                        That’s a great idea. When do you 
                        think you’ll drop by for a visit?

           Chloe smiles, nods.

                                 STUART
                        And do me a favor.... we’re in the 
                        boonies, so why don’t you bring us 
                        the news?

                                 JEFF
                        Pam?

                                 STUART
                        Of course.
                                 (then)
                        I’ll let Chloe know you said 
                        goodnight. See you soon.

           Linda enters the kitchen carrying grocery bags. Stuart 
           hangs up the phone.

                                 LINDA
                        How was your--

           Jeff drops the phone, runs out of the kitchen!

           INT. JEFF’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Jeff drives. Pam rides shotgun.

                                 JEFF
                        You know, you don’t have to come? 
                        I could--

                                 PAM
                        Pull over.

                                 JEFF
                        Huh?

                                 PAM
                        PULL OVER!

           Jeff pulls over to the shoulder.

                                 JEFF
                        You wanna get out?

                                 PAM
                        No. I wanna drive. We’ll get there 
                        faster.
           INT. BUNK - CAMP PONTIAC - NIGHT

           Chloe wakes up. Stuart’s standing over her.

                                 STUART
                        Shhhh... Are you ready?

                        Color war?

           Stuart nods, chloroforms Chloe with a handkerchief.

           EXT. CAMP PONTIAC - NIGHT

           It’s a crime scene. Police. Police dogs. A search party 
           is walking arm and arm through the woods with headlights.

           INT. ADMIN. OFFICE - NIGHT

           Pam’s talking with one of the camp’s ADMINS and THE 
           SHERIFF. Jeff’s on the phone with Linda.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t have time to explain. I’m 
                        gonna find her. She’s gonna be ok. 
                        Trust me. Get a hold of Hank. Tell 
                        him to put out an APB on Stuart 
                        McGowan. He’s from Cleveland.

                                 PAM
                        What are you saying? She 
                        disappeared into thin air?

                        Call me missy one more time, and 
                        I’ll--

           Something off-screen gets Pam’s attention.

                                 PAM

           CONTINUED:

           A picture of Stuart McGowan tacked to the wall. He’s 
           standing in front of a cabin. Jeff’s cabin.

           INT. JEFF’S CABIN - DAY, 1984

           Chloe wakes up. Stuart’s smiling at her, sitting next to 
           her on the bed.

                                 CHLOE
                        Where are we?

           Stuart strokes her hair, smiles.

           PRELAP: THE RUMBLE OF AN ENGINE

           EXT. CASCADE MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY - 1984

           A seaplane lands on the lake.

           EXT. DOCK - DAY

           Jeff and Pam get out onto the dock, and run to the cabin 
           in the distance.

           EXT. JEFF’S CABIN - DAY

           Jeff runs out of the cabin. Screaming!

                                 JEFF
                        CHLOE!!!!!!!! CHLOE!!!!!!

           His words echo. And then in the distance we hear...

                        Daddy!!!!! Daddy!!!!!

           CAMERA DOES A 360 as both Jeff and Pam try to track the 
           sound. Then Pam spots them.  

                                 PAM
                        They’re on Manny’s Peak!

           ANGLE on a distant peak. Jeff runs into the cabin and 
           then out again with binoculars.  

           JEFF POV: Stuart, another man and Chloe.

           Pam’s at the truck.

                        He wants us to come.

           EXT. MANNY’S PEAK - SAME

           Perched on the edge of a beautiful cliff with a 200 foot 
           drop sits Stuart. Chloe, in her nightgown trembling. In 
           the distance the truck makes rapid progress.

                                 STUART
                                 (to Chloe)
                        It’s almost over.

           INT. TRUCK - SAME

           The road’s bumpy and rough.

                                 PAM
                        We should wait for Hank.

           Jeff doesn’t slow down for a second.

           EXT. MANNY’S PEAK - SAME

           As Jeff and Pam approach, Stuart walks toward them.

                                 STUART
                        Welcome. Welcome.

           As they come closer they see Chloe. Carl stands next to 
           her with a hand on her shoulder, a gun at his side.

                                 STUART
                        You remember Carl.

                                 JEFF
                        Everything’s going to be all 
                        right, Chloe.
                                 (then)
                        What do you want, Stuart?

                        I want it back.

                                 STUART
                        The lifetime you stole from me so 
                        that you and Brenda Starr over 
                        there could get some answers.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t understand?

                                 STUART
                        I lost everything. I knew nothing. 
                        I had to survive by my wits. It 
                        didn’t work out very well. I lived 
                        like a rat. Carl turned on me. 
                        They all did. All because of you. 
                        So the way I see it, you owe me a 
                        lifetime.
                                 (re: Chloe)
                        Or a life.

                                 JEFF
                        She’s all I have.

                                 STUART
                        You started a World War. Do you 
                        know how many lives were lost? So 
                        what’s one more?
                                 (adding)
                        They’re not even real. It all just 
                        resets. They just come back.

                                 JEFF
                        Not her, Stuart... I saved her.

                                 STUART
                        No. No one was saved.

           THWIP! Carl’s shot. He falls down.

           Suddenly, an FBI helicopter appears over the ridge.

           Chloe runs into Jeff’s arms. Jeff runs for Chloe but then 
           another shot. And Pam goes down. Shot dead.

                                 JEFF
                        PAM!

           From a neighboring cliff we see a spec of a man holding a 
           rifle.

                                 STUART
                        You remember Nelson Bennett. You 
                        met at the house. He’s quite the 
                        sharp shooter.

           Jeff runs at Stuart and tackles him. They’re fighting and 
           rolling in the snow. The sharp shooter on the helicopter 
           can’t tell them apart.

           ANGLE ON: Chloe. Her eyes widen as Jeff and Stuart get 
           closer and closer to the edge of the cliff.

                                 CHLOE
                        DAD! WATCH OUT!

           ANGLE ON: THE HELICOPTER directly over Nelson Bennett. He 
           takes a shot at them, and they take him out.  

                                 STUART
                        Now, that’s a shame. He was so 
                        looking forward to meeting you.

           Stuart looks to the edge of the cliff.

                                 STUART
                                 (to Jeff)
                        Say goodbye to Chloe, darling.

           Before Jeff can react, Stuart hurls himself over the 
           cliff with Jeff in his clutches.

           Both bodies fall at terminal velocity, until...

           BLACK.

           Jeff’s driving a Volvo. An 18-wheeler heads right at him! 
           The wail of the air horn and Hank’s scream wakes him up 
           enough to jerk the wheel, and send them into a tree!

           Both men have minor head wounds.

           INT. ABC TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING - DECEMBER 21, 1988

           All the crew and staff sit jaw-dropped.

                        You said earlier that even if this 
                        story only exists in this lifetime 
                        you still want it to be known.
                                 (then)
                        Why?

                                 JEFF
                        To leave a legacy. Same as anyone 
                        else. I suppose we all leave 
                        footprints. Some people have 
                        children, some write poetry... 
                        some kill the president... some 
                        leave their names on buildings... 
                        some just carve their initials 
                        into bathroom stalls... I’ve done 
                        a few of those things at one time 
                        or another. I believe each of 
                        those worlds, for lack of a better 
                        term, that I’ve inhabited, has 
                        continued in my absence, and I 
                        like to think I’m still remembered 
                        in a few of them for who I was 
                        while I was there... But this... 
                        This was a chance to be remembered 
                        for all of it, to leave a more 
                        complete footprint in the sand.

           Pam, tears in her eyes, hugs him.

                                 JEFF
                        You’re back?

           EXT. BULLPEN - ABC STUDIOS - NIGHT DECEMBER 21, 1988

           Jeff exits with his hands in the air. Police surround him 
           and put him in handcuffs.

           EXT. ABC TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT - 1988

           Jeff’s brought out onto the street. Reporters are jamming 
           their microphones in his face. Jeff sees Hank.

                                 HANK
                        We’ll get you help, buddy.

           The crowd parts: Linda runs to Jeff. Pam steps away.

                                 LINDA
                        Chloe?

                        I love you--

                        I--

           BANG! Jeff spins.

           SLO MO everyone turns to the lone gunman. A familiar 
           face. Jeff’s eyes look surprised. Then bemused.

                                 JEFF

           The busty redhead removes her blouse exposing ample 
           bosom. Jeff replays, pushes her off of him.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        I had 35 minutes to live.

           The redhead tumbles from the car. The car leaves her in

                        I had to tell her, what I’d 
                        finally realized.

           EXT. VOLVO - NIGHT

           Traffic on the highway. Jeff drives on the shoulder.  
           Speeding.

           EXT. ZATKOWSKI HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jeff pulls up. Car still running, he races to the door.  
           Shit it’s locked. He has no keys. He bangs on it.

                                 JEFF
                        LINDA!!!! LINDA!!!!!! IF I COULD 
                        DO IT ALL AGAIN, I’D CHOOSE--

           He collapses. Linda opens the door.

           He dies.

           Jeff Replays again, the phone is already to his ear.

                        ...need--

           Jeff’s dies.

           Jeff’s stuck in a cycle of waking and dying, awareness 
           and void, alternating faster than he can perceive. 

                                 LINDA
                        We need. We need. We need. We

                        We need. We need. We need.

           Until finally...

                        It’s either a billion degrees or 
                        it’s freezing.

           Beat.

                                 LINDA
                        Hello?

           Soaked with perspiration he breathes his first breath of 
           the future.

                                 JEFF
                        Hello.  

           He closes his eyes as tears stream down his face.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        And in the end, it was a hiccup, a 
                        missed heartbeat. Had it even 
                        happened? Was any of it real?
           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY - 1989

           Jeff stands in front of a grave stone:

                        Stuart McGowan was. Once. He had 
                        died six months before me in a 
                        projectionist’s booth in downtown 
                        Cleveland... Had I read his obit 
                        somewhere, and in the moment 
                        between life and death inserted 
                        him into my fantasy? And Pam--

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET -VILLAGE - EVENING 1991

           Pam waits outside a Gristedes. A man comes out with a bag 
           of diapers. Reveal he’s wearing a Baby Bjorn. He puts his 
           arm around her and they walk hand in hand.

           PULL BACK TO SEE WE ARE WATCHING THIS FROM JEFF’S POV.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Was she just a manifestation of 
                        everything I thought I’d wanted? 
                        It didn’t matter. Everything was 
                        as it should be.

                                                                  CUT TO:

                        me.

           Everyone applauds. He closes the book.

           INT. BOOK STORE - EVENING - LATER

           Jeff’s at a desk. A line of fans wait for their copies of 
           REPLAY to be signed.

           Linda brings him coffee. A reporter close by stands with 
           a mini recorder. 

                                 REPORTER
                        The book’s a phenomenon, Mrs.

                        your husband marrying different 
                        women in each lifetime?

                        As long as I have him in this one, 
                        that’s all that counts.

           Linda kisses Jeff. Everyone laughs.

           Jeff looks away for a moment, sees:

           PAM through the window, standing outside. She smiles and 
           waves. He looks surprised, he waves back. A bus swipes 
           the screen and once it passes, Pam’s gone. He takes a 
           moment, then goes back to signing books as we...
