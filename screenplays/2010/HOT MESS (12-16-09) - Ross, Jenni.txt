           OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE INTRO TO “LITTLE GREEN BAG” BY THE 
           GEORGE BAKER SELECTION (ICONIC INTRODUCTION TO RESERVOIR 
           DOGS). 

                                                                COLD OPEN:

           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY/FLASHBACK

           Four, eleven year old girls, strut confidently across the 
           playground wearing sunglasses, a’la Reservoir Dogs.  
           Other kids move out of their way.

           BEGIN TITLE SEQUENCE OVER MONTAGE:

           The four girls come to the aid of another kid being 
           bullied by an older boy on the playground; they TP 
           someone’s house by the light of the moon, laughing 
           uncontrollably; they throw their hands high in the air on 
           a roller coaster, screaming; they start a food fight in 
           the cafeteria and are hauled into detention; the girls 
           play kickball and kick ass.  Kelly tags a boy with the 
           ball as she slides onto the base.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Welcome to my halcyon days. A 
                        simpler time when math homework 
                        didn’t require a calculator and 
                        your underwear still covered your 
                        ass.

           They raise their hands in class, unashamed that they know 
           the answer.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Back then my friends and I were on 
                        top of the pre-pubescent world.  
                        We were happy to be ourselves and 
                        no amount of Britney Spears  
                        videos or American Apparel ads 
                        could convince us otherwise. 

           The girls walk by a large print ad for Guess Jeans - 
           Raven zips back into the shot and defaces the model by 
           “crossing her eyes” with a Sharpie.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT/FLASHBACK

           11 YEAR OLD Sydney helps her mother set the table.

           INT. GIRL SCOUT BASE - DAY

           Sydney distributes cupcakes to the troupe.

                        Sydney was always a natural people 
                        pleaser.  Some would argue a kiss-
                        ass, but she was totally genuine - 
                        like the love child of Charlotte 
                        York and Rachel Ray.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY/FLASHBACK

           11 YEAR OLD RAVEN gets the attention of a group of boys.  

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Raven was a natural beauty.  The 
                        girl boys liked before they knew 
                        they liked girls.

           As one of the boys turns to watch her pass, he accidently 
           slams his face into an open locker door.

           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY/FLASHBACK

           11 YEAR OLD KELLY stands in a quadrant of a foursquare 
           court.  She’s staring up at the clouds with a faraway 
           look on her face.  

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        And Kelly was the dreamer.  She 
                        had the right brain of Picasso and 
                        the left brain of Harvey Levin.

           KELLY’S POV: a cloud takes the shape of ZAC EFRON’S FACE.  
           She smiles dreamily until - WHACK!  The ball hits her in 
           the head.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Look alive, Kel!

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        And then there was me.

           INT. ALEXIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT/FLASHBACK

           11 YEAR OLD ALEXIA meticulously arranges her bulletin 
           board (photos, movie stubs, posters, etc.).

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        I’d always rejected the term “anal 
                        rententive”. Instead I preferred 
                        to think of myself as “on top of 
                        my shit.”
           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY/FLASHBACK

           Alexia’s POV: a “TO DO” list; “1. Algebra, chapter five, 
           2. Civics workbook pages 67-82”, etc.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        I was a born list maker.  Besides 
                        giving me a sense of control, 
                        lists had always helped me to 
                        achieve my goals, scholastic or 
                        otherwise.  Observe the otherwise.  

           INT. RAVEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Raven’s parents go out, her grandmother left in charge.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Raven’s parents were basically 
                        normal except for the fact that 
                        they were effing crazy. They 
                        trusted no one with Raven and 
                        Raven with no one, except for -

           CLOSE UP on a GRAMMIE, a scary, elderly Nazi type.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        - Grammie.  Or, as we referred to 
                        her, ‘Heil Grammie.’

                                 GRAMMIE
                        SITZEN MACHEN!

           The girls sit in one synchronous movement.  And quick.

           INT. RAVEN’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Alexia makes a list titled, “Ways to Shake Grammie”.  

           INT. RAVEN’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Raven pours NyQuil into a mug.  

                                 ALEXIA
                                 (to the girls)
                        Ready?

           They nod.  Alexia plants a spider on the wall and then 
           SCREAMS. As Raven’s Grandmother gets up to kill the bug, 
           Kelly switches out the mug of tea. Sydney changes the 
           channel to QVC and then steals the TV remote.

           SHORT TIME LAPSE: Grammie SNORES in front of QVC.

                        From that day on, my friends 
                        always came to me for help and 
                        advice and I was happy to play 
                        that role.

           The girls stifle their laughter as they quietly sneak out 
           the back door, TP in tow.

           INT. ALEXIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT/FLASHBACK

           The CAMERA SLOWLY PUSHES INTO Alexia’s bedroom, past the 
           “NO BOYS ALLOWED” sign on the door, past the girls 
           sitting around in their PJ’s eating ice cream...and close 
           ON ALEXIA’S CONFIDENT, SMILING FACE.

                                 ALEXIA
                        It was a time when you dreamt 
                        about your first period like 
                        people dream about winning the 
                        lottery or peace in Israel. 
                                 (beat)
                        But then we stopped dreaming.  For 
                        three reasons. Boobs. And boys.  
                        Do the math. 

                                                             CUT TO BLACK:

           OVER BLACK. SILENCE.

                        And once boys were in the picture, 
                        let it be known: there would never 
                        be peace again.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. BIRCH FALLS HIGH SCHOOL/HALLWAY - DAY

           The camera zig zags down the hall, avoiding students at 
           every turn.  It’s fast paced, chaotic and more sexualized 
           in tone.  We’re not in middle school anymore, Toto.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        By our junior year in high school, 
                        we had morphed into mystifying 
                        versions of the people we used to 
                        be.  

           The camera FREEZES on SYDNEY - rotating around her 3-
           D/Matrix style. She’s standing at her locker talking to 
           another student, smiling brightly. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Sydney had devolved from a people-
                        pleaser to a virtual shape 
                        shifter.  She had become the 
                        teenage equivalent of a mood ring 
                        but with amazing hair and personal 
                        stationary.  To illustrate, enter 
                        Drew.

           INT. BIRCH FALLS HIGH SCHOOL/HALLWAY - DAY

           Watch DREW walk down the hall in SLOW MOTION. Tall, good 
           looking, grounded. He clearly commands respect and 
           genuine affection from everyone he passes.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Drew easily appealed to Sydney as 
                        the perfect guy. He was athletic, 
                        popular and smelled like dessert.

           Drew grins as Sydney makes her way into the frame.  He 
           puts his arm around her and they walk together.

           EXT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY

           Sydney and Drew make their way up a steep hiking trail 
           with Drew leading the way.  He’s grinning, loving nature.  
           Sydney is sweaty, dirty and not into it. 

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        A people pleaser by nature, Sydney 
                        went into overdrive when it came 
                        to Drew. 

           She sees a large insect and nearly faints.

           INT. MALL - DAY

           As Sydney passes J-Crew she slows down and begins to 
           drool a little.  She forces herself to snap out of it, 
           and wills herself into Urban Outfitters.

           INT. SYDNEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sydney is surrounded by shopping bags - Urban Outfiters, 
           Free People, Nanette Lepore, etc.  She’s trying to 
           convince herself that this is actually her style.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        She didn’t realize she was giving 
                        all her power away.

                        She figured it was just a loan.  
                        Besides, if Drew was happy, she 
                        was happy.  And his happiness gave 
                        her power.  Twisted, but true. 

           Sydney looks in the mirror and holds up a fringe jacket.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Luckily she could pull off fringe 
                        without looking homeless.

           INT. DREW’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Sydney (rocking her bohemian look) and Drew play Rock 
           Band, with Sydney at the drums (sucking).  

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Even if she was never really 
                        herself around him, and even if 
                        they didn’t share any common 
                        interests, Sydney still loved the 
                        way it felt being Drew Henry’s 
                        girlfriend.

           INT. BIRCH FALLS HIGH SCHOOL/HALLWAY - DAY

           Sydney and the other student are where we left them.  
           UNFREEZE.

                        We’re going rock climbing this 
                        weekend.  We love it.

           RAVEN walks by and catches that last bit. 

                                 RAVEN
                                 (without stopping)
                        You mean Drew loves it.  You love 
                        to watch horror movies and inhale 
                        Crunch n’ Munch.

           She winks and slaps Sydney on the ass as she passes.  
           Follow Raven about two feet as an approaching FRESHMAN 
           BOY catches a glimpse of her and walks face first into an 
           open locker.  

           She smirks but doesn’t flinch.  FREEZE - rotate 3-
           D/Matrix style.

                        Raven, on the other hand, hadn’t 
                        changed much. Once a hottie, 
                        always a hottie.

                        We referred to her as Raven 2.0. 
                        The fact that she never went 
                        through the requisite Ugly 
                        Duckling phase like the rest of 
                        humanity didn’t win her too many 
                        girlfriends other than the three 
                        of us.  

           UNFREEZE. We follow Raven down the hall as every passing 
           girl sneers and every passing boy drools.

                        However, I don’t think it kept her 
                        up at night.

           QUICK SHOTS: Raven and HOT BOY #1 make out behind the 
           bleachers; HOT BOY #2 texts Raven something in class; 
           Raven helps HOT BOY #3 sneak into her bedroom window.  
           FREEZE on the two of them in Raven’s bedroom.

                        Girls like Raven never get lonely.  
                        They always have boyfriends and go 
                        through them like babies go 
                        through butt wipes. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD/STADIUM - NIGHT

           The crowds go insane as CALEB scores a touchdown and wins 
           the game. As his teammates lift him onto their shoulders, 
           he finds Raven in the crowd and waves to her.  She 
           returns the favor by flashing her (obscured) tits at him. 
           He grins but the woman next to her is appalled.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Her latest, Caleb, a senior and 
                        the starting quarterback, seemed 
                        like a pretty good match at first.

           INT. CALEB’S CAR - NIGHT

           Raven and Caleb are having a heated argument. It reaches 
           a climax as Raven SLAPS Caleb hard across the face. 
           Suddenly they dive for each other, kissing passionately 
           as they awkwardly climb into the backseat.  

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        But therein lies the rub. Since 
                        Caleb was like the male version of 
                        Raven, it was only a matter of 
                        time before the shit hit the fan.

           CONTINUED:

           They argue. Raven gets out and slams the door.  He runs 
           after her

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Said simply, there wasn’t enough 
                        room for so much hotness in one 
                        relationship.  Which is why things 
                        got rocky, fast.  Hot.  But rocky.  
                               (beat)

           INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING

           Raven, dressed like an innocent angel, sits with her 
           family.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        And here’s the real kicker -
                                 (beat)
                        Raven’s not allowed to date.  
                        Ever.  Or until she turns 18.  
                        Whichever comes first.  So we’ve 
                        been covering for her ever since 
                        the first boy in our class got a 
                        boner. 

           Just for kicks, Raven winks at the PRIEST. He blushes.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        There’s been a lot of boners since 
                        then.

           INT. BIRCH FALLS HIGH SCHOOL/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Back to Raven walking down the hall.  She spots KELLY up 
           ahead, giggling with some other students.  Kelly tries to 
           wave to Raven and ends up dropping her stuff and spilling 
           coffee all over herself. Raven bends down to help.

                        And Kelly. Kelly was pudgy, 
                        earnest and clueless: the trifecta 
                        of teenage pathos.  
           INT. KELLY’S FAMILY ROOM - DAY

           Kelly, Drew, her brother TODD, and about ten other boys 
           watch a football game.  

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        She was also a real ‘guys’ girl’,  
                        constantly hanging out with her 
                        brother and his hot friends.  And 
                        they loved her.  I mean, who 
                        wouldn’t?  She was fun, easy 
                        going, and laughed at their ard-
                        tard jokes.  Huge, right?  Wrong. 
                        Because the irony is she never 
                        went for any of them.  Instead 
                        she’d go for the unattainable, the 
                        inaccessible, and the ‘what were 
                        you thinking?’ 
                                 (beat)
                        Case in point: her freshmen year 
                        crush.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Kelly stands next to WILL as he pays for their popcorn; 
           but when she reaches for his hand as they walk to their 
           seats, he casually avoids it.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        She had been obsessed with a 
                        metrosexual jerker named Will 
                        Bergman who was clearly one piece 
                        of melon short of a fruit salad.  
                        But she didn’t seem to notice. Or 
                        care.

                                 WILL
                        ...seriously, nothing’s harder 
                        than getting a latte stain out of 
                        white linen. 

           Kelly looks more confused than supportive.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        It was like watching a Juicy 
                        Couture lamb march herself to 
                        slaughter.

                        Since that time she had had a 
                        handful of hard core crushes that 
                        were not only obvious disasters, 
                        but served to fatally damage her 
                        self image.  So we were skeptical 
                        when she told us - 

                                 KELLY
                        This is the guy.

                        Saturday. We’re ‘working’ on 
                        something at his house. 
                                 (pausing for affect)
                        And his parents will definitely

                        But the truth was, we always did.  
                        We feared that this time her 
                        secret crush might be that senior 
                        with premature ear hair who’d been

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        And it didn’t help matters that 
                        any time I saw a guy who was 
                        remotely cute my bowels would 
                        twitch.

           As she passes a CUTE GUY, she cringes slightly and grabs 
           her abdomen.  He notices.  She’s mortified.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Just to be fair, it’s not that I 
                        was seventeen and had never been 
                        asked out -

           A really not-so-cute RANDOM BOY stops Alexia.  

                                 RANDOM BOY
                        Hey, Alexia!

                                 ALEXIA
                        Hi.

                        So I was thinking, maybe we could 
                        go to a movie Friday night?

                                 ALEXIA
                        Oh, I’d love to but...

                        I wanted to go out with.

           INT. ALEXIA’S KITCHEN - MORNING

           Alexia is venting her fears to an unknown listener.

                                 ALEXIA
                        - what if I’m so freaking picky 
                        that by the time I do pick 
                        someone, all that’s left is a 
                        lemon?  Like, what if for some 
                        reason my expectations are 
                        unnaturally high, but I can’t tell 
                        because all I’m responding to is a 
                        biological instinct instead of a 
                        rational one?  
                                 (gasps)
                        What if my pheromones are leading 
                        me straight toward a life of 
                        loneliness, or worse, the suburbs?

           afraid of their progeny.

                        What’s wrong with suburbs?

           Alexia puts her head on the table, “they just don’t get 
           it.” Her father turns to her mother.

           Alexia sits in the back of a classroom that’s been 
           converted into a newsroom.  She’s clearly expectant.

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL GYMNAIUM - DAY/FLASHBACK

           A Halloween costume contest is in progress.

                        I’d had a thing for Ben since we 
                        were nine and he showed up for 
                        Halloween dressed as a Rubik’s 
                        Cube.  My fate was sealed.  

           Ben, trapped in a colorful box with his arms stuck at 
           ninety degree angles, awkwardly makes his way on stage

                        And true to form, he grew up not 
                        only to be the man of my dreams, 
                        but most of the female population 
                        of Birch Falls.  And some of the 
                        males, too.

           BIRCH FALLS HIGH SCHOOL/HALLWAY - PRESENT DAY

           Ben walks down the hall. Girls check him out left and 
           right. So do a few guys.

                        I’d like to lay claim to him - 
                        after all I saw him first.  But 
                        life doesn’t work on the dibs 
                        system.  And he was a bit of an

                        She thought he was boring so it 
                        only lasted like, a week. This

                        about them together still makes my

                        might rip the fabric of space 
                        time.  Needless to say, I never

                        about my love for Ben Daniels,

           A hopeful Kelly, tarted up like she’s going to a Vegas 
           night club, rings the doorbell.

           The person who answers the door is not a boy, but rather, 
           MR. HALL (30 and GORGEOUS), her drama teacher.

                                 MR. HALL
                        Kelly, welcome!  Did you bring a

                        own.  I hope that’s alright.  I 
                        just felt that if all this is 
                        about peeling back the layers -

                        -this will show you my core, Tony.

           He’s not quite sure what she means and politely ignores 
           her cleavage which she’s thrust into him.

           INT. MR. HALL’S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

           She walks in confidently and bats her eyelashes.

                        Simple.  Elegant. 

           She holds up a bottle of wine, beaming.

                        I brought some red.

                        Oh, Kelly, hey!  I thought you 
                        were the pizza.

           Kelly turns around.  Behind her in the family room about 
           a dozen classmates are sprawled on the floor.

           She’s beyond horrified.

           Drew has driven them to Craig’s house.  As Sydney gets 
           out of the car (really looking awful, by the way), she 
           sees a small clan of totally decked out girls.

           Sydney is becoming increasingly anxious as people make 
           their way into the party and size up her appearance.

           House party in the basement.  RG#4 is alone at the keg 
           when RB#4 approaches. 

                                 RB#4
                        So how have you been?  I haven’t 
                        seen much of you since you and 
                        Jeremy broke up.

           RG#4 is already shit canned.  She throws her full cup on 
           the ground and dives for him.

           RG#5 is standing next to her best friend, RG#A, as RB#5 
           (clearly the ex-boyfriend) walks by.  He and RG#5 nod 
           politely at each other, but when he thinks the coast is 
           clear, he winks at the best friend, who winks back.

           RG#5 sees the exchange and GASPS.  She turns to her BFF.

                        wait for the Rapture or universal 
                        health care, but it was just a

                        have the balls to actually do

           for her to say something. Finally she turns and leaves.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Raven is impassive as she makes her way to her desk on 
           which sits a HUGE vase of red roses.  She glances over at 
           Caleb who’s grinning ear to ear.  She pulls out a single 
           rose and saunters over.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        While Raven may have been doing a 
                        kick ass job following the rules, 
                        her motivation seemed to be less 
                        about personal empowerment and 
                        more about dominating the opposite 
                        sex.  Namely, Caleb. Now they were 
                        engaged in some sort of sick, sex-
                        tug-of-war, and it seemed like the 
                        fact that they weren’t ‘seeing’ 
                        each other was bringing them 
                        closer together than they were 
                        when they were actually together.

                        together.  I mean, you’re so hot.

           She smiles coyly and drags the tip of the rose down his 
           chest provocatively.

           He reaches down and hands her a Harry Potter lunch box 
           with a bow on it.  Her face burns red.  In a good way.

                        As for me, I’d completely given up 
                        on Ben.  I wasn’t supposed to be 
                        dating anyway and as far as I 
                        could tell, he now tolerated me as 
                        perhaps a high functioning 
                        borderliner so I figured I should 
                        just quit while I was ahead.

                        Sweetheart, you’re actual. You 
                        don’t need those rules.  They’re 
                        for the uglies and the fatties and 
                        the lezzies -

                        Hold up.  Those rules are for 
                        anyone who cares enough to respect 
                        themselves.

           Ben looks surprised and intrigued.  This is the first 
           coherent thing she’s ever said in his presence.

                        I mean... well...there’s nothing 
                        wrong with a girl wanting to make 
                        herself or her self esteem a 
                        priority.

                        Guys never seem to have a problem

                        And furthermore, as far as I can 
                        tell, those rules are absolutely 
                        not anti-male.  Why is it that any 
                        time a woman feels empowered, guys 
                        automatically think she’s a man-

                        OK. So this is one of those 
                        moments when you have to weigh 
                        love against fear.  To the right 
                        of me -
                                 (angle on Ben)
                        - we have love.  In front of me -
                                 (angle on the stage)
                        - we have fear.

                        You see for me, public speaking 
                        let alone public singing is 
                        analogous to taking a steaming 
                        dump on national television, which 
                        is undoubtably what would happen 
                        if I were asked to sing on 
                        national television.  The only 
                        reason I was at a karaoke bar was 
                        because the last Friday of every 
                        month the Herald staff holds a 
                        karaoke night, and Ben invited me 
                        personally.  So when Ben said -

           UNFREEZE.

                                 BEN
                        I signed us up for a duet.

                        I’d sooner poke myself in the eye 
                        with a dry toothpick.  

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That’s how afraid I was of public 
                        humiliation.  I actually said no 
                        to dream man.

                        OK, next up we have Ben and
                        Alexia.

           The other kids cheer them on.  She looks ashen.

                                 OWNER (CONT’D)
                        C'mon Ben and Alexia, let's go!
                        Round of applause everyone!

           Everyone applauds and cheers but Alexia, who could hork 
           at any moment, looks up at Ben and whispers -

                                 ALEXIA
                        Please save me.

           His face softens; she got to him. He winks at her and the 
           color starts to find its way back to her features. Ben 
           jumps onto the stage.

                                 BEN

                        this song to overcoming personal
                        phobias!

           The song starts: "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" by The 
           Proclaimers. Ben begins to sing and dance - with a full 
           Irish brogue - in that ridiculously, goofy, sexy way that 
           only the class clown can. He's delectable. He jumps off 
           the stage and sings right in Alexia's face.  She could 
           shit, cum or pass out at any second.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        I couldn’t tell which end was up.  
                        Was he flirting with me?  Just 
                        being friendly?  Didn’t care.  For 
                        the first time I saw an opening 
                        and I went for it, rules be 
                        damned!

           SHORT MUSIC MONTAGE:  Alexia begins to unravel as the 
           real version of the song plays.

           INT. ALEXIA’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Alexia drools over Ben’s facebook page.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        I made the usual first time 
                        mistakes, only I made them all at 
                        once.

           INT. NEWSPAPER CLASS - DAY

           A dopey-eyed Alexia hands Ben a proofed article.  He 
           thanks her and squeezes her shoulder.  She melts.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        But to be fair I had a lot of 
                        catching up to do.  Normally this 
                        type of totally undignified and 
                        desperate behavior is spread over 
                        years, starting at around twelve.

           INT. ALEXIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Pan across Alexia’s bedroom which is starting to resemble 
           a frat house.  Alexia rushes in, throws her bag across 
           the room, dials Ben’s number -

                        take it away -

           - aaaand hangs up.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        For me it’s always been all or 
                        nothing.  Either I’m a pillar of 
                        control and dignity -

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Alexia tries to stay cool as she spots Ben walking in the 
           hall.  He smiles warmly and gives her a dorky high five 
           as they pass.  She stumbles into a teacher.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Or I’m a lovelorn fiasco of 
                        biblical proportions.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           A teacher hands out a corrected essay.  C.  She gives 
           Alexia a worried glance.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           Alexia drives by Ben’s house.  Not home yet.  

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        And let’s not forget all the rules 
                        I was actually breaking here.  

           She swings around the block just in time to see his car 
           pull in.  She’s so distracted that she BANGS the car in 
           front of her, waiting at a stop sign.

           FREEZE on Alexia’s stunned expression.

           The following appear as RED TEXT with A HUGE RED “X” 
           across them.  The SFX sound like ANVILS as they SLAM onto 
           the screen, one right after another.

           DON’T STALK HIM

           DON’T CALL AND LISTEN TO OUTGOING MESSAGES

           DON’T CHASE AFTER A GUY WHO ISN’T INTERESTED

           CONTINUED:

           DON’T BE THE REBOUND GIRL

           UNFREEZE as Alexia hops out of the car to apologize.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Yes, it takes a special kind of 
                        asshole to unhinge with such 
                        pizzazz.

           END SONG.

           INT. SYDNEY'S CAR - NIGHT

           Sydney turns onto Kelly’s street and notices Drew’s car 
           in her driveway. She frowns.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        In my defense I’d like to point 
                        out that I wasn’t the only one 
                        falling off the wagon, knocking it 
                        over and setting it on fire.  
                        Observe Sydney.  

           Sydney sits in her car watching as Drew knocks on the 
           door.  Kelly answers and lets him in.

                                 ALEXIA (CONT’D)
                        No, your eyes are not deceiving 
                        you.  That is in fact Sydney 
                        watching Kelly let her ex, Drew, 
                        into her house.  But before you 
                        jump to conclusions let me fill 
                        you in on the back story.
                        You see, Drew and Kelly’s brother 
                        Todd have been besties since 
                        before they needed jock straps.  
                        So when Sydney was Drew’s go to 
                        girl, they used to go to Todd’s, 
                        because of course, that’s what 
                        Drew wanted to do. Obviously 
                        compared to scuba diving or some 
                        other recreational horror show 
                        activity, Todd’s house was 
                        infinitely more appealing, 
                        especially when Kelly was home.  
                        For Sydney it was totally a 
                        win/win.  Until she lost.

           INT.  SYDNEY’S ROOM - EVENING

           Sydney’s about to rip up a photo of she and Drew.  She 
           hesitates and puts it in a drawer instead.

                        Now that Sydney was no longer in 
                        the picture, she had to accept the 
                        fact that Drew would be going to 
                        Todd and Kelly’s without her.
                        And often.  Obviously this put 
                        Kelly in a crappy position.  Not 
                        only did the rules specifically 
                        mandate that you shouldn’t give 
                        your friends updates on their 
                        exes, but now Kelly was 
                        inadvertently spending more time 
                        with Drew than Drew spent with 
                        Sydney when they were together!

           INT. MALL - DAY

           Sydney looks longingly into the window of a sporting 
           goods store.

                                 SYDNEY
                        I mean, he’s practically living 
                        there.

                        Try not to think about him.

           Kelly runs up.

                                 KELLY
                        Hey, sorry I’m late.  Todd has the 
                        car today.

                                 SYDNEY
                                 (can’t help herself)
                        Was he alone?

           Kelly’s taken off guard.

                                 SYDNEY (CONT’D)
                        Was he?  Wait, don’t tell me.  No - 
                        God!  I can’t take this anymore!

           Sydney stalks off.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Because not only did Kelly see 
                        Drew, like four times a week - 

           INT. KELLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Kelly walks down the hall in her boxer pj’s.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        - but half the time he was just a 
                        bedroom away. 

           She and Drew shove each other affectionately.  Like 
           siblings.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And speaking from my newfound 
                        perspective on love and men, that 
                        would drive me effing bazonky.

           EXT. KELLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Back to Sydney sitting in front of Kelly’s house.  She 
           pulls out her cell phone and dials.

           INT. KELLY’S BASEMENT - INTERCUT

           Kelly is sitting at a poker table with Todd, Drew and 
           another guy.  Her mother enters and hands Kelly her cell.

                                 KELLY’S MOTHER
                        You left your phone in the 
                        kitchen.  It’s Sydney.

           Everyone at the table clams up.

                                 KELLY
                                 (uncomfortable)
                        Hey, Syd, what’s up?

                                 SYDNEY
                        So I just wanted to say sorry for 
                        tweeking out on you at the mall 
                        before.  I mean, it’s not your 
                        fault Drew and Todd are friends, 
                        right?  Like, I just have to 
                        remind myself that you’re not just 
                        like you know, hanging out, with 
                        him - he’s hanging out with your 
                        brother, right?

           Todd wants to start dealing again.

                                 KELLY
                        Right.
                                 (to the table,

                        OK, you’re going to do exactly

                        on a date.  Okay?

           Kelly laughs way too loudly.

                        That’s funny!  I can’t believe she 
                        said that.  Okay, well have fun on

                        and let me know how it goes.

           She hangs up, relieved.

           Sydney hangs up and looks at herself in the mirror, 
           crying as she pulls away.

           INT. KELLY’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Back to the card game.

                                 DREW
                        Does she have a date?

                        position.

           Kelly smiles gratefully.  Todd gets a text.

                                 TODD
                        Party at the U!  Let’s go.

           Everyone ad libs excitement.  Drew turns to Kelly.

                                 DREW
                        You in?

                        Party on a school night?  Yes!

           Drew laughs - he likes her enthusiasm.

                        We’ll wait while you change.

                        Raven was bending them - like

           Kelly and Drew are drinking when she spots Will talking 
           to a couple of guys across the room.  One of them puts 
           his hand on Will's ass.  Drew’s eyes go wide.

                        Clearly I have great taste in men.  
                        Evidently, so does he.

           Will spots them and waves.  Kelly waves back.

                                 DREW
                        Why did you go out with him?

                                 KELLY
                        I think the better question is why 
                        did he go out with me?   But it 
                        doesn’t matter.  Once I figured it 
                        out it was like the hugest relief 
                        EVER.

                        I think a lot of things.  Like 
                        maybe I turned him gay.

                                 DREW
                        OK, now you’re losing it. You did 
                        not turn him gay.  Same way I 
                        didn’t turn Sydney into a schizo.

                        down.  Non negotiable, OK?

           He nods and she seems satisfied.  Suddenly the song 
           changes. She jumps up and down.

           She pulls him onto the dance floor and really has at it.  
           Her dancing is natural and sexy in a sweet way.

                        was like, really bummed.

                        Hello, foreign exchange program.  

           Different day.

                        My fiance and I are planning our 
                        wedding for early next fall.  I'm 
                        fifteen, he's sixty-five and we've 
                        never met.  Do you think I could 
                        wear something from Vera Wang’s 
                        summer collection or is it too 
                        late in the season.

           Kelly and Raven GASP. 

           Sydney casually walks through the frame and answers.

                                 SYDNEY
                        Yes.

                        Even though our grades - and in 
                        Sydney and Kelly’s case, our 
                        friendships - were suffering, the 
                        site definitely wasn’t. Hot Mess 
                        had attracted over one million 
                        members worldwide.  We should have 
                        realized that it was becoming 
                        bigger than itself, but we were 
                        still just four teenagers trying 
                        to keep up with our homework while 
                        surreptitiously lusting after the 
                        boys we promised to abstain from.  
                        And that’s a heavy load, people.
           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Sydney watches as Drew cosies up to sexy Kaitlin.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Sydney sprints over to Drew as he gets into his car.  She 
           breaks down crying almost immediately. 

                                 DREW
                        What’s the matter?  What happened?

                                 SYDNEY
                                 (crying)
                        I just don’t understand how you 
                        could move on so quickly!  I want 
                        to get back together.  Fine.  I 
                        said it.  

           Drew is taken off guard.

                                 DREW
                                 (flustered)
                        Oh, Syd - I... I don’t know what 
                        to say here.

           She takes it as a “no”.  She gets mean.

                                 SYDNEY
                                 (curt)
                        Oh, really?  Shall I give you a 
                        hint?  How about, Yes, Sydney, I 
                        miss you madly.  These past three 
                        weeks without you have been pure 
                        hell, forcing me to spend time 
                        with punch clocks like Kaitlin and 
                        cows like Kelly!

           As soon as it’s out of her mouth they both freeze, 
           horrified.  He leans in closely.

                                 DREW
                                 (hisses)
                        You don’t hold a candle to Kelly.

           He gets in his car and slams the door. Sydney covers her 
           face; she has never felt so guilty in her entire life.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        That confirmed it.  Not only did 
                        Drew no longer have feelings for 
                        Sydney - 
           INT. KELLY'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Raven sits in front of Kelly’s computer, mouth agape.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        - but she inadvertently made him 
                        realize he had feelings for 
                        someone else.

           CLOSE ON a picture of Kelly.  PULL BACK to reveal we’re 
           watching an IMovie made with photos of Kelly and Mr. Hall 
           (most taken in Drama class) plays against “Hey There, 
           Delilah.”  The faces of the other students have been 
           blurred to really highlight their singular love.

           Kelly walks in to find Raven watching her IMovie.

                                 KELLY
                        WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  

           She turns it off but it’s too late.

                        Well, let’s see.  There were two 
                        DVDs.  One said, ‘For Your Eyes 
                        Only’.  The other said, ‘Kelly 
                        Monologue’.  Guess which one I 
                        chose?

                                 KELLY
                        You had no right!  That’s private!

           Kelly EJECTS it, puts it back in its case, and slips it 
           into her messenger bag.  Raven is horrified but laughing.

                                 KELLY
                        We’re in love with each other.

                        She went on to tell Raven about 
                        the trust exercises they had just 
                        done in class.

           INT. DRAMA CLASS - FLASHBACK

           The class stands in pairs falling back into each other’s 
           arms.  Kelly sits alone, awkwardly.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Mr. Hall stepped in -

                        I’ll be your trust partner, Kelly.

           We watch in SLOW MOTION as Kelly falls back into his 
           arms.  Orgasmic.

                        And they trusted each other all 
                        afternoon during a little exercise 
                        called ‘What I See in Your Face’.

           They sit Indian style, knees touching.

                                 KELLY/MR. HALL
                        Love, youth, warmth, hope, 
                        yearning, compassion, soul....

                        In the end they compromised. Raven 
                        promised not to tell anyone about 
                        McFaculty, if Kelly promised not

                        - messenger bag!

           In SLOW MOTION we see Brian’s hand land on “For Your Eyes 
           Only”. Mr. Hall starts up the DVD player attached to a 
           flat screen TV.  Kelly sits up front.

                                 MR. HALL
                        Let’s get started  First up -

                        ‘For Your Eyes Only’. Kelly Weiss! 

           FREEZE on Kelly’s face:

                        Despite her apparent naivete, 
                        Kelly was always good in a pinch.  
                        Today was no different.

           UNFREEZE.

           She takes her shoe off and throws it, SHATTERING the TV 
           screen.  The class STARTS and GASPS.

                        And that, was ‘for your eyes 
                        only’.  Thank you.

           BEAT. She bows. And then hobbles out. One kid applauds.

                        Okay, not exactly smooth, but who 
                        among us could have done better?  
                        We were all being tested with wake

                        In my case, it was my first D.  A 
                        ‘D’.  ME.  It was like, fifth 
                        dimension surreal.  What was going 
                        on with me?  Who was this hot mess 
                        I was becoming?  I needed to pull 
                        it together.  And fast.

           INT. ALEXIA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Alexia barrels in and throws off her coat.  In quick 
           shots we see her: cleaning her room, doing laundry, 
           Ajaxing her bathtub, filing paperwork, catching up with 
           her homework, etc.  Finally she gets into bed with a 
           towel on her head.  She feels better already.

                        Then I checked my calender.

           “Hey! Don’t forget it’s Ben Daniels’ birthday tomorrow!”

           INT. NEWSPAPER CLASS - DAY

           Ben’s impromptu birthday party.  Alexia hands out pieces 
           of an elaborate, homemade, white cake.  Ben sidles over.

           off a fork-full - and tries to feed her.

           Her embarrassment only serves to crack him up.  He tries 
           again.

                        EAT IT!

           She shrieks and starts to move away, giggling, but he 
           outmanuevers her and shoves a chunk in her face.

           She’s stunned and the class goes silent.  He realizes 
           he’s gone to far.

           With that she SLAMS a huge piece in his face.  Their eyes 
           connect.  It’s ON.

           They each scoop up a handful and nail the other, 
           screaming, laughing and ad libbing insults.  Thirty 
           seconds of delicious sexual tension marked by an old 
           fashioned food fight.  Laughing onlookers stay out of 
           their way.

           He chases her out into the hallway.  They’re covered.  
           She’s laughing so hard she can’t run any more and he 
           slides a cake covered hand down her head and back.  They 
           buckle with hysteria.  It’s intimate.  

                                 ALEXIA
                                 (pulling it together)
                        If I’d known this was going to 
                        happen I would’ve given you a gift 
                        certificate to the Olive Garden.

           It’s as if he’s seeing her for the first time, and he 
           really, really likes her.  He wipes some icing off her 
           face, suddenly shy.

                        Hey, so, I’m having a birthday 
                        party tomorrow night.  You think 
                        maybe you’d want to come?

                                 ALEXIA
                                 (shrugs, smiles)
                        Maybe.  Can’t promise anything.  I 
                        have tentative plans.

                                 BEN
                        Doing what?

                                 ALEXIA
                        Building houses for the homeless.  
                        In the dark.

           He grins at her as they share a gaze.

           SWOOSH!  A bathroom door opens and sexier than ever 
           Kaitlin emerges.  She sees them and frowns.

                                 KAITLIN
                                 (icy)

                                 (icier)
                        Ditto.

           She glances in Alexia’s direction, gives her the once 
           over and sneers.

                                 KAITLIN
                                 (to Ben)
                        Happy birthday.

           He watches as she walks away. Perhaps he still has 
           feelings for her.  Hard to tell.  She’s gorgeous and as 
           different from Alexia as you can be. Alexia studies her 
           figure intensely as it disappears down the hall.

           INT. RAVEN'S CAR - NIGHT

           Raven is on her cell, sitting outside Alexia's house.

           Raven freezes.  Standing next to the passenger door is 
           Alexia like we've never seen her before: fake tan, tons 
           of make up, acrylic nails and slutty outfit. Kaitlin.

           Alexia gets in the car, brimming with false bravado.  
           Raven has yet to close her mouth.

                                 ALEXIA

                        Just drive.

           The drive in silence for a moment.  Finally -

                                 ALEXIA (CONT’D)
                        So, I was on the site earlier and 
                        this girl asked, if a guy’s just 
                        broken up with a hottie, and she 
                        wants to take his mind off said 
                        hottie, what should she do?

                        Available, but not slutty.  And no 
                        strings.  That always hooks them.

                        I was just on the site. I don’t 
                        remember that question...?

           Alexia shrugs.  Raven looks pensive.

                                 RAVEN (CONT’D)

                        that’s crazy, right?

           But Alexia’s not even paying attention.  She checks her 
           lip gloss.  Raven sighs.
           INT. BEN’S HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           Raven and Alexia are at the party drinking.  Nervous, 
           Alexia's eyes search the party for Ben.

           INT. BEN’S HOUSE PARTY - LATER

           Alexia is totally buzzed when she spots Ben laughing with 
           some guys.  She’s working up the nerve to walk over but 
           then loses it.  She slinks back and pours another drink.

           Raven’s totally bored.  She spots Caleb across the room 
           hitting on some skank. He sees her and winks. She scowls.

                                 HORACE (O.S.)
                        Really, Raven, you have to stop 
                        stalking me.

           She turns around to find Horace behind her, grinning.  
           Either she's buzzed or he's really cute.  Maybe both.  
           She glances at Caleb hoping he's watching and then lays 
           it on thick.

                                 RAVEN
                        Horace!  How are you?  I haven't

                        you never return someone's calls 
                        or texts.

           She ignores him, and rubs her hands on his shoulders.

                                 RAVEN
                        Oooh.  Look how muscular you are.

           She puts her hand over his mouth and pulls him into the 
           laundry room, checking to see if Caleb is watching.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They're face to face in the dark room.

           And with that she kisses him.  He looks like he's seeing 
           stars and to be honest, she seems to be enjoying herself 
           too.  There’s a genuine connection.

           INT. BEN’S HOUSE PARTY - SAME TIME

           Alexia is just this side of tipsy by the time she has the 
           balls to make herself known.  Ben is equally drunk.

                                 BEN
                        Bass!  You made it!  And you look -

                        you look effing hot.

           Raven and Horace have found a pile of laundry to make out 
           on. She throws her shirt off.

           She looks at him like he's speaking Greek. Plus the room

           Raven rounds the corner just in time to see Alexia grab 
           Ben by the shirt and kiss him squarely.  Ben’s stunned.  

                                 ALEXIA
                        How much you wanted to show me 
                        your room?  

           Raven’s jaw goes slack as she watches Alexia lead Ben 
           upstairs.  She has to sit down to process.

           INT. BEN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Alexia stumbles as they enter his room.  She sees a book 
           (”Elegant Universe”) on his shelf and picks it up.

                                 ALEXIA
                        Oh.  You’re into quantum physics?

                                 BEN
                                 (really surprised)
                        Do you know this book?  

                                 ALEXIA
                        Sure.  I’m a String Theorist all 
                        the way.

           For a moment Ben looks almost lucid: this girl’s amazing.  

                                 BEN
                        You’re amazing, Bass.

           He puts the book down and kisses her.  They move to the 
           bed where he flips on the stereo.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        OK.  So a slightly drunken hook up 
                        with Ben wasn’t the stuff of Jane 
                        Austin but it was still a dream 
                        come true.

           It starts to get hot and heavy as they undress.  Alexia 
           is too far gone to realize she’s totally out of her 
           depth.

                                 BEN
                                 (smiling)
                        We’d better slow down.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        And because I was so determined 
                        not to let my big and potentially 
                        only chance with Ben Daniels pass 
                        me by, I said -

                        Don’t stop.

           He resumes kissing and fondling her.

                                 BEN
                                 (kissing)
                        You sure?

                                 (playing it cool)
                        Yeah, totally.  It’s no big deal.  
                        We’re just hooking up.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And then just to be sure the 
                        coffin was nailed, glued and 
                        cemented shut, I channeled my 
                        inner porn star.  I call her 
                        Stripped Bass.

                                 ALEXIA (CONT’D)
                        I want you so bad.

           Out of nowhere she FLIPS HIM onto his back and starts dry 
           humping him in her bra and panties.  Moaning.  Holy shit.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I was clearly in some debased 
                        galaxy far, far away, which is 
                        probably why I didn’t hear -

                                 BEN
                        Alexia.  Alexia.  

           He pushes her off.  She hits the floor with a thud.

                                 ALEXIA
                                 (discombobulated)
                        What?  What’s the matter?

                        I can’t do this.

           She’s frozen with embarrassment. 

                                 ALEXIA
                        Um.  Ok.  Why?

                                 BEN
                        It’s just that I’m sort of..

           She starts dressing manically.

                        be out of your hair as soon as I

                        Obviously I was into you.

                        Oh, totally.  I could tell by the 
                        way you threw me off your bed.

                                 BEN

                                 BEN
                        I’m serious.  I don’t have casual 
                        sex.  I’m a virgin. 

           She sits back down, “what??”.

                        I’m not like, saving myself for

                        it to be with someone who’s 
                        really, really special to me.  And 
                        I haven’t met her yet.

                                 BEN
                        Because she wouldn’t be someone 
                        who hooks up casually. No offense.

           Alexia rushes out of the house with Raven quick on her 
           heels.

                        Nothing.  I just drank too much 
                        and want to go home.

           INT. ALEXIA’S BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Alexia, still dressed like a slut but now donning an old 
           hoody, lies on the bathroom floor.  Suddenly she lurches 
           towards the toilet.  False alarm.  She sits back.

                        It was the night from hell.  After 
                        hacking up half the cast of the 
                        Muppet Show I still had to face 
                        the humiliation of what I’d done.

                        To Ben Daniels I was nothing more 
                        than a teenaged harlot, destined 
                        to a life of intravenous drug use 
                        and babies with multiple fathers.

           Off Alexia actually considering this.  

           A TEXT BUZZ pulls her out of her dream state.  She reads: 
           “TEXT FROM BEN DANIELS - Hey r u awake?  I’m outside ur 
           house and need 2 talk 2 u.”

                        flowers and an engagement ring but 
                        intuition told me otherwise.

           EXT. ALEXIA’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Alexia pulls her hoody around her in the morning cold as 
           she steps outside.  She sees Ben waiting at the end of 
           the driveway.  No flowers.  She approaches cautiously.

                        Listen, Alexia - I feel really bad 
                        about what happened... But it’s my 
                        fault.  I shouldn’t have taken you 
                        to my room. 

                                 ALEXIA
                        You didn’t.  I led you there.

                        just tell him the truth?  Why not 
                        just say, Ben it wasn’t me!  I was 
                        pretending to be someone I’m not -

                        She’s completely inauthentic.

                        had more in common with.

                        I understand.

           He kicks the dirt with his shoe, shaking his head.

                        I’d appreciate if you kept this 
                        between us.  It’s not like I’m

                        I’m just private.

           She nods.  It’s like the cord from the vacuum being 
           sucked back in.  She has to look away.  Not knowing what 
           else to do he gives her the most awkward hug imaginable.

                                 BASS
                        But we’re still friends, Alexia.  
                        Right?

           She just stands there, impassive, as he drives away. 

                                 ALEXIA
                                 (quietly)
                        What happened to Bass?

           She wipes away a mascara streaked tear.

           INT. ALEXIA'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Alexia is in bed and watching TV when she sees something 
           and bolts upright.  She grabs her phone.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Obviously I didn’t need anything 
                        else to knock me off my already 
                        catastrophic trajectory.  But such 
                        is life.

           One by one the girls appear in the SPLIT SCREEN. Each

                        that offers dating advice to 
                        teenage girls, and some think it’s 
                        pretty controversial-

           They cut to the clip of a five year old girl dressed as a 
           sexy librarian standing in front of an old fashioned 
           chalkboard, with the rules listed.  She points to a rule.

           Kelly has to turn around and put her head between her 
           knees.  Alexia changes the channel again to AC 360.

                        I guess the youtube clip blew up 
                        in like a day.  It already has

                        now everyone wants to know who 
                        started the page.

           EXT. ALEXIA'S PORCH - MORNING

           Hordes of screaming photographers and reporters are 
           clamoring to get an interview with Alexia.  She's FREAKED 
           OUT. She runs back into the house.

                        Turns out, it doesn’t take a

                        started a facebook page...
           INT. ALEXIA’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           SLOW MOTION: Alexia and her three friends sit like 
           zombies, as they’re given the third degree by their 
           parents.  The camera very slowly pushes into her face.

                        penchant for high school drama and 
                        a questionable moral compass.

                        I think the important thing to 
                        remember is that the girls didn’t 
                        really do anything wrong...

           She looks unsure and takes a drink of scotch.

                        wherever they're from, are like 
                        modern feminists.  What's so funny 
                        is that they probably don't even 
                        realize it. 

           The girls look at each other - they didn't realize it.

                        this is one of my favorite stories 
                        in a long while.  These are young

                        women. And they're not being 
                        hostile about it, nor are they 
                        trying to be manipulative.  These 
                        are real girls, who are giving 
                        advice that's truthfully relevant

           crossing the East River as the Manhattan skyline appears.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        A trip to New York City with your 
                        best girlfriends is the teenage 
                        equivalent of -

                        There is no equivalent.  
                                 (beat)
                        Now more than ever I needed my 
                        best friends around me, and 
                        something positive to be excited 
                        about.

           EXT. TIME SQUARE - DAY

           The girls have their picture taken with the NAKED COWBOY.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           The girls squeeze into the back of a horse-drawn 
           carriage.

           EXT. SAKS - DAY

           The girls stand outside and stare up at the structure 
           like it's a holy edifice.  They enter slowly and Raven 
           crosses herself.

           INT. SAKS/SHOE DEPARTMENT - LATER

           The girls stare at the shoes, wide eyed.  Alexia reaches 
           out to touch a Manolo and Sydney slaps her hand away.

                                 SYDNEY
                        No.  We are but mortals.

           INT. SAKS/DRESS DEPARTMENT - DAY

           The girls scour the dress department.  Raven holds up a 
           slinky, black, mini dress.

           Kelly holds up an overly ruffled frock.

                                 KELLY
                        How about this one?

                                 SYDNEY
                        Well I know I wouldn't do you.

           Kelly frowns and puts it back.  Alexia holds up something 
           tailored and matronly.

                                 ALEXIA
                        This could work.

                        Not skanky enough?  

           Raven turns and faces her squarely.

                        Hi, Amy Winehouse? I seem to 
                        remember a little episode at a 
                        party last week.  So let's not 
                        throw stones, shall we?

           The four of them begin to bicker.  

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        And that's when I realized - even 
                        though Hot Mess was supposed to be 
                        about female empowerment, it was 
                        still all about guys. Bottom line: 
                        we didn't want to go to the prom 
                        as a foursome - we wanted to go 
                        with real dates, specifically with 
                        the guys we were all so hung up 
                        on.

           INT. THE VIEW GREEN ROOM - MORNING

           The girls have their hair and make up touched up in the 
           green room.  They look seriously nervous. 

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        And worst of all, we felt like a 
                        bunch of hypocrites for going on 
                        national TV to espouse rules we 
                        could barely follow ourselves.  
                        Not to mention we had all been 
                        lying to each other for weeks.  
                        Unfortunately I made the mistake 
                        of thinking we had already hit 
                        bottom.

           Kelly is nearly shaking and pops out of her seat.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Oh my God, I have to pee again.

                        Will you stop peeing?  You're 
                        making me nervous!

           Just as Kelly runs into the adjoining bathroom, her cell 
           buzzes.  Sydney picks it up.

                                 SYDNEY
                        Kel, you're blowing up...

           She happens to look down at ID screen. Her face turns 
           beet red.  POV of cell phone:  "TEXT FROM DREW:  Just 
           wanted to say I'm thinking of you today.  You're going to 
           do great.  Can't wait to see you when you get back!"

           Sydney nearly loses her balance but straightens herself.  
           When nobody is looking, she tosses the phone into a soda 
           cooler. A production assistant pokes her head in.

                                 PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
                        Three minutes!

           Raven and Alexia look a bit green but Sydney is stone 
           faced.  Kelly exits the bathroom.

                                 KELLY
                        Has anyone seen my cell?

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. THE VIEW SET - MOMENTS LATER

           The girls are squeezed onto the couch with the View 
           ladies,  trying not to look like they could shit their 
           pants at any moment.  Alexia looks especially paralyzed 
           by the cameras and lights.

                        So today we're talking to the four 
                        young ladies behind the Facebook 
                        group called Hot Mess: Don’t Be 
                        One, where they offer fifteen 
                        rules of dating for teenage girls. 
                        It has over one point five million 
                        members worldwide, and was the 
                        number one google hit last week.
                                 (to the girls)
                        Did you ever think it would get 
                        this big?

           The girls shake their heads and giggle.

                        Definitely not. It kinda started 
                        as a joke.

                                 ELISABETH
                        So what was the impetus to create 
                        the group?

           The girls look at each other sheepishly.

                        Such mystery!  Wow, you girls have 
                        it all figured out already. I want 
                        to talk about some of the actual 
                        rules - can we get them up?

           The rules appear on the huge screen behind them.

                                 JOY BEHAR (CONT’D)
                        I mean some of these totally crack 
                        me up.  Like number four, don't 
                        harass the exes family.  I got an 
                        ex brother in law who should join 
                        your group.

           The audience laughs.

                        How about, no cyber sex with ex?  
                        What happened to just going out 
                        for a milk shake?

           The audience laughs again.

                                 BARBARA WALTERS
                        Now some of your rules are pretty 
                        explicit.  Such as rule number 
                        eleven, 'your friend's ex? You -'

           Barbara coyly avoids saying "bitch" and the audience 
           laughs some more.

                        language.  But isn't something 
                        like that just sort of obvious?

           Her tone is so nasty that even the View Ladies tense a up 
           visibly. Kelly couldn't be more confused. Or embarrassed.

           Ben and the rest of the staff are watching The View 
           unfold.  Everybody turns to look at him.

           He’s NOT happy.  Finally he shrugs, “so be it”, and walks 
           out.  The staff begins to gossip uncontrollably.

           INT. THE VIEW - SAME TIME

                        trying to steal you away or 
                        something?

                        right.  I like you.  A lot.  And 
                        for the record, I’m not your

           With that, he leans in to kiss her.  Their lips touch 
           only for a moment before she gets her bearings and pulls 
           away, stunned and horrified.

                                 KELLY
                        No, Drew.  Never.  It can never 
                        happen.  Do you understand me?  
                        Never.

           They hold a gaze: he’s hurt but she’s resolute.  She 
           turns and walks away.

                        back, including my pitiful attempt 
                        at a seduction, I would.  But I 
                        can’t.  So, what now?  Yes, the 
                        world knows you’re a virgin, guess 
                        what?  Me too. But on top of it, 
                        the world also knows that I liked 
                        you so much I was willing to be 
                        someone else just to get you to 
                        like me.  I couldn’t even be a 
                        fool in private.

                                 BEN
                        You should have just been 
                        yourself.

                                 ALEXIA
                        Thanks for the tip, man, but if 
                        you notice it didn’t get me very 
                        far.  So I was ‘inauthentic’. I 
                        know, I know, you hate girls who 
                        are inauthentic. And gossips. Two 
                        down for Bass.  I mean, Alexia.  
                        Guess we can’t be friends, right? 

           He shoots her a look.

                                 ALEXIA (CONT’D)
                        Obviously you’ve never screwed up 
                        before because you have an amazing 
                        lack of compassion for those of us 
                        who have.  

           With that she turns and leaves him there. Off his face.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t the fairy tale ending I 
                        had hoped for, but at least I felt 
                        like me again. 

           INT. SYDNEY’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Sydney is lying in bed, looking at old photos.  As she 
           flips past photos of old boyfriends her face changes.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        While trying to sift through her 
                        own debris, Sydney took a trip 
                        down memory lane and a funny thing 
                        happened.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           CLOSE ON: a photo of Sydney and a boy wearing leather 
           jackets and skinny jeans.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        There was the The Headbanger, who 
                        she dated for three months until 
                        her nose ring got infected.

           Sydney flips the page.  CLOSE ON: Sydney and a guy in 
           corduroys and Birkenstocks.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The Hippie, who she would sit 
                        around with and philosophize about 
                        things like ice cream headaches.

           Sydney flips the page.  CLOSE ON:  Sydney and Drew.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And then there was The Adventurer.

           Off Sydney’s pensive face.  

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Suddenly it occurred to her - 
                        what’s the point of not being 
                        herself in a relationship that’s 
                        dysfunctional anyway?  She may as 
                        well be herself and let the chips 
                        fall where they may.  It’s a lot 
                        less energy and effort and she can 
                        finally wear what she wants.

           Sydney smiles.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        As the saying goes, ‘you can’t 
                        please everyone all of the time so 
                        you may as well please yourself.’

           INT. RAVEN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Raven sits in her pajamas, staring into space.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        As for Raven, It finally occurred 
                        to her that the reason she dated 
                        so much was because it prevented 
                        her from facing the one thing she 
                        was most afraid of: being alone.  
                        She didn’t just need a detox from 
                        boys, she needed a break from the 
                        constant validation that she was 
                        always looking for.

                        And she knew that the time had 
                        come to deal with it.

           She gets up and unplugs the TV, stereo, her cell and the 
           computer. With great trepidation, she turns off her IPod.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That weekend Raven forwent all 
                        forms of stimulation and forced 
                        herself to just be for a couple of 
                        days.

           Raven takes a deep breath, opens a journal, and starts 
           writing.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It was the scariest thing she had 
                        ever done, but when the weekend 
                        was over, she felt more empowered 
                        than she ever thought possible.

           INT. ALEXIA’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Alexia’s demeanor hasn’t changed much. She’s lying in bed 
           reading The Bell Jar.

                                 ALEXIA’S MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Alexia!  Someone’s at the door for

                        Just leave the death threats on 
                        the coffee table, thanks.

                                 ALEXIA’S MOTHER
                        Alexia, please come down!

           INT. ALEXIA’S LIVING ROOM/FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Alexia sullenly makes her way to the door where her 
           mother is trying (badly) to hide a smile.  There’s a UPS 
           delivery man waiting with a manila envelope.

                                 DELIVERY MAN

           The guy leaves and Alexia opens the envelope.

                        It’s from the View!  Oh God, are 
                        they suing me or something?  
                        Aren’t there laws if you’re 
                        underage?

           Alexia’s mother rolls her eyes and takes the letter.

                        broken a few hearts by removing 
                        Hot Mess from the internet.  We’ve

                        help convince you to put the site

                        feel a little embarrassed about 
                        what happened on the air, but 
                        welcome to our world!  It would be 
                        such a shame to let a little pride 
                        get in the way of all the good 
                        you’ve done, let alone stop the

                        age - you could have spared us

                        betrayed by us.  If anything our

           INT. ALEXIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The girls have assembled.  The tension is palpable.

                                 ALEXIA
                                 (nervous)
                        Thank you guys for coming over.  I 
                        needed to show you something.

           She drags a few huge boxes out of her closet and pulls 
           out a stack of printed emails.

                                 ALEXIA (CONT’D)
                        Evidently while we were in hiding, 
                        some of our fans wrote a few 
                        emails to the View.  

           She passes out the letters.  They can hardly believe it 
           as they flip through.

                                 RAVEN
                        Is this for real?

                                 KELLY
                        I don’t even know what language

                        And when I signed on to facebook 
                        for the first time since, well... 
                        There’s a whole facebook group 
                        devoted to bringing Hot Mess back, 
                        and it has just as many members as 
                        the original group.

                                 SYDNEY
                        I don’t understand.  So they don’t

                        But more importantly, do we hate

                        I mean this whole thing started as

                        thing I know we’re on TV ripping 
                        each other new assholes.
                                 (trails off)
                        And if you guys think it’s all my 
                        fault then I’ll take 
                        responsibility.  I’m sorry, I 
                        truly am.  I never meant for any 
                        of this to happen.

           The girls stand to hug her, ad libbing protests.

                                 SYDNEY
                        I’m the one who’s sorry!  I can’t 
                        believe I went postal on national 
                        TV. Raven, I completely threw you 
                        under the bus! And Kelly, oh my

                        I know you weren’t making a play 
                        for Drew.  I know you would never 
                        do that.

           They hug, but Kelly looks conflicted.

                        I think I’m kind of over the

                        think I’m going to take a little 
                        time for me, maybe.  Because in a 
                        totally ass-backwards way, the 
                        rules really worked for me.

                        Yeah, you know, it’s kind of like 
                        I think maybe on some level I’ve 
                        been afraid of being rejected by 
                        someone realistic, because, like

                        was always safer to be rejected by 
                        guys I knew I couldn’t have.

           REPRISE “LITTLE GREEN BAG” BY THE GEORGE BAKER SELECTION.

           MONTAGE:  The girls get ready for prom.  Quick shots of 
           make up being applied, corsages being pinned, etc.

                        Through all the twists and turns, 
                        at the end of the day the idea of 
                        going to the prom together 
                        couldn’t have been more perfect. 

           INT. PROM - NIGHT

           Watch in SLOW MOTION as our girls - totally decked out - 
           walk into prom a’la Reservoir Dogs.  They’re back.

           The prom is being held in a beautiful two-level, hotel 
           ballroom. On a stage at the far end is a live band.

                        It was weird. From the outside 
                        everything looked the same, but 
                        really, everything was different.  
                        We were more like the girls we 
                        used to be and at the same time, 
                        more like the women we were to 
                        become.

           the bandstand where Horace’s band is playing.  When she

                        she’s best friends with a person 
                        he never should have gone out with  
                        in the first place.

           Kelly is completely thrown.

                                 SYDNEY (CONT’D)
                        Just say yes.

                                 KELLY
                        But what about rule eleven?

                                 SYDNEY
                                 (laughing)
                        We amend it. ‘Stay away from your 
                        best friend’s ex unless she tells 
                        you that you belong together.’
                                 (beat)
                        And you do.

           It takes Kelly an extra moment but she finally gives in.  
           They embrace.

           ANGLE ON: Alexia - somehow more mature - has been 
           chatting with some other kids.  She sees Ben across the 
           room.  They look at each other, neither sure what to do.  
           Finally he turns away.  Raven clocks it.

                                 RAVEN
                        Hey.  Like, I don’t know what goes 
                        on between virgins, but if you 
                        really believe that you were meant 
                        for each other then you should 
                        fight for it.  Hell, you can’t 
                        possibly embarrass yourself more 
                        than I already have.

           They share a smile.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Raven was right.  It was now or 
                        never.  And it had to be big.

           Alexia turns on a dime, marches up to Horace and starts 
           pleading with him about something.  He shakes his head 
           but she appears to be begging - begging.

           Finally he agrees to whatever and has a tiny pow wow with 
           his band mates.  Alexia looks up at the ceiling as if 
           asking for grace and then makes her way onto the stage.  
           She takes the microphone as her presence has begun to 
           quiet the room.

                                 ALEXIA (CONT’D)
                                 (clearing throat)
                        Uh hi, hi everyone.

           Sydney, Raven and Kelly find each other, concerned.  

                                 SYDNEY
                        What the hell is she doing?

                                 ALEXIA
                                 (shaking)
                        So I’m up here right now for one 
                        reason and one reason only, and 
                        that’s to see if I can get Ben 
                        Daniels to get to know the real 
                        me.  Because never in the history 
                        of humankind has a mistake been 
                        made as colossal as this. So Ben, 
                        I’m going to prove to you that 
                        anything can be overcome, whether 
                        it be rebuilding a friendship, or 
                        confronting a lifelong phobia that 
                        could potentially put a person in 
                        a sanitarium. If they even still 
                        have those anymore.  Whatever it 
                        takes to be Bass in your eyes 
                        again.
                                 (smiles)
                        Don’t relegate me to Jason status.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (6)

           Somewhere in the audience Jason frowns.

           The band starts playing “I Would Be (500 Miles)”.  Alexia 
           looks like she could shit her pants.  Kelly puts her 
           hands over her mouth.  Sydney grins.

                                 KELLY
                        Oh my God.  She’s going to sing!

           And she does. BADLY.  REALLY BADLY.  It’s barely a 
           whisper.  The crowd claps, encouraging her to be louder. 

           From the back of the room, Ben comes forward.  She has 
           melted him and the smile on his face says it all.

           Alexia belts it out like a cat being waterboarded.  She 
           closes her eyes just a moment and when she opens them, 
           she hears Ben’s voice singing the harmony.

           He’s standing right next to her (with his own mic).  

           The crowd goes nuts as they serenade each other

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        Some magical moments are fate.  
                        Some are earned.  And some 
                        wouldn’t even be worth it unless 
                        you had been to hell and back, 
                        first. ‘Tevs. It all comes out in 
                        the wash.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. PROM - LATER

           Raven and Sydney pull Kelly and Drew into the “picture 
           line”.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.)
                        In the end, I realized that 
                        sometimes we lose the inner 
                        compass that tells us who we are 
                        and what we’re worth. And when 
                        that happens, it’s okay to take a 
                        beat and regroup.

           Raven, Sydney and Kelly search the crowd, “where’s 
           Alexia?”

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Because honestly, there's no real 
                        ‘how to’ when it comes to love.   
                        I mean there's logic, like don't 
                        give away the farm.  
                                 (MORE)

                        But most of the time you just have 
                        to wing it and remember that even 
                        people who get A's in school don't 
                        always get A's in life.  

           Raven spots them and points excitedly.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        We all make mistakes, but it's 
                        what we do afterwards that 
                        separates the men from the 
                        douchebags. 

           ANGLE ON:  Ben and Alexia making out in the corner.  
           Raven runs over and pulls them into the picture line.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Because at the end of the day, 
                        life is messy, and anyone who 
                        tells you otherwise is a bigger 
                        hot mess than you are.   

           Instead of doing “couples shots” they opt for one large 
           group photo. It’s effing adorable.

                                 ALEXIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps these are the new halcyon 
                        days when not having the answers 
                        is okay.  As long as you've got 
                        friends beside you making their 
                        own hot messes and still loving 
                        you for yours, then really, what 
                        else is there? 

           FLASH!  The still photo of their happy, smiling Hot Mess 
           faces.

                                                                  THE END
