           ON A BLACK SCREEN

                                 VOICE OVER
                            (whispering)
                        You want to know what the secret to
                        life is...?

           A long beat, then...

           The blackness slowly blurs as it mixes with light and an
           image struggles into focus.

           POV - EYES OPENING ON:

           ENGLISH PETE, an older gentleman with avuncular eyes and a
           crocodile smile.  As we SLOWLY PULL OUT, we see two thick-
           fingered Cro-Magnon throwbacks in expensive suits, a size
           too small for their musclebound bodies, standing shoulder-to-
           shoulder behind English Pete.

           Oddly enough, English Pete has an English accent.  Not the
           Queen's English but a thick cockney brogue.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        This is Brick and Tiny.  They don't
                        like you.  Not one bit.  In fact,
                        they want to put a world of hurt on
                        you...  Somethin' fierce.  But it's
                        your lucky day.  'Cause I'm your
                        guardian angel.  And I'm here to
                        save your life.

           INT. WAREHOUSE

           Small, poorly lit.  And in the middle of it MICHAELANGELO
           "MICKEY" KALLIGHERI is tied to a chair.  A handsome young
           man, his looks are barely diminished by his predicament.  He
           is unkempt but untouched.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        C'mon, Mickey.  "Help me, help you."

           Brick and Tiny grin.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        Look, son, we can do this the hard
                        way... or the really hard way.

           They wait on Mickey.

                                 MICKEY
                            (despondent)
                        Please. I don't--
                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Hey Mickey, I can live with you not
                        telling me.  Problem is, you can't.

                                 MICKEY
                            (sotto)
                        I swear.  I don't know.
                            (beat)
                        It's the truth.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Yeah, well, the truth is overrated. 
                        You should be more concerned with
                        telling me exactly what I want to
                        hear.

           Mickey's head drops in defeat.

                        Alright then...
                            (to Brick and Tiny)
                        "Everybody neat and pretty?  Then on
                        with the show!"

           Brick and Tiny step forward and fill the screen with their
           enormity.  Christ, they're huge!

           As it curls into a tight-fisted sledgehammer.

           CLOSE ON BRICK'S FIST

           As it pulls back and then launches forward:

           WHACK!

                            (pleased as punch)
                        It's funny, how your luck can change
                        just like that.  Okay, I know what
                        you're thinking... But here's the
                        thing... Who wants to have an ordinary
                        life?

                        Yeah, that's what I thought. 

           END FREEZE
           The boys continue to dismantle Mickey.

           FREEZE ON  -- Another preternaturally cruel shot.  Blood
           sprays from Mickey's mouth directly into camera.

                        It's too late for me... but I can
                        teach you some things.  See, that's
                        the irony of life.  The really
                        important stuff, the stuff that really
                        matters, you never figure it out
                        until you're about to die.  You want
                        to know something for sure?  Ask a
                        dead guy.  Cause there's something
                        about dying that makes you real smart. 
                        Somehow death turns everybody into a
                        philosopher. 

           END FREEZE.  Again the boys mangle Mickey in the B.G.

                        All of a sudden you know what's really
                        important and what really matters --
                        and believe me, it ain't that they

                        And while we're at it, fuck your
                        obsession with the length of your
                        penis or the size of your breasts. 
                        That's not what matters.  What really
                        matters in life --

           IN SCENE

           Brick rips a textbook cross into Mickey's jaw producing a
           CRACK that rattles the liver and rocks the soul.

                        Sorry, where was I?  Oh yeah. 
                        Everybody should live like they're
                        about to die.  Problem is, you don't
                        know how, until you're dying --  But
                        you gotta always strive for something
                        more, something better.  You know,

           A well worn room with antiquated furnishings that look like
           they were inherited from somebody's grandmother.

           Slumped on a ratty couch with a bowl of cereal resting on
           his chest, Mickey is a monument to disregard.  His hair is
           unkempt and his five o'clock shadow is fast approaching six. 
           The word "sloth" comes to mind.

           A virtual somnambulist, he watches De Palma's Scarface on an
           old TV and silently mouths the words while simultaneously
           reading a self-help book. By the way, he looks about as

                        you got a lucky break: rich uncle,
                        famous cousin, fucking father-in-law
                        hooked him up.

           Takes a drag off a cigarette.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The only difference between me and
                        those guys... is that I probably
                        deserved it.  Where the fuck was my
                        hook-up?
                            (beat)
                        But I guess it's my own fault...
                        because, well...  I'm a loser.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Not a bottom of the barrel loser,
                        just a smack dab in the middle loser. 
                        I didn't have a rich daddy, wasn't
                        born in a nice neighborhood or captain
                        of the football team.  Didn't date
                        cheerleaders.  Didn't inspire respect,
                        or awe, or admiration.  I was bone-
                        chillingly average.  And average
                        isn't part of the American Dream. 
                        Average makes you a loser.  And
                        America hates losers.  With a passion. 
                        Yeah, I was average... and that was
                        completely unacceptable.  So I turned
                        to crime. Don't get me wrong, I've
                        had real jobs. It's just, you know,
                        I ain't proud of it.

                                 MICKEY IN SCENE
                            (sotto; mimicking TV)
                        "Fihrs chu get de mohney, meng.  Den
                        chu get de pohwer, den chu get de
                        womahn..."

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Yeah, I'm a ticking time bomb.  You
                        would be too if you hadn't already
                        given up.

           He slams a swig of coke and chases it with a long drag off
           his cigarette then shovels a few more spoonfuls of cereal
           into his mouth.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        What the fuck are you doing here!

           An old oversized woman smoking a cigarette walks by in
           undersized underwear and smacks Mickey across the back of
           the head as she passes into the kitchen.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        That's my Mom --

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        Get a job!
                            (sotto)
                        Loser.

           Mickey's reaction tells us that he's heard this no less than
           800 or 900 times.

                                 ANOTHER WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        What the fuck are you doing here!

           TRACY enters.  She is a train wreck of tight and baggy clothes
           with ten years of bad attitude and big hair knotted onto her
           face.  She smacks Mickey across the back of the head as she
           passes.
                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        That's my sister, Tracy.

                                 TRACY
                        Is that my fuckin' coke?
                            (sotto)
                        Loser.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Welcome to my world.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. CAR -- MOVING

           Mickey rides shotgun next to BRENTWOOD "GOO GOO" GUGLIOSI. 

           Although only in his mid-twenties, Goo Goo is worn well beyond
           his years.  In spite of this, his intense gaze and
           concentration suggest a certain intelligence and vitality.

           Goo Goo lights up.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        That's my boy, Goo Goo.  Yeah, I
                        know, the name's kinda fucked up,
                        but his first name is Brentwood and
                        his last name is Gugliosi.  Goo Goo
                        doesn't seem so bad all of a sudden,
                        huh?  He's my oldest friend and
                        partner in crime... literally.
                            (beat)
                        We make a good team 'cause we got a
                        lot in common.  Like neither one of
                        us wants to go to jail.  Don't get
                        me wrong, I got plenty of friends in
                        jail, it just ain't for me.  For
                        one, I don't like anal.  Giving or
                        receiving.  And you know, if you
                        don't like sunshine, then stay the
                        fuck out of Florida, right?

           Some cigarette smoke wafts into Mickey's face.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (indicating cigarette)
                        What are you doing?

                                 GOO GOO
                        What?

                                 MICKEY
                        You know I had asthma as a kid.

                                 GOO GOO
                        Mickey... you smoke.
                                 MICKEY
                        That doesn't mean I want someone
                        else smoking around me.  Second-hand
                        smoke is the most dangerous kind.

                                 GOO GOO
                        So you're saying it's worse to be
                        around a smoker than to be a smoker?

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah.

                                 GOO GOO
                        Well, that doesn't even make any
                        sense.

                                 MICKEY
                        It doesn't have to make sense, it's
                        a fact.

           Something catches Goo Goo's eye out the window.

                                 GOO GOO
                        That Jo?

                                 MICKEY
                        Fuck you.

                                 GOO GOO
                        No, serious.

           Mickey looks out the window.

                                 MICKEY
                            (to himself)
                        Fuck.
                            (to Goo Goo)
                        Turn around.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET

           A young man waits in an idling car.  Mickey pulls JOSEPHINE
           "JO" AMBERSINO away from the car.  Jo is a whip: Pretty,
           smart, sexy and tough -- The ripest fruit on the highest
           branch.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        That's my girlfriend Josephine. 
                        Love of my life.  We have the kind
                        of love that only comes along once
                        in a lifetime, like Romeo and Juliet,
                        Pamela and Tommy Lee, or Napoleon
                        and...  What's her name?
                                 JO
                        Michaelangelo-Giovanni-Kalligheri,
                        take your fucking hands off of me!

                                 MICKEY
                        What are you doing?

                                 JO
                        Do not start your shit.

                                 MICKEY
                        Jo?

                                 JO
                        I have a job interview.

                                 MICKEY
                        In a fucking car?

                                 JO
                        We're going to lunch.

                                 MICKEY
                            (indicating Goo Goo's
                             car)
                        Get in the car.

           Jo stares him down.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Get in the fucking car.

                                 JO
                        Tell me it's not stolen.

                                 MICKEY
                        Come on, Jo!  You know it's not stolen --

           FREEZE FRAME

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Okay, technically, she's right...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           FLASHBACK

           EXT. SIDEWALK -- DAY

           Mickey and Goo Goo approach a long line of cars waiting for
           VALET SERVICE at a trendy lunch spot and unzip hoodies to
           reveal matching white shirts and black bow ties.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        The car may be a little stolen.

           They step into the street and approach the last car in line
           as its owner gets out.
           Mickey and Goo Goo hop in and tear off.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Jo starts to walk away.  Mickey stops her.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Jo, don't do this.

                                 JO
                        I swear to God Mickey, you fuck this
                        up for me, and I'll have my brother
                        gut shoot you.

                                 MICKEY
                        I love you.

                                 JO
                        You piece of shit.

           Mickey drops to one knee and tries to take Jo's hand in the
           universal "proposal posture." Jo is having none of it.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        No!  No!  Don't you fucking dare. 
                        Get out of here, Mickey.

                                 MICKEY
                        Will you just listen to me?

                                 JO
                        Mickey, we've been broken up for
                        over two years.

                                 MICKEY
                            (exasperated)
                        Oh, Goddamnit!  Don't start with
                        that again.

                                 JO
                        What'd I say to you?

                                 MICKEY
                        Jo, listen to me --

                                 JO
                        I don't want to see you until you
                        get a job and get your shit together.

                                 MICKEY
                        I got jobs.

                                 JO
                        Real jobs, Mickey.  That you can't
                        go to jail for!  I'm tired of all
                        your nowhere bullshit.
                                 MICKEY
                        Tell me you don't love me.

                                 JO
                        You wanna know the type of man I'm
                        in love with?  First, he has a job,
                        so my mother doesn't cry every time
                        I bring him home.  He thinks he's
                        going to live past thirty and acts
                        like it.  He knows I don't want to
                        have to worry about bringing our
                        children to visit him in prison. He
                        doesn't have a hard time choosing
                        between me and his fucking deadbeat
                        friends, he doesn't play video games
                        all day while I'm at work, and he
                        doesn't get high all the time because
                        he knows I like a good bang with a
                        nice hard one every now and then.

           There is a long uncomfortable silence between them, then:

                                 MICKEY
                        Okay, that happened once.

           Jo throws her hands in the air and storms off.  Mickey calls
           after her:

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Jo... love you, Sweetie!

                                 MICKEY V.O.
                        We're going through a little bit of
                        a rough patch right now.  But it
                        ain't her fault, it's just, you
                        know... Estrogen.
                            (sighs; dreamily)
                        I'm gonna marry that girl.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON - MICKEY'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS

           As he crawls toward camera in the tight and confined space
           of an air duct.

           INT. AIR DUCT

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        There is no Easter Bunny.  Or Santa
                        Claus.  No free lunch or free rides. 
                        All of those things that meant so
                        much to you early in your life...
                        lies.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. SCHWANITZ'S DRUGSTORE -- NIGHT

           The last of the Mom and Pops.

           ANGLE ON -- THE CEILING

           as a TILE is pulled back to reveal Mickey.  A moment later
           Mickey's body descends from the ceiling and drops to the
           floor.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        You know what does exist?  Cancer,
                        debt, taxes, bad relationships, stupid
                        bosses, lousy drivers, shitty sales
                        people, missed periods, late fees,
                        long lines, and crime.  Like it or
                        not, these are things you can count
                        on.  That's why I became a criminal. 
                        Because crime is one of the few things
                        in this life that you can count on. 
                        If you really want it, it's always
                        there for you.

           Mickey strolls the aisles with a trained eye and a casual
           demeanor. After a moment he finds HEAVY DUTY TRASH BAGS,
           opens the box, and begins to fill them with bounty from candy
           and razors to batteries and blood pressure cuffs.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It doesn't take long to realize that
                        following the rules doesn't get you
                        anywhere.  But breaking the rules...
                        you can have anything you want...
                        even if you're not supposed to want
                        it.
                            (beat)
                        Whoever said crime doesn't pay, must
                        have been a lousy fucking criminal.

           Something suddenly catches Mickey's eye.

           MICKEY'S POV -- OF THE GATED PHARMACY

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DRUGSTORE BACK ROOM

           A SECURITY GUARD sleeps soundly with his head on a desk.  A
           WRENCHING SOUND is heard O.S. and the guard's eyes flutter
           open.

           The Guard sits up at attention, his eyes wild with wonder
           and fear.

           Again, the WRENCHING SOUND O.S

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. DRUGSTORE

           Mickey shovels a plethora of prescription pills into his
           bags.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        I need a pill to go to sleep every
                        night and I need one to get up every
                        morning.  When I get home, I need
                        one to bring it down.  I even need
                        one to get it on.  Up, down, in,
                        out, on.  Rinse.  Repeat.  Two or
                        three times a day, 365 days a
                        year.Fuck E=MC2, that's the perfect
                        equation.

           Mickey pops a mishmash of pills into his mouth.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I'm not a junky or anything, just...
                        An American.  Everybody's slightly
                        addicted to something: drugs, sex,
                        debt, bad relationships, daddy
                        figures.  Whatever.  Me, I just, you
                        know, dabble in prescription
                        pharmaceuticals from time to time to
                        help ease the existential angst of
                        daily life.  Don't get me wrong, I
                        didn't do drugs because I didn't
                        have any choices, it's just that of
                        all the choices I had, drugs were
                        the best one.

           Mickey's thought is interrupted by THE SECURITY GUARD swinging
           around the corner with A BIG ASS GUN:

                                 GUARD
                        Die motherfucker, die!

           BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!

           Mickey reflexively dives for cover as a cloud of pills
           explodes around him.

           The guard rushes toward Mickey firing wildly.  BOOM!  BOOM! 
           BOOM!

           Mickey scrambles across the floor...

           And down the aisles with merchandise exploding around him.

           The security guard gives chase.

           Mickey desperately looks for an exit... But everything is
           gated and locked.  No way out but up.

           Panic needle running high, Mickey scuttles down an aisle...
           And makes a run for it.

           The guard spots him...

           And fires away...

           Mickey jumps onto a display case, Pop Tarts exploding in
           every direction as he jumps for the hole in the ceiling.

           He catches it... but slips and swings by one hand as the
           guard charges.

           Mickey's bags tear and spill bounty as he struggles back up
           into the ceiling duct.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DUCT

           Shots ring out and tear through the ceiling inches from Mickey
           as he crawls through the ductwork.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DINER

           Mickey and Goo Goo sit with burgers in front of them. 
           Mickey's burger is untouched.  Goo Goo munches happily
           throughout.  They might as well be on different planets:

                                 GOO GOO
                        You're a lousy fuckin' criminal, you
                        know that?

                                 MICKEY
                        What?

                                 GOO GOO
                        I can't believe you didn't get
                        anything.

                                 MICKEY
                        I almost got dead.

                                 GOO GOO
                        But you didn't.

                                 MICKEY
                        But this fuckin' close.  And for
                        what?

           Goo Goo shrugs.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        This ain't working, man.

                                 GOO GOO
                        What isn't?
                                 MICKEY
                        My whole fuckin' life.

                                 GOO GOO
                        You know what you need to do?  Go
                        rob another drugstore.  Right now.

           Mickey gives Goo Goo a look.

                                 GOO GOO (CONT'D)
                        It's like when they say if you fall
                        out of a plane and your parachute
                        doesn't open, you gotta go right
                        back up and jump again right away or
                        else you'll be spooked for the rest
                        of your life.  You're just spooked,
                        man.

           Mickey is distracted by the analogy.

                                 MICKEY
                        You jump out of a plane and your
                        parachute don't open, you'd be dead.

                                 GOO GOO
                        You know what I mean.

           Mickey considers then nods no.

                                 MICKEY
                        Never again, man.  Never.

                                 GOO GOO
                        What the fuck are you talking about?

                                 MICKEY
                        I'm talking about a crossroads, Goo.

           Goo Goo looks out the window confused.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        I'm at a crossroads.  I just got a
                        second chance staring down the barrel
                        of that gun --

                                 GOO GOO
                        You wasn't really staring down the
                        barrel, cause you were running away,
                        right?

           Mickey stares at Goo Goo annoyed.

                                 MICKEY
                        Anyway, it made me realize, this
                        ain't worth dying for.
                                 GOO GOO
                        Well nothing's worth dying for. 
                        That's why it's death, right?  Sucks
                        to be dead no matter what.

           Mickey struggles to ignore it.

                                 MICKEY
                        Don't you get it?  It's not that
                        we're lousy criminals, crime has
                        changed.  There's no more room for
                        the little guys and independents. 
                        The days of Bonnie and Clyde are
                        over --

           Oblivious to Mickey's point, Goo Goo smiles and nods:

                                 GOO GOO
                        Bonnie and Clyde.

                                 MICKEY
                        To be a criminal now-a-days you gotta
                        wear a suit and tie and have a masters
                        degree.

           Goo Goo is suddenly offended.

                                 GOO GOO
                        No, man, there's a difference.  The
                        shit they do is evil.  We're not
                        scumbags, Mick, just criminals. 
                        Entrepreneurs of the illegal.  There's
                        a difference.  A big fucking
                        difference.

                                 MICKEY
                        Don't you get it?  We have an
                        opportunity to change our lives,
                        man.  You know, just start over. 
                        Leave all this shit behind --

           Goo Goo seems deeply affected... or just really hungry.  He
           takes a massive bite of burger.

           ECU OF GOO GOO'S MOUTH AND GREASY LIPS

           As he masticates grease, meat, and cheese in SLOW MOTION.

                        And just like that I wanted to pay a
                        mortgage.  I wanted a good job with
                        benefits and I wanted to practically
                        kill myself trying to keep it.  I
                        wanted to make more money than my
                        neighbor.  I wanted to lease an
                        expensive car, buy everything I saw
                        on infommercials.

                        I wanted a high yield interest bearing
                        money market account, a big wedding,
                        the perfect wife, and disease-free,
                        taller-than-average, perfect body
                        mass index, scholarship winning
                        children.  And Jo.  I wanted Jo. 
                        More than anything else in this world. 
                        And I realized there was only one
                        way in this world to do that.  Sell
                        the fuck out.  The system sucks, but
                        it's the system for a reason.

                        I need a job.

                                 GOO GOO
                        I heard about something down on --

                                 MICKEY
                        No, a real job.  I'm tired of all
                        this nowhere bullshit

           Goo Goo looks at Mickey like a foreign object.

                                 GOO GOO
                        Jo?

                                 MICKEY
                        No, not Jo.  I'm just -- Look, living
                        the hustle's okay for a guy like you
                        cause you act like you ain't gonna
                        live past thirty, but you can't just
                        go through life hanging out with
                        deadbeat friends, playing video games
                        and getting high all of the time.

           Goo Goo stares at Mickey a good long time.

                                 GOO GOO
                        Why not?

                                 MICKEY
                        I can't keep doing this dead-end
                        shit.  I need something else.  You
                        don't understand cause you're younger
                        than me, but some day, fuckin' some
                        day you will.

                                 GOO GOO
                        Mickey -- I'm seven months younger
                        than you.

                                 MICKEY
                        That's my point!  I can't explain
                        it.  You'll see.  In seventh months
                        it's gonna hit you...  like a
                        motherfucker.
                                 GOO GOO
                        This mean we're not stealing shit
                        tonight?

           Mickey shoots Goo Goo a look.  He struggles long and hard to
           find the right words, but can't.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Looking like a little boy in Sunday school wearing a collared
           shirt with neatly combed hair.

           INT. OFFICE WAITING ROOM

           Mickey sits in the middle of a long row of chairs full of
           anxious job applicants with clipboards in their laps.  Mickey
           looks like he's buried under a ton of sand just before high
           tide.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Think about this: What would you do
                        to be a success?  No, really think
                        about it.  What would you do?
                            (beat)
                        Anything, right?  Even if it meant
                        killing somebody?
                            (beat)
                        Yeah, of course.
                            (beat)
                        If only it were that easy.

           INT. OFFICE

           A MANAGER sits behind a desk studying Mickey's application
           with a dour expression.  Mickey looks like he's sitting on a
           nine-inch spike.

                                 MANAGER
                        Ah, Mister Kal-eh-geary.

                                 MICKEY
                        "Jerry." Kal-eh-jerry.

           The manager nods.

                                 MANAGER
                        You have quite a few gaps in your
                        employment history.

           The manager waits as Mickey considers a tactful response a
           good long time, then...
                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah.

           The manager considers a tactful response a good long time,
           then...

                                 MANAGER
                        And here on your application you
                        have a reference listed by the name
                        of Goo Goo.

           Mickey considers another tactful response, then...

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah.

           CLOSE ON -- LOUIS BASKIN (30)

           Smoking a cigarette and delicately manipulating a paintbrush. 
           Louis is intense and far away at the same time and looks in
           dire need of sunlight.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Love will make you do the damnedest
                        things.  Like get a job.

           Mickey ENTERS FRAME behind Louis wearing a black suit and
           tie.  He stares down at Louis' "canvas" with a critical eye.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It's only my first day, but so far
                        it's not that bad.  I wear a suit
                        and drive a cool car.  Like James
                        Bond.

           INT. MORGUE

           Mickey and Louis lean over A CORPSE that Louis is applying
           make-up to.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Sure, working in a funeral home
                        wouldn't have been my first choice,
                        but it's not that bad.  I guess I
                        just didn't think about having to be
                        around so many dead people but other
                        than that, it's just... the smell. 
                        Oh my god, that smell.  It smells
                        exactly like...
                            (at a loss)
                        Well, like something died.  Like a
                        lot of something died.
           Louis considers his work a good long time, then removes the
           cigarette from his mouth and places the butt end into the
           mouth of the corpse.

                                 LOUIS
                        What do you think?

           Mickey is horribly distracted by this.

                                 MICKEY
                        Huh?

                                 LOUIS
                        How's she look?

                                 MICKEY
                        Dead.

                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah, but would you fuck her?

           Mickey doesn't know how to answer.

                                 MICKEY
                        Huh?

                                 LOUIS
                        I mean, if she had a pulse.  As a
                        post mortem artist, that's sort of
                        the ultimate compliment when another
                        guy says he'd fuck your fix-up. 
                            (somewhere else)
                        Doesn't get any better than that.

                                 MICKEY
                        Oh?

           Louis picks a cheeseburger up off the chest of the corpse
           and takes a bite.  He holds the burger out to Mickey.

                                 LOUIS
                        Want some?

           Mickey is repulsed.

                                 MICKEY
                          No thanks.

           Louis puts the burger back on the corpse's belly, wipes
           condiment off of his hand and offers it to Mickey.

                                 LOUIS
                        I'm Louis.

           Mickey has no choice but to take his hand.

                                 MICKEY
                        Mickey.
                                 LOUIS
                        Nice to meet you, Mickey.  First
                        day?

           Mickey watches in horror as Louis pulls the cigarette out of
           the corpse's mouth and takes a drag.  He replaces the
           cigarette in the corpse's mouth, grabs his burger, rubs it
           in ketchup, and has another bite.

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah.
                            (re: burger)
                        That safe?

                                 LOUIS
                        What?

                                 MICKEY
                            (re: corpse)
                        Eating off of --

                                 LOUIS
                        Dead people are very clean.  Honestly,
                        they're usually cleaner than the
                        living.  With the exception of some
                        minor decomposition issues, they're
                        very hygienic.

           Louis rolls the end of the burger in ketchup, takes another
           bite, and places it back on the corpse.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        Did you know that you can't get a
                        sexually transmitted disease from a
                        corpse?

           Mickey winces.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        True.

           Louis pulls the cigarette out of the corpse's lips and has a
           long slow drag as he admires his work.

           Mickey is just barely able to keep his mouth closed as an
           involuntary dry heave rockets up his throat and fills his
           cheeks with hot air.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        Smell, huh?

           Mickey nods in the affirmative.  Catches his breath.

                                 MICKEY
                        I guess you get used to it?

           Louis nods.
                                 LOUIS
                        Naw, you never get used to it.

           Louis dry heaves.  Then again.  And again.  With his eyes
           all watery:

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        You figure out strategies to deal
                        with it, but you never get used to
                        it. 
                            (beat)
                        Have you met Pete yet?

           Mickey nods.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        He actually likes the smell.  You
                        come down here with a strong cup of
                        coffee and he'll make you stand in
                        the corner so it doesn't interrupt
                        the aroma.
                            (beat)
                        Guess he comes from a long line of
                        people who made their living off of
                        the dead.
                            (beat)
                        Word of advice: the accent makes him
                        sound a lot nicer than he really is,
                        but try not to piss him off.  I mean,
                        like, try really hard.
                            (beat; suddenly grave)
                        And Mickey...  Whatever you do, always
                        let him pick the music.

           A) shirt buttoned around a freshly shaven jaw

           B) belt cinching around a waist

           C) feet slipping into fine leather shoes

           D) The perfect knot of a tie tightened

           CLOSE ON - ENGLISH PETE

           The most sophisticated and elegantly dressed person you've
           ever seen as he adjusts the knot of his tie.

           INT. MORGUE

           Louis adjusts the knock of a tie a on a crisply dressed
           corpse.  Mickey watches.

                                 LOUIS
                        Business has been really good lately. 
                        Lots of finance guys.  Market must've
                        taken a dive again.

           And then, all of a sudden, Pete walks in: The perfectly
           tailored three-piece suit, the gentleman's hat, his sharp
           cornered briefcase, and the haze around him from the light
           in the doorway makes him look grander than life, almost
           surreal.  Magritte meets Madison Avenue.

           Mickey is struck dumb.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        I knew the first time I saw him that
                        it would change my life forever. 
                        Sometimes, the universe just wants
                        two things to be together.  Like
                        chocolate and peanut butter.

           Pete introduces himself to Mickey MOS in the B.G.

           Pete re-adjusts the knot on the tie of the freshly dressed
           corpse.

                                                                 CUT TO:

                        I need to make a quick stop before

                                 MICKEY
                        Okay, where to?

                        Yes.

           Mickey nods.  They ride along in silence.  Pete seems
           perfectly comfortable with this.  Mickey doesn't.  He
           occasionally peeks over to see if he can catch Pete's eye. 
           Nothing.

           INT. HEARSE -- DRIVING

           Mickey fishes in his pocket, pulls out a pack of cigarettes,
           shakes one out and pops it into his mouth.

           As Mickey brings the lighter to his mouth, he notices Pete
           staring at him.

                                 MICKEY
                            (cigarette in mouth)
                        This gonna bother you?

           Pete looks away.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        It doesn't bother me...

           Mickey flushes with relief and begins to light the cigarette.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        I just find it... disrespectful.

           Oops!  Mickey pulls the cigarette out of his mouth.  Tries
           to stamp out the tip with his fingers.

                                 MICKEY
                        I didn't mean to be disrespectful --

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Not to me... to yourself... and life
                        in general.
                            (beat)
                        You're young, Mickey.  You don't
                        understand how precious life is. 
                        Smoking shows a disregard and contempt
                        for the fragility of life.  It denies
                        you one of life's greatest pleasures:
                        realizing the majesty that exists in
                        each and every breath you'll ever
                        take.

           Pete turns his attention back out the window.  Mickey stares
           at him uncomfortably a good long time.
                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Okay, I know what you're thinking. 
                        But the thing of it is... He's right. 
                        I didn't know it at the time, but he
                        was dead on.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. STREGA RESTAURANT -- EVENING

           A quaint old Italian restaurant that looks like someone left
           it there at the turn of the century and then forgot to come
           back and get it.

           The hearse pulls to the curb out front.

           INT. HEARSE

           Pete opens his door and starts out.  Mickey follows suit. 
           Pete stops.

                                 PETE
                        Wait here.

                                 MICKEY
                        Oh, okay.  Yeah.

           Pete exits with A BRIEFCASE.  Mickey watches him enter the
           restaurant which doesn't seem to be open for business at
           this late hour.

           The second Pete is in, Mickey hops out of the car, frantically
           grabs his cigarettes, pops TWO in his mouth, lights up, and
           sucks them down for dear life.

           Mickey takes a second to "catch his breath." With each hit,
           calm melts over him.  He pulls out his cell phone and hits a
           speed dial button just as something catches his eye.

           Mickey looks THROUGH THE RESTAURANT'S WINDOW as he talks on
           the phone.  Pete is led to a small corner table.  Pete and
           another man sit.  This man is LITTLE HEART LOU, archetypal
           tough guy in a soft suit.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (on phone)
                        Jo, it's me.  Just making sure
                        everything is okay 'cause you never
                        called me back...

           THROUGH THE WINDOW -- Not a word is exchanged between Pete
           and Lou.  After a few moments Pete takes off his hat and
           gingerly places it onto the table.  After another moment, he
           slides the hat in front of Lou.

           Meanwhile, Mickey tries to brag inconspicuously throughout,
           but is just horrible at it:
                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (on phone)
                        I don't have a lot of time to talk
                        right now 'cause I'm at work, and
                        I'm gonna be busy 'cause some of the
                        other guys aren't pulling their weight
                        so, you know, everybody's leaning on
                        Mickey to make it happen...

           THROUGH THE WINDOW The other man picks up the hat and places
           two envelopes, one large and one small, underneath it.  He
           too waits a moment, then slides it back to Pete.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (on phone)
                        Anyway, I'm done at seven, maybe we
                        could go get some breakfast...

           Pete peeks into both envelopes and nods with satisfaction
           before dropping them into his briefcase.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (on phone)
                        And we can go anywhere you want --
                        cause I'm wearing a suit...

           Still without exchanging a word, Pete dons his hat and gets
           up to leave in what is obviously an oft practiced ritual. As
           soon as Pete is up, Mickey tosses his cigarettes and hops
           into the car.

           INT. HEARSE

                                 MICKEY
                            (on phone; frustrated)
                        Call me, okay?  Seriously.  Call me.
                            (beat)
                        Love you.  It's Mickey.

           Mickey frantically tucks his phone into his pocket like a
           kid trying to put away porn before his parents walk in.

           Pete hops in.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Where to?

           Pete opens the large envelope, barely slides a piece of paper
           out and reads:

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        177-42 Kinsey Drive.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. PATTERSON BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           The night sky's full moon casts an indigo hue over the unlit
           room as STANLEY PATTERSON frantically throws clothes and
           bric-a-brac into a suitcase sprawled across the bed.  Stanley
           looks middle-aged and middle management.

           A LOUD NOISE is heard O.S.

           Stanley startles, then freezes.

           He holds his breath and listens a good long time.

           Nothing.

           Stanley quickly closes his suitcase...

           INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Stanley stealthily hustles down the dark hall in his dark
           socks.

           INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           Stanley crosses the dark kitchen and opens the back door as
           if cracking a safe.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Stanley hustles across the driveway to the car.

           He gingerly opens the door with a nerve-wracked grimace.

           He pushes the suitcase into the passenger side and...

           INT. CAR

           Hops in and all but closes the door.  Stanley reaches for
           the ignition and... shit.

                                 STANLEY
                        Shit.

           No key.  Stanley clutches his head with panic and grief.

           He double checks his pockets.  Nothing.  He does it again. 
           Still nothing.

                                 STANLEY (CONT'D)
                        Fuck.

           He hyper-ventilates a moment, then reigns it in.

                                 STANLEY (CONT'D)
                            (to himself; sotto)
                        Be cool, Stanley.  Be cool.
           EXT. DRIVEWAY

           Stanley slides out of the car with the care and caution of a
           gazelle on the Serengeti.

           He ambles across the drive to the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN

           Stanley slowly opens the door and peers in cautiously.  His
           breaths are short and quick as he inches into the dark room.

           Stanley slides to the counter and gropes for the keys while
           keeping an eye on the entrance to the kitchen.

           Stanley stays quiet but becomes more frantic as he searches
           until... RATTLE, RATTLE.

           Stanley seizes in fear as

           THE LIGHTS POP ON.

           The kitchen door swings closed to reveal ENGLISH PETE standing
           behind it.  He holds Stanley's KEYS.

           Pete plants an automatic at Stanley's temple.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Be cool, Stanley.  Be cool.

           EXT. PATTERSON HOUSE

           Mickey is in the front seat of the hearse bobbing his head.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        I didn't know it yet, but apparently
                        I had gotten a job working for one
                        of the most prolific hit men that
                        ever lived.

           INT. HEARSE

           A decidedly un-soulful song plays a little too loud.  In
           fact, the song bears an uncanny resemblance to Nirvana's
           Smells Like Teen Spirit.

           Mickey rocks out.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        This guy was like The Beatles of
                        assassins for hire... he had more
                        hits than anyone else.

           Knock, knock, knock.  Mickey startles.  Pete stands outside
           the driver's side window.

           Mickey turns off the radio and rolls down the window.
                                 PETE
                        Let's go.

           EXT. PATTERSON HOUSE

           As Mickey and Pete cross the yard with an armload of stuff:

                                 PETE
                        Were you playing with the radio?

                                 MICKEY
                            (nervous)
                        Huh?

                                 PETE
                        The radio.  Where you playing with
                        the radio?

                                 MICKEY
                            (more nervous)
                        No, ahhhh, I was just -- I turned on
                        the -- to see what time -- and --

                                 PETE
                        Mickey, don't ever touch the radio
                        again.  Please.
                            (beat; cold and quiet)
                        Or I'll kill you.

           Mickey shoots him a look.  Was that for real or is Pete going
           to laugh and let him off the hook?  There is no laughing.

           INT. PATTERSON HOUSE -- KITCHEN

           Mickey and Pete stand over Stanley who is sprawled on the
           floor in a pool of blood.  They wear "shower cap" booties
           around their shoes as not to contaminate the scene.

                                 MICKEY
                        Holy shit.
                            (breathless)
                        This guy really died, huh?

           Pete shoots him a look.  What kind of observation is that?

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Put the gloves on, then open the bag
                        as close to the body as you can
                        without getting blood on it.

           Mickey puts the gloves on and spreads out the bag.  Pete
           stands at Stanley's feet and directs Mickey to stand by the
           head. 

           As Pete talks, Mickey notices that the pool of blood is slowly
           moving toward his feet.
           Mickey is terribly distracted by this.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Okay, I know, in retrospect, I should
                        have been a little a bit more
                        concerned about this.  But until
                        you've seen your first real, live
                        dead body, well, you don't know how
                        you'll act.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Grab him underneath the shoulders. 
                        Don't try to lift straight up, just
                        use the body weight and momentum to
                        swing him toward the bag.  Okay?  On
                        three.

           Mickey grabs Stanley underneath the shoulders.  Pete grabs
           his ankles.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        One.  Two.  Three.

           As they begin lifting the body, Mickey sees Stanley's eyes
           slowly open.

           TWHOCK!  Stanley's head smacks the floor as Mickey drops the
           body and back peddles into the counter.

           Pete looks up like someone just peed in his Cheerios.

           Mickey points.

           Pete sees that Stanley's eyes are wide open.  Pete let's out
           an exasperated sigh, he's not sure what to do about this.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                            (not very convincing)
                        Involuntary reflex.  Not uncommon.

           Stanley let's out a moan:  "Mmmmmmmmm."

           Mickey looks at Pete.  Explain that one.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        Mickey, would you go to the car and
                        get another pair of gloves for me.

           Mickey nods and tiptoes around the body and blood. The second
           Mickey is out the door, Pete kneels over Stanley and shakes
           an admonishing index finger at him.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        Naughty, naughty.
           Pete reaches down and pinches Stanley's nose shut with two
           fingers, then draws his perfectly folded pocket square and
           ever so gently and gingerly stuffs it into Stanley's mouth.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HEARSE - MOVING

           Mickey looks like he's seen a ghost.  Or at least a dead
           body.  Pete looks like they're coming home from a day at the
           beach.

           Somehow, against all odds, Pete has found a old R&B song
           even more soulful than the last one.  Pete is into it. 
           Really, really into it.  He sways and lip-synches along. 
           After a bit:

                                 PETE
                        If this is what three hundred years
                        of oppression does to you, enslave
                        me.

           His spirit swoons.

                                 PETE (CONT'D)
                        Do you hear that, Mickey? Do you
                        hear that?

           Mickey's not sure if he hears "that" or not.

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Can you feel it?

           Again Mickey's not sure.

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah.  I think so.

           Pete inhales, closes his eyes, and his face crumples with
           intense grief.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        It's so -- beautiful.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Makes you wonder if this guy ever
                        got laid.

           Pete reigns it back in.  A thin smile crosses his lips as he
           reminisces, but he still seems somehow so vulnerable.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        The first time I heard soul music, 
                        I ran to the record store, got the
                                 (MORE)
                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        album and ran all the way home. 
                        More than six miles.  I listened to
                        the whole thing over and over and
                        over.  I couldn't even eat that night. 
                        Didn't need to...  because for the
                        first time in my life I felt full. 
                        Like I would burst.  And right then
                        and there I understood that music
                        and knew that no one would ever
                        understand me the way it did.  It
                        turned my mother, my brothers, my
                        neighbors, into complete strangers.
                            (beat)
                        And when I finished, sitting there,
                        staring at that album cover, with
                        the sun coming up -- I hated God for
                        not making me black.  For dangling
                        that in front of me and letting me
                        witness what it meant to be
                        authentic... but making me realize
                        that I could never be that.
                            (beat)
                        To let me feel that, be touched and
                        stirred like that... but never be
                        able to posses it. 
                            (considers)
                        Crueler than any prank the devil
                        could ever play.

           For once, Mickey has nothing to say, even in voice over. 
           Pete is suddenly far away and melancholy.  Completely
           vulnerable.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        It's rare to find something you truly
                        feel passionate about in this life. 
                        But when you do, if you do, don't
                        ever give it up or let it go for
                        anyone.  Not your mother, your
                        country, even God.

           Pete's eyes slowly close and his face wrinkles with intense
           emotion and longing.

           Mickey stares at Pete, this curious creature, a good long
           time before fixing his eyes back on the road and his thoughts
           back on himself.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. MICKEY'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           Mickey looks like he fell off a four story building and landed
           in bed.  He is out cold.

           His door swings open:
                                 MICKEY'S MOM
                        Jesus Christ, Mickey, it's smells
                        like something died in here.

           Mickey startles awake.  Mrs. Kalligheri sniffs at the air a
           couple more times and winces.

                                 MICKEY'S MOM (CONT'D)
                            (chastising)
                        I swear to God, I find out you're
                        sister's right and you really have
                        been serial killing or murdering
                        prostitutes -- IN MY HOUSE!
                            (points accusing finger)
                        I swear to God...
                            (beat)
                        Open a window for Christ's sake. 

           She slams the door.

           Mickey's nose curls and he winces.  He grabs his undershirt
           and pulls it to his nose.  He reflexively pulls away with a
           grimace.

           Mickey stumbles out of bed and opens a window.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        There's something about death.  It
                        leaves a smell on you and a taste in
                        your mouth that you just can't get
                        rid of.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. SHOWER

           Still half asleep, Mickey soaps and lathers with his eyes
           closed.

           We hear a FLUSH O.S. and Mickey immediately jumps and contorts
           in pain as he is scalded with hot water.

                                 MICKEY
                        Owwww!  Jesus Christ!

           INT. BATHROOM

           Tracy, holding a diet coke and a magazine, pulls herself off
           the toilet and draws her drawers up.

                                 TRACY
                            (flat; insincere)
                        Sorry, had to drop a deuce.

           She exits.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. MICKEY'S BEDROOM

           Mickey's hair is still wet from the shower as he dresses for
           work at a more than leisurely pace.

           A radio is playing something hard and rocking in the B.G. 
           Mickey can't quite get into it.  In fact, he seems distracted
           by it, his attention drifting to the radio over and over as
           he tries to do other stuff.

           Mickey suddenly crosses to the radio and -- like his hand
           had a will of its own -- turns the dial.  Past hip hop. 
           Past country.  Past talk.  And finds a soul station.

           There is a blistering soul song warbling the air waves. 
           Whomever the man singing is, he's really feeling it.

           Mickey is affected.  Pierced to the core of his being.  He's
           not sure if he likes the way it's making him feel, but he
           can't resist it.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HEARSE -- DRIVING

           Mickey is behind the wheel and on the phone.

                                 MICKEY
                            (to himself)
                        Come on, Jo.

           Mickey hangs up and tries again.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (to himself)
                        Come on, come on, come on.

           Her voicemail picks-up.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (into phone)
                        Hey, it's me.  What are you doing? 
                        How come you're not answering your
                        phone.
                            (beat; tries to soften
                             tone)
                        Look, I gotta go to work soon, but I
                        want to see you.  I can come by or...
                            (beat)
                        Just call me when you get this, okay? 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. JO'S HOUSE

           Mickey is parked across the street from Jo's house with his
           phone in hand.  He dials.
           And as he's watching, a brand new, sparkling WHITE BMW pulls
           up out front with a brand new, sparkling white guy in it.(Yes,
           the same BMW and guy we saw Jo with when we met her). 
           Mickey's brow furrows.

           We HEAR JO'S VOICEMAIL BEEP ON MICKEY'S PHONE as she comes
           out of her house and gets into the WHITE BMW.

           In shock and momentarily unaware that the phone is hovering
           by his mouth:

                                 MICKEY
                        What the fuck?  Are you fucking
                        kidding me?  You whore.

           And on "whore," Mickey suddenly becomes aware of the phone
           in his hand.  He slowly brings the phone to his ear.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (on phone)
                        Hey... Ahhhh.... Ahhhh.... it's
                        Mickey.  Okay, ah, call me?  Love
                        you, Sweetie, bye.

           Mickey is the poster child for chagrin as we:

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. MORGUE

           Mickey and Louis.  Louis works on another cadaver.  He smokes
           and eats a burrito, with fork and knife, off of the corpse's
           midsection.  Mickey is lost in thought and painfully
           distracted throughout.

           Louis stops to admire his work.

                                 LOUIS
                        Well, what do you think?

                                 MICKEY
                        Huh?

                                 LOUIS
                            (indicates corpse)
                        How's she look?

           Mickey gives the corpse a cursory glance.

                                 MICKEY
                        I'd fuck her.

           Louis lights up.

                                 LOUIS
                            (genuinely touched)
                        Really?  Thanks, man.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                            (changing pace)
                        Hey, I'm getting pretty full, you
                        want some?

           Mickey nods no.  Louis goes back to putting on some finishing
           touches.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        I really like having you here, Mickey.

           Mickey is too caught up in himself to be engaged.  Doesn't
           matter to Louis, whose attention is with the cadaver anyway.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        So does Pete.  He said you were a
                        good egg.
                            (beat)
                        Although -- did you touch his radio?

           This gets Mickey's attention.  Louis stops what he's doing
           and turns to Mickey.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        Hey Mickey, I wasn't kidding about
                        that.  It's why the last guy's not
                        around anymore.

                                 MICKEY
                        What do you mean "not around anymore?"

                                 ENGLISH PETE (O.S.)
                        Are we ready?

           Mickey and Louis startle.  They turn to see Pete standing in
           the doorway.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. STREGA

           The hearse is parked out front.  Mickey is outside smoking a
           cigarette.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        I knew I shouldn't do what I was
                        about to do even before I did it. 
                        But I couldn't help myself...

           Mickey discreetly sidles up to the restaurants window and
           peeks inside.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Ever since I was little, I've had
                        this voice in my head that dares me
                        to do stuff.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I don't mean a shoot the president
                        or a Beatle kind of voice.  I just
                        mean that voice you talk to yourself
                        with when you're trying to figure
                        something out.

           He sees Pete and Lou at the table performing the same ritual:
           the hat is doffed and slid, the envelopes are placed
           underneath it, the hat is slid back.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Mine is always daring me to do stuff. 
                        It started out small, stuff like
                        burping in class and farting in
                        church. But then it started daring
                        me to do stuff that scared the shit
                        out of me just thinking about it. 
                        But the funny thing is, when you
                        take the dare, and you always do, it
                        feels like you've accomplished
                        something.  You're not afraid of
                        that thing anymore, even if you get
                        in trouble for it.

           The ritual is exactly the same except...

           Lou looks up and catches Mickey's eye.  Lou stiffens.

           Busted.  Mickey freezes: a deer in headlights.

           Lou says something and we see... 

           Pete turn in his seat.  He holds his gaze on Mickey then
           turns and says something to Lou.  Lou's nods and his demeanor
           suddenly relaxes.

           Mickey stamps out his cigarette and heads back to the hearse. 
           His discomfort is manifest.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HEARSE -- MOVING

           Mickey and Pete drive in silence.  There is an obvious tension
           between them.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                            (staring out the window)
                        Curiosity killed the cat.

                                 MICKEY
                        What?

           Still staring out the window, but now over-enunciating:

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Curiosity-killed-the-cat.
           Mickey doesn't know what to say.  Pete has nothing else to
           say.  They just drive.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. MERRICK HOUSE

           The hearse pulls up and stops.

           INT. HEARSE

           Pete pulls two surgical gloves from his briefcase and begins
           to put them on.

                                 MICKEY
                        I think it's actually up there, you
                        want me to --

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        This is fine.

           Pete finishes getting the gloves on, locks his case and grabs
           the door handle.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        Wait here.

                                 MICKEY
                        Sure you don't want me to carry
                        something or --

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        No.  Wait.

           He is out the door.

           Mickey watches Pete cross the front yard and go around to
           the back of the house.

           Mickey's expression tells us that he thinks this is weird,
           but he let's it go. He pulls his phone and tries to call Jo. 
           Nothing. He tries again.  Again nothing.  Frustrated he
           pockets the phone and doesn't know what to do with himself.

           He stares at the radio.  Wants to soooooo badly, but knows
           he shouldn't.  He settles back into his seat and tries to
           make himself comfortable.  But can't.

           EXT. HEARSE

           Mickey hops out and lights up.  He is absently staring at
           the house when he startles at the sight and sound of two
           POPS and MUZZLE FLASHES in an upstairs window.

           Mickey panicks.

                                 MICKEY
                        Oh no...
           He jumps in the car.  Starts the engine.  Looks back at the
           house.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Shit!

           EXT. CAR

           He jumps back out and crosses the yard.

           EXT. MERRICK HOUSE -- BACKYARD

           Mickey comes around the corner and slams into Pete.

                                 MICKEY
                        You okay?

           Pete throws him a queer look.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Of course.
                            (beat)
                        Why aren't you in the car?

                                 MICKEY
                        I thought I heard a --

           Mickey's sentence is abbreviated by a distraction: Pete has
           blood splatter on his white shirt. 

           Pete follows Mickey's sight line and sees the blood splatter
           that has caught Mickey's attention.  Mickey considers Pete
           and his words very carefully.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Nothing.

           Pete dissects Mickey with his gaze a good long time.  As
           Mickey starts to melt...

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        This is a very messy business, Mickey.

           Mickey has nothing to say.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        Let's go get some bags.

           Pete heads to the hearse.  Mickey watches him for a bit before
           following him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MICKEY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Mickey lies in the dark with his eyes wide open.  Angst ridden
           and confused, he can't sleep.  He tosses.  He turns.
           He gives up and then starts all over again.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. MORGUE -- MORNING

           Mickey and Louis.  Again Louis is toiling away on a cadaver. 
           He intermittently chomps on a slice of pizza as he works on
           the cadaver.

                                 MICKEY
                        How come we had to be in so early
                        today?

                                 LOUIS
                        We're getting slammed.  No such thing
                        as a moratorium on death.

           Engaged by his work, Louis talks at him rather than to him
           throughout:

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                            (absently)
                        What a waste.

           Mickey looks the young woman over.

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah, she looks pretty young.

                                 LOUIS.
                        Huh?  Oh.  No, I mean her tits. 
                        Look at those things.

           The cadaver has silicone monuments that obviously have a
           much longer expiration date than their owner.

                                 LOUIS
                        Probably cost a fortune.  And the
                        shelf life on these things -- they
                        still have years of happiness to
                        bring, but they're just gonna be
                        thrown away.  What a waste.

           Mickey is a little weirded-out by Louis' observation.  He
           wanders the morgue and is suddenly struck still.  He stares
           down at a body on a table.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        We donate organs, right?  Why not
                        tits?  Tits make everybody happy...
                        Every minute of every day. What the
                        fuck do kidneys do?
                            (despondent)
                        What a waste.

           Upon closer inspection, we see that Mickey is staring at
           STANLEY PATTERSON'S BODY.
                                 MICKEY
                        Hey Louis.

                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah?

                                 MICKEY
                        What's happening with this one?

           Louis stands and looks over.

                                 LOUIS
                        Smoke house.

                                 MICKEY
                        Cremated?

           Louis nods.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        He moaned when we picked him up.

           Louis double takes.

                                 LOUIS
                        Moaned?

                                 MICKEY
                        Guess you hear that all the time --

                                 LOUIS
                        A moan?  No.

           Mickey looks up with shock and concern... and notices Pete
           standing in the doorway.

           As they stare at each other in silence.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Where was that voice in my head when
                        I really needed it?  Why wasn't it
                        double-dog daring me to run the fuck
                        out of there as fast as I could?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HEARSE

           Mickey and Pete ride along in silence.  Awkward.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. STREGA

           Pete sits at a small table with Lou.  They go through the
           motions of their oft practiced ritual: Pete doffs the hat,
           slides it to Lou, Lou places the envelopes beneath it, slides
           it back.
           INT. HEARSE

           Mickey sits in the car anxious as hell.  He is incredibly
           agitated and absentmindedly TURNS ON THE RADIO AND TURNS THE
           DIAL.

           It only takes him a second to realize what he's done.  Oh
           shit, what station was it on?  He jumps from station to
           station, finds something vaguely soulful and quickly turns
           the radio off.

           Click.  Pete opens the door and hops in.

                                 PETE
                        Let's go.

           EXT. HEARSE

           They pull away from the curb and come to stop at the traffic
           light at the end of the block.

           INT. HEARSE

           Pete turns on the radio on and a precision country twang
           drifts through the speakers:

                                 SONG
                        "Oh baby, when you left me, the light
                        in our trailer, never went back on,
                        and since you left me, my heart's
                        been dead and gone..."

           Pete stiffens.  Mickey does too.  Pete turns ashen.  Mickey
           does too.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Did you touch the radio?

           Mickey nods no.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        Mickey, if you did it, just admit it
                        and I won't be mad.  But if you lie
                        to me --

           Mickey is still hesitant, then...

                                 MICKEY
                        It was an accident, I didn't mean to --

           Mickey's sentence is abbreviated by Pete opening the door
           and exiting the car.

           EXT. HEARSE

           WE FOLLOW Pete as he walks around the back of the car and
           pulls a BIG BAD ASS GUN from his shoulder holster.
           Blocked the by car in front of him, Mickey has few options
           but to lock the door and squirm as Pete steps around to the
           driver's side window.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)

                        your eyes.

           look of menace, we:

                        Not me.  All I can think about in
                        the last seconds of my life is whether
                        Jo, my cheating whore of a girlfriend,
                        will come to my funeral... in a brand
                        new, sparkling white BMW.

           CLOSE ON ENGLISH PETE'S CRUEL EYES as...

           WHAM!!!!!

           Pete's body is violently thrown out of frame as he is hit by
           a car.

           SCREEEEECH!!!!  The car's tires wail as it shudders to a
           stop.

           It takes Mickey a second to realize it wasn't him.  He's
           still here.

           Mickey steps out of the car and sees...

           Pete sprawled in the middle of the road with the offending
           car ten yards past him.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It's funny how your luck can change
                        just like that...

           As Mickey steps forward to check on Pete...

           TWO MEN jump out of the car and run to Pete...

           They stand over him and assess his condition.  Dead or alive?

           And then blast him full of lead: BAM BAM BAM BAM

           The car whips into reverse and slides to a stop inches from
           Pete's body before the last bullet is fired.

           Mickey jumps back in shock.
           The TRUNK pops open...

           The men unceremoniously dump Pete's body into the trunk,
           jump into the back, and tear off.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Holy shit.

                        Holy shit.

           PETE'S HAT lays in the middle of the road.

           Instantly, Mickey is drawn to it like a cat to a ball of
           string.  He retrieves it, brushes it off and...

           SCHREECH!!!  HONK!!!

           Mickey is startled out of his fugue state by the oncoming
           traffic and hustles back to the hearse.

           As he moves around to shut Pete's open door, he sees Lou
           come out onto the sidewalk from the restaurant. Lou sees him
           too.  Sees that Mickey is holding THE HAT.  As they exchange
           a look of uncertainty with one another, we:

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HEARSE -- DRVING

           Mickey is still in shock, still trying to catch his breath
           when he looks over and sees...

           THE BRIEFCASE resting in the passenger's seat.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INDUSTRIAL PARK -- DAY

           An abandoned industrial park.  The hearse is parked all by
           itself in the middle of a vast and depleted wasteland.

           INT. HEARSE

           Mickey cautiously checks over each shoulder even though there
           is no one in sight as far as the eye can see.

           He leans into the passenger's seat and opens the briefcase. 
           It is full of money.  Lots of money.

           Mickey smiles.  Smiles big.  He starts counting the money.

                        capitalist desire.
                            (beat)
                        Don't get me wrong, I felt horrible
                        about what happened to Pete... at
                        least until I saw all of that money! 
                        That's the thing about a briefcase
                        full of money, it's makes you feel
                        fucking great.
                            (beat)
                        I know, you're thinking I shouldn't
                        take the money.  You're thinking
                        that if I take it and there's trouble,
                        I deserve whatever I get.  Yeah, I
                        know.  But here's the difference
                        between me and you.  I've got it all
                        figured out.  So before I rushed
                        into any rash decisions, I did the
                        first thing any red blooded rational
                        human being would do... I counted
                        it!
                            (beat)
                        Thirty.  Thousand.  Dollars.  Thirty
                        thousand dollars... all at once,
                        right there in my lap.  That's a lot
                        of money.  No, it's more than a lot
                        of money, it's change your life money. 
                        Shit, for thirty thousand dollars
                        there pretty much wasn't anything
                        you couldn't replace or fix in your
                        life.  Got a lousy car?  Buy a new
                        one.  Lousy job?  Quit.  Lousy teeth? 
                        Buy straight ones.  Lousy dick.  Buy
                        a hard one?  Even if you had a lousy
                        girlfriend, with thirty grand... you
                        just might be able to make her happy.

           Mickey repacks the money and opens the large envelope. 
           Inside: pictures of a man and a sheet of paper dense with
           information.  Mickey studies the paper closely.  It's a
           contract.  Yeah, that kind of contract.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. JO'S BEDROOM

           Jo is propped up at the head of the bed casually dressed in
           tight shorts and an even tighter t-shirt.  Mickey stands at
           the foot of the bed, scoops the money out of his jacket, and
           dumps it onto the bed.

           Jo is stunned.  After catching her breath:

                                 JO
                        Where did this come from?

           Mickey struggles to get the words out of his mouth throughout:
                                 MICKEY
                            (nervous)
                        Well... someone.. sort of... died.

                                 JO
                        What?

                                 MICKEY
                            (more nervous)
                        He's dead... cuz... I turned on the
                        radio... and I didn't realize...

                                 JO
                        Is this your money?

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah... I guess --

                                 JO
                        Mickey!  Where-the-fuck-did-it-come-
                        from?

                                 MICKEY
                            (stammering)
                        He's was mad because... but I
                        didn't... I was just...  And it was
                        a professional hit...

           We see Jo doing the math.

                                 JO
                        Oh my god.  You mean...

           Mickey nods yes.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        You killed someone?

           Mickey's brow furrows.  That's not what he meant.  He nods
           no and tries to explain...

                                 MICKEY
                        No.. it was... an acci --

           But Jo is already running with it... and way ahead of him.

                                 JO
                        Oh my God.
                            (chant)
                        Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...

                                 MICKEY
                        I know, babe, but it --

                                 JO
                        That makes me so fuckin' hot.
           Just as Mickey double takes, Jo attacks him with a lust and
           passion usually only seen in large game cats during mating
           season.

           Jo tears at his clothes.  She is completely manic, out of
           control and into it.  Mickey surrenders...  And they make
           hot, sweaty, dirty love.  Monkey love.  Murder love.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Wow.  We had been doing this for
                        years, and it was always good, but
                        this time it was different.  Better. 
                        And not just because I didn't have
                        to beg her to put her finger in my a--
                        anyway, you get the point, all of a
                        sudden, Jo was fucking me like she
                        owed me money.  And she didn't even
                        owe me money.  It was like as many
                        times as we'd done it before, she
                        never really respected me.  Never
                        fucked me with an eye on the future. 
                        But now, because she thought I took
                        a life, she wanted to make a life
                        with me.  And if you think about it
                        for a minute, it's not that weird. 
                        Serial killers get proposals from
                        thousands of women.  No bullshit. 
                        Power is an aphrodisiac.  Well, what's
                        more powerful than taking a life?

           INT. JO'S BEDROOM

           Mickey lies in bed smoking a cigarette.  He looks like he
           was dropped through a wind tunnel at 200mph and just barely
           survived.  But he looks blissfully, sublimely happy about
           it.  Jo is snuggled onto his chest with a dreamy post coital
           glow in her eyes.

                                 JO
                            (dreamily)
                        How'd you do it?

                                 MICKEY
                            (somewhere else)
                        Huh?

                                 JO
                        How'd he die?

                                 MICKEY
                            (distracted by fatigue)
                        Car.

                                 JO
                        What?
           Not what she wanted to hear.  Mickey realizes and tries to
           recover...

                                 MICKEY
                        I mean, run over...

                                 JO
                            (a little excited)
                        Really?

                                 MICKEY
                            (rolling with it)
                        Then shot.

                                 JO
                            (charged)
                        Oh my god.

           Jo is beside herself.  Crackling with sexual energy and
           breathing heavily, she violently grabs Mickey:

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I fucking love you.

           This is followed by a violent kiss..  and love making in the
           third degree.

           As Jo humps Mickey's brains out in the B.G.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Okay, I know what you're thinking...
                        But I love her and a lot of people
                        have done a lot of weird things for
                        love, why shouldn't murder be one of
                        them?

           INT. JO'S BEDROOM

           Mickey and Jo bask in post-coital bliss.  Mickey is
           practically cross-eyed.  No one should feel this much pleasure
           without a permit.  Jo languidly runs her nails across his
           chest.

                                 JO
                            (dreamy baby doll
                             voice)
                        You know what I really want to do,
                        Mickey?

           He nods no with a dumb smile on his face.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I want to fuck you again, Mickey,
                        and I want to make you see God.
           Mickey looks like he just found out he won the lottery.  And
           doesn't have to pay taxes on it.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                            (more baby doll)
                        Then you know what I want to do?

           Mickey nods no, but boy is he along for the ride.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Buy a pair of shoes, baby.  Buy a
                        pair of shoes.

           As she bites Mickey's lip, we...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT.  BURKSTOWN SHOPPING PLAZA

           Stores galore.  A  monument to consumer culture and a
           shopaholic's wet dream.

           Mickey and Jo stroll through the mall arm-in-arm.  Jo sips
           from a super-sized soda and has shopping bags FULL OF SHOE
           BOXES slung over her arm.  She also has a big smile on her
           face.  Mickey looks nauseous.

                                 JO
                        What's the matter, baby?  You're
                        sweating?

                                 MICKEY
                        Sixty-four hundred dollars for three
                        pairs of shoes?

                                 JO
                        Mickey, they're not shoes, they're
                        Louboutin.

                                 MICKEY
                        Jesus Christ, babe, for that much
                        they should come with four tires and
                        a fifty thousand mile warranty.

                                 JO
                        You don't like them?

           Mickey knows to tread lightly.

                                 MICKEY
                        I didn't say that --

                                 JO
                        They make me feel sexy, babe.  Don't
                        you want me to feel sexy?

           Mickey gives a begrudging nod as they exit the mall into the
           EXT. BURKSTOWN SHOPPING PLAZA PARKING LOT

           As they cross the enormous lot:

                                 JO
                        You know what else they make me feel?

           Mickey nods.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Dirty.  Really dirty.  Like I want
                        to go get some porn.

           Mickey grimaces at the word "porn" and his expression
           vacillates with indecision.  Jo leans into Mickey's ear and
           gets herself increasingly worked up as she talks.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Yeah Mickey, let's go get some porn. 
                        A lot of porn.  Nasty porn.  The
                        kind that's gonna make us feel ashamed
                        just watching it.

           As she throws wild eyes and the gauntlet down in front of
           Mickey:

                                 MICKEY
                            (begrudging)
                        Yeah, okay.  But can we get something
                        that doesn't only have black guys in
                        it this time?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. HEARSE

           Mickey loads Jo's bags around an enormous casket.

                                 JO
                        Hurry up!

           As Mickey closes the back door and starts to make his way
           around to the driver's side there is a HONK.  He turns and
           sees AN OVER-SIZED CADILLAC hovering in the aisle behind
           him.

           A big thick fella with forearms that would make a gorilla
           jealous leans out the passenger side window.  The only thing
           on the planet thicker than his forearms is his accent.

                                 FOREARMS
                        Yo!  You leaving?

                                 MICKEY
                        It's gonna be a couple of minutes.
           Mickey hustles into the car.

                                 FOREARMS
                        Of course.

           And the Caddy drifts off.

           INT. HEARSE

           Jo is pulling a pair of Louboutin's out of the box -- and
           they look dangerous -- while Mickey peels off his Jacket.

                                 JO
                        Do you want to fuck me in my new
                        Louboutin's, baby?

                                 MICKEY
                            (school boy shy)
                        Yes.

                                 JO
                        And nothing else?

                                 MICKEY
                        Yes.

           They tear at their own and each others clothes in a confused
           frenzy of passion when WONK!  The car hiccups forward as we
           hear the crunch of metal.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Fuck.

           EXT. BURKSTOWN SHOPPING PLAZA PARKING LOT

           Mickey hops out of the hearse half-dressed and tries to
           straighten his clothes as he walks to the back of the car to
           see what the trouble is.

           And the trouble is...  The Cadillac and its owner with the
           preternatural forearms.  His professional name is "PEPPER,"
           but his friends call him "one scary motherfucker."

           The Cadillac has been driven squarely into the fender of the
           hearse and has made a big dent.  The Caddy doesn't have a
           scratch.  Three of Peppers buddies, obviously returning from
           a Neanderthal convention and each bigger and scarier looking
           than the next, lean out the windows looking bored.

           Pepper is already on top of Mickey by the time he rounds the
           corner.

                                 PEPPER
                        Look what you did to my car!

                                 MICKEY
                        What?
                                 PEPPER
                        You fucking totaled it.

                                 MICKEY
                        I wasn't even moving.

                                 PEPPER
                        Well Jesus Christ, why didn't you
                        move!

           Another monument to menace, better known as PIG, exits the
           Cadillac and walks to the other side of Mickey. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I was parked!  I didn't even have
                        the keys in it yet.

                                 PEPPER
                        And you think that makes you a good
                        driver?

                                 MICKEY
                        No, but I wasn't moving, how could --

                                 PEPPER
                            (suddenly the sage)
                        Listen.  If there's one thing I've
                        learned in life, it's that you can't
                        just stand around with your legs
                        open and not expect me to kick you
                        in the balls... Mickey.

           Before Mickey can decipher the real world relevance of the
           threat, he double-takes at the mention of his name.

           Unfortunately, by the time he sees that Pepper's foot is a
           high speed train coming at his crotch, all he has time to do
           is consider how painful it will be.

           POW!  Right in the sweet spot.  And from the look on Mickey's
           face we can see that however painful he thought the kick
           would be, he greatly underestimated it.

           As Mickey falls to the ground in SLOW MOTION we see that his
           body is out cold before his brain... but not for long.

           As Mickey hits the ground his arms, legs, and head stiffen
           and point toward the sky.  KO'd.

           Pig turns to Pepper, turns his lip out and nods his
           appreciation.  Pig and Pepper then promptly bend over and
           grab Mickey from either end like a big sack.

                                 PIG
                        Hate it when they go all stiff.

                                 PEPPER
                        So what.
                                 PIG
                        Hard to get in the trunk.

           And throw him into the ALREADY OPEN TRUNK.

           MICKEY'S POV - INSIDE THE TRUNK

           As Pig and Pepper casually slam the lid and his world goes
           dark.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        It's funny, how your luck can change
                        just like that.

                                                                  CUT TO

           INT.  BASEMENT

           Mickey stands in a roomful of wise guys: PIG, PEPPER, BRICK,
           TINY, SKINNY JOE, LITTLE HEART LOU, AND BATMAN.

           Mickey stands next to Skinny Joe as most of the gang putters
           around preparing for something illegal in the background. 
           Batman casually holds a baseball bat and occasionally takes
           a batting stance as he addresses Mickey and Skinny Joe.

                                 BATMAN
                        You know why they call me Batman? 
                        In high school, I was an All-Star. 
                        What's the name of that new kid the
                        Sox just signed?

           No one acknowledges his query.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        The black one.

           The guys all look confused.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                            (mocking)
                        Oh, you mean the black baseball
                        player?

                                 BATMAN
                        Yeah!  What's his name.  Elmore or
                        something.  Signed him for sixty
                        mil.  I looked-up his high school
                        batting average on the internet.  My 
                        RBI was better than his.  And I wasn't
                        on no fuckin' steroids.
                            (beat)
                        I coulda been on baseball cards, but
                        they didn't have no scouts coming to
                        my neighborhood.

           Batman takes a moment to admire a memory.
                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Joey.

                                 SKINNY JOE
                        Yeah, Jimmy?

                                 BATMAN
                        You're fired.

           WHACK!!!

           He slams Skinny Joe in the head...

           Blood splatters all over Mickey's face.

           The guys all hoot and holler.

                        LITTLE HEART LOU
                                                    BRICK
                Whoa!!!
                                             HO!!!

           FREDDO "FETCH" MIGNON enters with a disheveled appearance
           that is well cultivated and a beloved "Donnie Brasco" leather
           jacket which he doesn't let anyone touch in spite of his
           unbearable close talking throughout.

                                 FETCH
                        What'd I miss?

                                 TINY
                            (to Batman)
                        Not bad, Jimmy.

           Batman nods proudly.

                                 BATMAN
                        Some things you never lose.

                                 FETCH
                        What'd I miss?

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                        A fuckin' line drive right down the
                        middle.

           Batman looks stricken.

                                 BATMAN
                        What?  That was out of the fuckin'
                        park.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                            (shrugs)
                        Jimmy, you caught him a little low
                        and on the inside.

           Batman fumes.
                                 BATMAN
                            (to Mickey)
                        Hey... What's your name?

                                 MICKEY
                        Michaelangelo.

                                 BATMAN
                        Like the famous guy?

                                 MICKEY
                            (nods)
                        But everybody calls me Mickey.

                                 BATMAN
                        Mickey, tell this fuckin' mug, was
                        it out of the park or was it out of
                        the park?

           Mickey nods.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           He casually throws the bat over his shoulder.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey Mickey --

                                 MICKEY
                        Huh --

                                 BATMAN
                        Do me a favor?

           Mickey nods.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Hold still.

           Mickey goes wide-eyed as Batman winds into a swing.  Little
           Heart Lou and Tiny jump in and check Batman's swing at the
           last second.

                        LITTLE HEART LOU
                                                    TINY
                Whoa.
                                             Whoa.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                        Jimmy, not him.

                                 BATMAN
                        Oh.  I just thought --

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                        No.  He's with the English remember? 
                        We gotta get the Bustamante situation
                        sorted.
           They all turn to Mickey with menacing stares.

           ECU ON THE WISE GUYS' FACES

           They're not friendly faces. They ask questions in unison.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        There is no manual or textbook that
                        you read as a kid that tells you
                        what to do if you find yourself in a
                        roomful of men who fire people with
                        baseball bats.  Magazines don't write
                        articles about this and fathers don't
                        put their sons on knees and tell
                        them what they did when they were in
                        this exact same situation.
                            (beat)
                        They wanted answers from me.  Answer
                        I didn't have.

           Little Heart Lou snaps his fingers in Mickey's face.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                        I want some answers from you!

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        I could tell them the truth.  I should
                        tell them the truth.  I wanted to
                        tell them the truth... but then I
                        remembered that I was in a basement
                        with six guys that I stole thirty
                        thousand dollars from.  Thirty
                        thousand dollars that I couldn't
                        give back.  Six guys that could kill
                        me.  Six guys that should kill me. 
                        Six guys that wanted to kill me.

           We watch Mickey's Adam's apple trace down his throat as he
           swallows hard and sweat begins to dimple his brow.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                        This is the last fucking time I'm
                        going to ask you!  Why is that
                        goddamned, no-good, green-eyed,
                        buffalo wrestling, fuckwit Vincent
                        Bustamante still walking this planet

                        A. I could pray.  But God didn't owe
                        me any favors.

                        already left that option in the trunk
                        of Pepper's Caddy.

           Batman walks up behind Little Heart Lou intently wiping down

                        So what did I do?  I figured out
                        right there and then, I didn't need
                        to be the smartest guy in the world
                        to get out of this, I just needed to
                        be the smartest guy in the room. So
                        I lied.  Lied like Las Vegas. About
                        everything.  Like my life counted on
                        it.  And well, it did.

           We see Mickey talking fast, real fast.  If his mouth had tap
           shoes it could star in an old Fred Astaire movie.  The guys
           listen and nod with critical and judging eyes.

                        To be perfectly honest, I don't
                        remember everything I said.  I just
                        know it was good.

                        Real good. If they had an Olympic
                        medal for lying, I'd have the gold
                        and the guys that won silver and
                        bronze would have shot themselves.

           We see the guys start to nod agreeably.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        If I was a superhero, my super power
                        would be lying.  "It's a bird, it's
                        a plane, no wait... it's whatever
                        the fuck I tell you it is." I was on
                        fire.
                            (beat)
                        All I know is, I would have said
                        anything in the world just get out
                        of that room and get the fuck away
                        from these guys.

           We see all of the guys smile at Mickey.  Yeah, he's that
           good.

                                                                  CUT TO

           INT. BASEMENT -- LATER

           Well, almost that good.  The room is dark and smoky.  Drinks
           and cards litter the table.  Mickey is sandwiched amongst a
           Mount Rushmore of muscle.  Everyone is drunk and happy...
           except Mickey...  Who is neither.

           Batman stands, pulls down his pants, and pushes his ass onto
           the table in front of Mickey.  His ass is riddled with scars. 
           The crew chortles and rolls.

                                 BATMAN
                        See that?  Fuckin' Skinhead in San
                        Pedro.  Three to five for armed
                        assault with intent to do bodily
                        harm.  Fuckin' redundant if you ask
                        me.  Anyway, this guy takes a contract
                        on me.  Gives it to this fuckin'
                        skinhead 'cause they'll work cheaper
                        than anyone else.  You know, white
                        man's burden.

           Batman thinks a moment.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, this guy that takes the
                        contract says, "Stab that motherfucker
                        right in the liver."  Day of, this
                        shit for brains little Hitler wannabe
                        goes to his cell mate, who's a real
                        wise-ass, and he goes, "hey, where's
                        the liver?"

                        And the cell mate goes,  I don't
                        know, I think it's in your ass
                        somewhere."  So this fuckin' mook
                        comes up and shivs my ass.  Nineteen
                        fuckin' times!

           They all laugh.  Mickey smiles nervously.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        That the prettiest lookin' liver you
                        ever seen or what?

                                 FETCH
                        Always takin' it in the ass, huh,
                        Jimmy?

           Batman doesn't think it's so funny but everyone else does. 
           Before Batman can make a thing of it, Little Heart Lou jumps
           up and nudges Batman into his seat.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                            (to Mickey)
                        Hey Kid, you know why they call me
                        Little Heart Lou?

           Mickey nods no.  Lou tears his shirt open exposing FOUR SCARS
           around his solar plexus.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU (CONT'D)
                        Four fuckin' bullets, right around
                        the heart.  Punctured a lung, cracked
                        two ribs
                            (shrugs no big deal)
                        Didn't touch the fuckin' ticker.
                            (beat)
                        Know who did that?

           Mickey nods.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU (CONT'D)
                        My fuckin' old lady.  While I'm trying
                        to explain to her how much her sister
                        looks just like her in the dark --
                        and the next thing you know
                            (indicates the scars)
                        An innocent mistake.

           Lou gets a little weepy as he admires the scars.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU (CONT'D)
                            (proud)
                        She love me or what?

           The crew pulls Lou back into this seat.

                                 BATMAN
                        Hey Mickey, show us some scars.
           All eyes on Mickey.

           Mickey sits stone still as sweat builds at an abnormal rate
           across his brow.

           ON THE CREW -- They all sit and wait.

           ON MICKEY -- UNCOMFORTABLE

           After an awkwardly long and uncomfortable silence, Mickey
           places his heel on the table and pulls up his pant leg
           revealing A SMALL HALF MOON SCAR.

                                 MICKEY
                        I, ah, got bit by a dog.

           The guys are all flat.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Twice.

           There is another agonizingly long silence.  Mickey swallows
           hard.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        I mean, same dog, but two bites.

           Batman bursts into uproarious laughter.  The rest of the
           crew follows suit.  Batman leans in and rubs Mickey's head.

                                 BATMAN
                        Fuckin' kid.  He's hilarious. 
                        Somebody pour him drink.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BASEMENT

           Stragglers, including Mickey, Brick, Batman, Little Heart
           Lou, and Fetch still work a card game.  Mickey can barely
           keep his eyes open.  On occasion the guys peek over their
           shoulders at him as they play.

           After a while they begin to talk about Mickey as if he weren't
           sitting right next to them.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                            (to Batman)
                        Go ahead.

                                 BATMAN
                        Why do I have to do it?

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                        C'mon, Jimmy.  Give it to the kid.

                                 BATMAN
                        Right fuckin' now?
                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                        Is there a better time?

                                 BATMAN
                        Ah, goddmanit.  Alright, alright,
                        I'll do it.

           Batman rises with a resigned look and crosses to Mickey.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Kid.  Get up.

           Mickey stirs.  Opens his eyes and sees Batman.  Batman smiles.

                                 MICKEY
                        Eh.

                                 BATMAN
                            (flat)
                        Come on.

                                 MICKEY
                        Okay.
                            (beat)
                        Where we going?

                                 BATMAN
                        You'll see.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT.  BACK ROOM -- A MINUTE LATER

           Mickey and Batman enter.  Even after Batman turns on the
           lights, it's still dark.

           Mickey is a little nervous throughout.

                                 MICKEY
                        What's up?

                                 BATMAN
                        It's a surprise, you'll see.
                            (points to corner)
                        Stand over there.

           Mickey looks to the corner where there is a PLASTIC TARP
           littered with paint cans.  Or is that held down by paint
           cans?

           Mickey gestures weakly and his voice cracks like an adolescent
           at prom.

                                 MICKEY
                        There?

                                 BATMAN
                        Yeah.
           Mickey is hesitant.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Come on, hurry up, I ain't got all
                        night.

           Mickey gingerly steps in the corner and onto the PLASTIC
           TARP.  As his face sinks...

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Okay, now turn around and close your
                        eyes.

           Mickey's eyebrows hit the ceiling.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Come on, let's not make this harder
                        than it has to be.

           Mickey stifles tears and fights to stay vertical as he follows
           orders.  A whimper escapes his lips as Batman busies himself
           looking for something in the near dark room.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Okay, no peeking.  Just give me a
                        sec, it's here somewhere.

           Batman bends over behind a stack of boxes.  A VIOLENT CLANKING
           AND RATTLING IS HEARD, then Batman pulls up a brand spanking
           new ALUMINUM LOUISVILLE SLUGGER.

           He walks over to Mickey who faces the wall and raises the
           bat over his shoulder.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        You ready?

           Mickey sighs.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Okay, turn around.

           Mickey turns around bracing for impact and jumps at the sight
           of Batman.

                        BATMAN (CONT'D)
                                                    MICKEY
                  (all smiles)
                                             Huh?
                Huh!

                                 BATMAN
                        Well, what do you think?

           Mickey hyper-ventilates.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        It's for you.
           He pushes the bat into Mickey's hands.  Batman is alarmed
           that Mickey isn't excited.

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        I didn't put a bow on it 'cause...
                        well, that's gay.  What do you think? 
                        Like it?

                                 MICKEY
                            (still in shock)
                        Ah, yeah.

                                 BATMAN
                        It's a Louisville Slugger, but it's
                        aluminum.  I like a classic as much
                        as anyone, but sometimes the wood
                        ones, they crack.  But aluminum,
                        there ain't a head on the planet
                        that can put a dent in aluminum. 
                        And ya soak it in a little bleach,
                        the DNA comes right off.  Good as
                        new.

           Batman's demeanor suddenly does an about face. 

                                 BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        We thought maybe you could use it on
                        the job 'cause... we need to make a
                        statement on this one.

                                 MCIKEY (V.O.)
                        Oh my god, I work for people who
                        makes statements with baseball bats... 
                        Something has gone terribly wrong
                        with my life.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Little Heart Lou has an arm slung over Mickey's shoulder and
           talks in a confidential tone as he leads him through the
           maze of hallways.

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                        Hey Mickey?

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah?

                                 LITTLE HEART LOU
                        You ain't gonna fuck this up, right?

           Mickey nods no.
                                 LITTLE HEART LOU (CONT'D)
                        'Cause sometimes the new guys, they
                        get green eyes... And if there's one
                        thing I've learned in my personal
                        experience, it's that when you are
                        given a responsibility or a job to
                        do and you don't do it professionally
                        and in a timely manner, it could get
                        you killed. And I don't just mean
                        kill killed.
                            (one breath)
                        I mean ass rape, boiled alive, chopped
                        into pieces in front of a mirror
                        under a picture of your grandma at
                        communion killed.
                            (beat)
                        Got it?

           Mickey nods as the blood drains from his face.  Just then
           Fetch comes up and throws and arm over Mickey's other shoulder
           and pulls him away from Lou.

                                 FETCH
                        You leaving Mickey?
                            (to Lou)
                        I'll take him out.

           Fetch flashes a big smile for Mickey.  Mickey isn't able to
           muster one back.

           EXT. STREGA RESTAURANT

           The sun hasn't even woken up yet as Mickey and Fetch walk to
           his car.  Fetch still has an arm over Mickey's shoulder and
           holds him close.

                                 FETCH
                            (rhetorical)
                        Was that fun, huh?

           Mickey nods yes while his expression calls him a liar.

                                 FETCH (CONT'D)
                        Takes one to know one, huh?

           Again Mickey nods.

                                 FETCH (CONT'D)
                        And I know you ain't one.

           It hangs in the air like... death.

                                 FETCH (CONT'D)
                        Let me explain something to you so
                        there is no misunderstanding about
                        the parameters of our relationship.

           Mickey nods.
                                 FETCH (CONT'D)
                        I hate you.  I hate your fucking
                        guts.  I don't care if The English
                        vouched for you.  You're a fraud. 
                        Saint Sinatra could come down from
                        heaven and suck your dick.  You're
                        still a fraud.
                            (beat)
                        I won't do anything to jeopardize
                        making my button, but the second I
                        do, I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

           Fetch opens the door to the hearse, puts Mickey behind the
           wheel, and slams the door shut.

           Mickey stares at Fetch through the window.  Fetch stares
           back.  Then knocks.  Mickey rolls down the window.  Fetch
           leans in.

                                 FETCH (CONT'D)
                        If I was you... I would still kill
                        you.
                            (beat)
                        But if that wasn't an option, I'd
                        buy a toothbrush and then go find a
                        nice little hut in the Himalayas to
                        live in for the rest of my life...
                        immediately.

           As Fetch pantomimes shooting Mickey in the head with his
           finger, we

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. JO'S BEDROOM

           Mickey and Jo.  Mickey's tone and pace couldn't be more
           frantic as he pulls bags out of Jo's closet and throws them
           onto the bed.  Jo's tone and pace couldn't be more
           lackadaisical as she reclines on the bed and watches.

                                 MICKEY
                        Throw some shit in a bag.  We gotta
                        get out of here.

                                 JO
                        What is wrong with you?

                                 MICKEY
                        We're leaving town.  Right now.

           Jo's jaw drops as she gets a lightning bolt realization.

                                 JO
                        Holy shit.  You mean...

           Mickey nods emphatically.
                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        We're going on vacation!

           Mickey goes blank.  Jo screams with elation and bounces on
           the bed.  Mickey grabs another bag from her closet.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Where are we going?

                                 MICKEY
                            (desperate)
                        Anywhere you want, baby.

                                 JO
                            (re: bags)
                        Not that one.  These...

           Jo produces A BRAND NEW LOUIS VUITTON LEATHER LUGGAGE SET
           then goes back to bouncing as Mickey tears the tags off the
           bags and begins frantically packing them.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                            (re: vacation)
                        Somewhere warm!

                                 MICKEY
                        As far as the money will take us.

           Jo's excitement suddenly deflates.

                                 JO
                        The money?

                                 MICKEY
                            (still packing)
                        Yeah.

           Jo's face twists into a knot of consternation.

                                 JO
                        What money?

           Mickey's dial is in the red.  His packing becomes more frantic
           with each tick of the clock.

                                 MICKEY
                        Whatever we got left.

                                 JO
                        You mean the money you left here?

           Mickey nods but doesn't lose a beat.  Jo slaps on an "oops
           face."

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I thought that money was for me.

           Mickey suddenly stops and his world begins to tilt.
                                 MICKEY
                        Oh my god.

           Mickey suddenly notices that he is packing nine thousand
           dollars of designer luggage.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god.

           We PAN WITH MICKEY as he looks around the room and notices
           for the first time that it is choke full of DESIGNER SHOPPING
           BAGS.

           Mickey starts to hyper-ventilate.  It's official, his world
           is turning upside down (along with the camera).  Mickey swoons
           and the POV blurs until WE FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN ON:

           EXT. SIDEWALK

           Mickey glides down the street in a daze, completely catatonic,
           with the baseball bat over his shoulder.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Somehow, things have gone horribly
                        wrong.  Suddenly, I was working for
                        guys that felt like the only thing
                        worse than killing someone for money,
                        was NOT killing someone for money.

           Mickey looks at the baseball bat as if it just showed up
           uninvited.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Sooner or later, everyone dies. 
                        Maybe even me.  That's the thing
                        about death, it isn't right or wrong,
                        it just is.  And it's everywhere.  I
                        mean if you just look around you,
                        you can see that.  Every minute of
                        every day somebody's killing someone
                        else...

           A SERIES OF SHOTS AS MICKEY TALKS IN V.O.

           An EXASPERATED PARENT chastises their adorable little child.

                                 EXASPERATED PARENT
                        You're killing me, you know that?

                        Sometimes it's an accident...

           The exasperated parent steps into the street still looking
           at their child and gets hit by a bus.  WHAM!!!
           INT. BUS

           The bus driver reacts with shock, slams the brakes, and comes
           to a screeching halt.  Within a fraction of a second a LOUD
           HORN BLARES.  As the bus driver startles:

           EXT. BUS

           We see that the bus is stopped over train tracks and - WHAM -
           IS SLAMMED BY A SPEEDING TRAIN.

                        And sometimes it's on purpose...

           We cut to a GUY SMOKING A CIGARETTE.

                        Like big tobacco...

           We cut to A FAT GUY with a big hard belly chomping a fast
           food burger.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Or Big Mac.  But really, no matter
                        how many ways people die, there are
                        only two kinds of deaths: those that
                        are a waste...

           FLASHBACK to the parent getting hit by the bus and the bus
           getting hit by the train.

                        And those that people benefit from...

           FLASHBACK to the guy smoking the cigarette and the fat guy
           chomping the burger... before cutting to:

           As a self-satisfied executive leans back in his decadent
           chair with a smug grin.

           Back with Mickey on sidewalk.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        I didn't want to kill anybody, but
                        if I didn't kill someone there would
                        be another wasted death... mine.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           DAYDREAM SEQUENCE

           Pig, Pepper, Brick, Tiny, and Little Heart Lou stand with
           their guns drawn on Mickey.  THEY FIRE.  Mickey goes down.
           WE HOLD FRAME as the guys adjust their aim down (on Mickey)
           and continue to fire.  Bang, Bang, pop, pop, bang, bang,
           pop, pop, pop -- until all of the guns click empty.

           The guys stare down at their handiwork a moment, then turn
           to Lou.  Lou nods.  They all drawn A SECOND GUN from their
           waists and fire into the same spot.  Bang, bang, pop, pop...
           until the guns click empty.  Again they all admire their
           work a moment and then look to Lou.  Lou nods and Batman
           comes charging forward with a bat raised over his head and
           proceeds to pummel whatever is left of Mickey below frame.

           As Batman pounds away, the rest of the guys watch and smile
           with the satisfaction of a job well done.

           END SEQUENCE

           EXT. SIDEWALK

           Mickey cringes at the thought and clutches his head.

                                 MICKEY
                        Shit.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I just needed time to figure this
                        out.  Just needed to go someplace
                        where I could think and gather my
                        thoughts.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. PINK LEOPARD LOUNGE

           Dark and dingy, just like a good strip club should be.  An
           ecdysiast entertains Mickey with preternaturally swollen
           boobs and oiled buttocks throughout.  Mickey is totally
           indifferent as he wrestles with his thoughts.  The less
           interested Mickey seems, the harder the young girl works.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Okay, so I had to kill a guy.  Yeah,
                        it sucked because I already had a
                        tons of other things to do today and
                        because...
                            (to himself)
                        I'm not a killer.

                        But what choice did I have?  It was
                        him or me.  Besides, if you think
                        about it, isn't killing someone the
                        ultimate self-affirmation.  It's
                        making a choice, a real choice, not
                        just a whether or not to super-size
                        it choice, but the kind of important
                        all or nothing choices we spend the
                        majority of our lives trying to avoid --

                        like the plague.  When you make a
                        choice like that, that your life is
                        important, the most important thing,
                        it's the ultimate actualization.

                        So what someone has to die for you
                        to do it.  People die all of the
                        time, right?  They have to, it's the
                        way the world works.  Mother Nature
                        needs it, demands it: plague, flood,
                        tsunami, piano wire, whatever.  And,
                        just between you and me, if we're
                        really honest about it, ninety-six
                        percent of people suck, so why not
                        kill a few.  It's not like I was
                        gonna whack Oprah.

                        Do what?

           Mickey and Goo Goo sit over plates of double cheese burgers
           and fries.  Once again, Mickey's plate is untouched and Goo
           Goo munches happily throughout.

                        I'm just asking if you'll help me.

                        Yeah, but what do you mean kill a
                        guy?

           Mickey nervously looks over both shoulders as his exasperation
           rockets to the moon.
                                 MICKEY
                        Goo, what else could that mean?

           Goo Goo nods with a knowing look.

                        That kid that tongue kissed you in

           Mickey is beside himself.

                                 MICKEY
                        No!  That's not what I'm talking
                        about -- and for the record, he didn't
                        tongue kiss me!  That's an urban
                        legend.

                                 GOO GOO
                        Mickey, I was there.

                                 MICKEY
                        There was no tongue!  And he hasn't
                        called me in at least two years. 
                        Are you gonna help me or not?

                        Just a guy.

           Goo Goo suddenly puts down his burger and furrows his brow.

                                 GOO GOO
                        What'd he do to you?

                        a friend to help me out.  If I didn't
                        really need this favor, I wouldn't

                        Not everybody.

           Mickey points out the window.

                        You're telling me if a guy scratched

                                 GOO GOO
                        That's different.  That's somebody

                        But if you haven't fucked with me,
                        what's the point?

           Mickey and Jo are tangled beneath the sheets.  Jo looks
           completely content.  Mickey looks just miserable.  Mickey
           gets out of bed and slips on pants.

                                 JO
                        What's wrong, baby?

                        You don't need your pants for that.

           INT. BATHROOM

           Mickey digs around a medicine cabinet perusing prescriptions. 
           He pops a lid and pops some pills.

                                 JO (O.S.)
                        Hey, what are you doing in there?

           Mickey reaches over and flushes the toilet.
                                 MICKEY
                            (calling out)
                        What?

                        Hurry up, I'm still horny.

           Mickey suddenly double takes on a prescription bottle, then
           winces.

           ECU -- PRESCRIPTION LABEL

           It reads: Rick Peretz.

                        Who the fuck is Rick Peretz?

           Mickey dumps half of the pills into his hand and stuffs them
           in his pocket before returning the bottle to the cabinet.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Back under the sheets.  Jo scribbles on Mickey's chest with
           her fingernails.

                                 JO
                        Oh.  That was here when I moved in.

                                 MICKEY
                        Jo, you've lived here over six years.

           Jo shrugs.

                        I want to come, Mickey.

                                 JO
                        I don't mean that.

                        I want to come.  With you.

           She can see that Mickey doesn't get it.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Like, come watch you work.

           Mickey grimaces.

                                 MICKEY
                        That's not a good idea.

                            (getting excited)
                        I feel like I don't know you.  I
                        want to know you.

                                 MICKEY
                        You know me.

                                 JO
                        No, I don't.  This whole time you've
                        been pretending to be this wimp. 
                        You know I usually I like those
                        Neanderthal type guys -- the bend
                        you over, pull your hair, take you
                        over the toilet type of guys, but
                        the way you ate pussy, just like a
                        girl, I thought shit, maybe I could
                        make this work.  But it hasn't been
                        easy.
                            (more excited)
                        But really, all this time, whenever
                        we made love, at any moment you
                        could've reached down and choked the
                        life out of me.

           Jo is beside herself with sexual energy.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I want to see you work.  I want to
                        see you be a man, Mickey.

                        Look, I know what you're thinking. 
                        I love Jo, but there was no way I
                        was gonna let her watch me kill a
                        guy.  Especially my first time.

                        Yeah, okay, I know.  But when you
                        get right down to it, there are only
                        two types of people in this world:
                        those that would kill for their
                        girlfriends and those that wouldn't.

                                 JO
                        How are we gonna do it?

                        behind him and yell boo, right?

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        There was an idea.

                                 JO
                        Shoot him?

                        Why not?

           Jo stares with expectation.  Mickey struggles a moment then
           makes it up as he goes along.

                                 MICKEY
                        We need to make a statement on this
                        one.

           Jo gets visibly excited.

                                 JO
                        How do we do that?

           Jo turns in her seat satisfied for a moment -- but only a

                        How do we get rid of it?

                                 MICKEY
                        Get rid of it?

                                 JO
                        Yeah.  You know, dispose of the body.

                        Behind every great man...

           Mickey thinks hard a moment, then makes a violent turn.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Hold on.

           Paint section.  Mickey holds a basket in one hand and studies
           a roll of plastic with the other.  He throws the roll in the
           basket, starts off, reconsiders, doubles back and grabs
           another roll just as a sales associate passes.

                                 MICKEY
                        Yo.

           The associate stops.

           EXT. HARDWARE STORE

           Mickey comes out of the hardware store and runs up to Jo's
           window empty-handed.  She rolls down the window.

                                 JO
                        What?
                                 MICKEY
                            (sheepish)
                        I don't have enough money.  What do
                        you have on you?

                                 JO
                        Nothing.

                                 MICKEY
                        Then let me borrow your debit card.

           Jo is unhappy with the idea, but after thinking about it for
           a couple of seconds... is even more unhappy with it.

                                 JO
                        My debit card?

                                 MICKEY
                        Come on, everyone's in line waiting
                        on me.

                                 JO
                        I don't want a record of this with
                        my name on it.

           Oh yeah.  Mickey's face flushes with frustration.

                                 MICKEY
                        Fuck.

           He looks over his shoulder at the hardware store, then runs
           around to the driver's side of the car and hops in.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT.  HEARSE

           Mickey and Jo sit in silence.  Both stare out the window
           hypnotized by...

           EXT. BUSTAMANTE RESIDENCE

           A nice house at the end of a quiet cul de sac in the type of
           neighborhood were long driveways and tall hedges keep your
           neighbors out of your business.

           INT. HEARSE

           They both look a little nauseous.  After a good long while...

                                 JO
                        Now what?

           Mickey considers.

                                 MICKEY
                        Wait here.
           EXT. HEARSE

           Mickey draws the baseball bat from the back.  Nausea arm-
           wrestles trepidation as Mickey wills his legs forward with
           increasingly uncertain steps.  As he passes Jo's window he
           taps on it.

           Jo rolls down the window.  She stares at Mickey with
           anticipation.  Mickey stares right back at a loss.  Then:

                                 MICKEY
                        I want you to know, baby, that all
                        of this, is for us.

           Jo looks at him with deep and tender eyes...

                                 JO
                        I know.

           Mickey turns, takes a step, stops suddenly, turns back.

                                 MICKEY
                        I love you, baby.

                                 JO
                        I know.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BUSTAMANTE RESIDENCE

           Mickey creeps around the house awkwardly maneuvering through
           and around hedges to peek into windows.  Mickey then
           disappears around the back of the house.

           INT. HEARSE

           Insanely tense, Jo watches and waits a good long time before
           Mickey reappears from around the other side of the house. 
           Mickey looks to Jo and shrugs his shoulders.

           EXT. HEARSE

           Mickey leans into Jo's open window.

                                 MICKEY
                        Nobody's home.

                                 JO
                        Are you sure?

                                 MICKEY
                        I didn't see anybody.

                                 JO
                        Well, why don't you go knock on the
                        door?
                                 MICKEY
                        You can't just go knock on the door
                        when you're coming over to kill
                        somebody.

                                 JO
                        Why not?  Just whack him when he
                        answers.  Isn't that what it's called? 
                        Whacking?

                                 MICKEY
                        You can't.

                                 JO
                        Why not?

                                 MICKEY
                        It's just not done.  It's like a
                        rule.

                                 JO
                        Well, it's a stupid rule.
                            (beat)
                        Now what?

                                 MICKEY
                        I don't know.  Try later, I guess.

                                 JO
                        I thought you said it had to be done
                        tonight?

                                 MICKEY
                        It does.  But if he's not here, what
                        are we gonna --

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What the fuck are you doing in my
                        driveway?

           Mickey jumps and yelps like a manhandled hampster.  And there,
           standing over them like some sort of human eclipse, is VINNIE
           "THE NECK" BUSTAMANTE, built like a bulldozer with the face
           of a bulldog.  Vinnie wears a leather jacket over a bathrobe
           which exposes his naked legs and slippered feet.

           Mickey is obviously scared and terribly distracted by the
           huge scar that runs from one side of Vinnie's neck to the
           other.  Words fail him as he continually nods no in reply.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        I said, what the fuck are you doing
                        here?

           Mickey has to fight through his panic and fear to form the
           words.
                                 MICKEY
                        We're lost.

                                 JO
                        No!

           Vinnie shoots Jo a "What the fuck" look.  So does Mickey. 
           And what Mickey sees, he doesn't like.  Jo is amped.  Just
           as Vinnie notices Mickey is holding a baseball bat:

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Come on, Mickey, kill him.

           Mickey's mouth falls to the ground.  As he turns and tries
           to explain, Vinnie grabs his neck with rattle snake reflexes
           and two of the biggest hands this side of a theme park.

           Mickey squawks hoarsely as he struggles to break Vinnie's
           grip.  If ever there was an effort in vain.

           Vinnie shakes the life out of Mickey until...

           Aiiieeehhya!  Jo wails as she takes a wild swings and
           TWHWACK!!! whacks Vinnie in the face with A SHOE.

           Vinnie cries out and clutches his face and the shoe that is
           now stuck to it.  As he staggers aimlessly clutching his
           face with one hand and clawing at the air with the other:

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        Ahhhhhh!  Motherfuck.  My eye.

           Mickey picks himself up and jumps in the car with Jo.

           INT. HEARSE

           As Mickey reaches for the ignition with the keys -- Jo grabs
           his wrist.  Vinnie wails in the B.G. throughout.

                                 JO
                        Aren't you going to finish him?

                                 MICKEY
                        This isn't really working out the
                        way it was supposed to.  I think we
                        should go.

                                 JO
                        Mickey!  He's got my brand new
                        Louboutin!  Go get my fucking shoe!

           EXT. BUSTAMANTE RESIDENCE

           Vinnie staggers back into his house.  Mickey follows him.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BUSTAMANTE RESIDENCE

           Vinnie stumbles around helplessly.  Mickey follows him around
           the house "at a safe distance." Somehow Vinnie manages to be
           completely pathetic and totally abusive at the same time.

                                 MICKEY
                        I am so sorry.  There was a little
                        bit of a misunderstanding.  My
                        girlfriend thought --

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        A misunderstanding?  I have a fucking
                        shoe in my eye.

                                 MICKEY
                        I said I'm sorry.  I'll help you
                        pull it out.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        Pull it out?  It's attached to my
                        fucking eyeball.  Owww!  Goddammit.

           Mickey is becoming more and more flustered.

                                 MICKEY
                        Then let me take you to the hospital.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                            (desperate)
                        I'm self-employed, I don't have
                        insurance.

           Mickey is about to pass out.

                                 MICKEY
                        I'll pay for it!

           Vinnie has to crane his neck past 180 degrees to look at
           Mickey with his one good eye.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BUSTAMANTE RESIDENCE

           Vinnie has one of his huge arms slung over Mickey's shoulder
           as Mickey leads him toward the car.  Jo sees this from the
           distance and stiffens.

                                 MICKEY
                            (to Vinnie)
                        We're almost there.

           We hear the tires spin on the gravel of the driveway.  Mickey
           looks up just as Jo is about to run them over.
           INT. HEARSE

                                 JO
                        I'm coming baby.

           Mickey reflexively jumps.

           Thunk, thump, thump.  Jo hits Vinnie with the car, tosses
           him across the drive and then slides over him as she slams
           the barkes and slides to a stop.

           EXT. HEARSE

                                 MICKEY
                        Oh god.

           Vinnie's body is stuck under the car.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        OHHHHHH MY GOD!  Get it off me, get
                        it off me.

           Mickey rushes to Vinnie.

                                 MICKEY
                        Uhhhhhh --

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        Get it off me!

                                 MICKEY
                        Okay, don't move.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        Don't move?  I'm under a car, you
                        asshole!

                                 MICKEY
                        Just relax!

           Mickey pulls Jo out from behind the wheel.

                                 JO
                            (confused)
                        What the fuck, Mickey?  Did you get
                        my shoe?

           INT. HEARSE

           Mickey puts the car in gear and tries to slowly roll off
           Vinnie.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK (O.S.)
                        Owwwwww!!!!  Owwwww!!!!  Owwwww!!!!

                                 MICKEY
                        Shit!
           Mickey stops the car and hops out.

           EXT. HEARSE

           Now Vinnie is trapped under the car at a weird angle.  Mickey
           squats and grabs him under his arms.

                                 MICKEY
                        Okay, I'm just gonna slide you out.

           As Mickey pulls:

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        Owwww, owwww, owwwww.  Wait, wait,
                        wait!

           Mickey stops.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK (CONT'D)
                        The shoe's stuck on something.

           As Mickey steps around to unhinge the backstrap from the
           fender Jo comes around the corner swinging and pounds Vinnie
           with the baseball bat.  Vinnie screams (of course).  Mickey
           jumps up and stops her.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ!

                                 MICKEY
                        Jo, what the fuck are you doing?

                                 JO
                        Making a statement.

                                 MICKEY
                        Jo, we're not killing him!

                                 JO
                        What?  Why not?

                                 MICKEY
                        Because.  This is not how you do it?

                                 JO
                            (defensive)
                        Are you saying that because I'm here? 
                        You think I can't handle this?  Well,
                        fuck you, Mickey.  And you too.

           She takes advantage of the bat's extended reach to whack
           Vinnie.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        Goddammit!  Tell that crazy bitch
                        I'm gonna shoot her.

           Jo shoots Mickey a look, "see," and points at Vinnie.
                                 JO
                        On general principle.

                                 MICKEY
                        Just wait in the car.

                                 JO
                        Are you serious?

                                 MICKEY
                            (screams)
                        You are fucking this up!  Wait in
                        the car.

           She should be pissed, but she loves it.  Jo's demeanor shifts
           180 degrees.  Suddenly warm as California sunshine.

                                 JO
                        Okay, baby.
                            (gives him a peck)
                        I'm Sorry.  I'm gonna wait in the
                        car.

           Mickey turns back to Vinnie.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        Awwww, goddammit!

                                 MICKEY
                            (startled)
                        What?

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        I think I shit myself.

           Mickey leans in to pull Vinnie out.

                                 MICKEY
                        Don't worry about that right --
                            (head snaps back)
                        Oh yeah, you did!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HEARSE -- DRIVING - MORNING

           Mickey and Jo drive in the front.  Vinnie is slumped in the
           back.

                                 JO
                        Why the fuck are we taking him to
                        the hospital?

                                 MICKEY
                        I said, I'll explain it later.
                                 JO
                        And what's that smell?  Is that what
                        dead people smell like?

                                 MICKEY
                        He's not dead, he just --

           Vinnie's limp body slumps forward and smacks between the
           seats.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Fuck.

                                 JO
                        Mickey...

                                 MICKEY
                        What?

                                 JO
                        I have to pee.

                                 MICKEY
                        Right now?

           Jo nods yes.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        It can't wait?

           Jo nods no.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        We'll be at the hospital in ten
                        minutes --

                                 JO
                        Mickey, why are we gonna take a dead
                        guy to the hospital?

           Mickey thinks about it.

                                 MICKEY
                        Fuck.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ROADSIDE REST STOP

           Ubiquitous interstate rest stop.  Desolate at this hour except
           for the hearse.

           INT. HEARSE

           Mickey waits in the car impatiently.  In mere seconds he
           checks the clock a half dozen times and looks even more
           worried than he was seconds ago.
           EXT. HEARSE

           Mickey exits the car and crosses to the ladies room.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LADIES ROOM ROADSIDE REST STOP

           It was probably clean once.

                                 MICKEY (O.S.)
                        Jo?

           Mickey comes around the corner cautiously.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (softly)
                        Jo?

           He listens for a response and creeps forward peeking into
           the stalls.  He sees a door ajar and peeks inside.

           MICKEY'S POV -

           Jo sits on the floor of the stall with her head hanging over
           the toilet.  It is obvious that she has been sick.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        You okay?

           She looks up at Mickey and we see something we've never seen
           from Jo before: vulnerability.

                                 JO
                        It seems like a lot more fun on TV.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HEARSE -- DRIVING

           Mickey and Jo drive along a dark road in silence.  Jo is
           snuggled up to his shoulder and fast asleep.  It is a fragile
           moment we haven't yet seen between them.  In fact, it would
           be downright romantic if it weren't for the body with a shoe
           in one of its eyes slumped across the back seat.

           EXT. JO'S HOUSE

           The hearse pulls up.

           INT. HEARSE

           Jo is still snuggled into Mickey's shoulder.  He gently rubs
           her shoulder to wake her.

                                 MICKEY
                            (whispers)
                        Jo, Sweetie... you're home.
           Jo looks up all sleepy and vulnerable.  She looks at Mickey
           adoringly and reaches up and gently strokes his cheek.

                                 JO
                        I love you, Mickey.

           Mickey feels the words all over his body.  Now we get it. 
           Get them.

                                 MICKEY
                        I love you, babe.

           She kisses him.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Get some rest.  I'll be back in a
                        little bit.

           With a knowing and loving smile:

                                 JO
                        Okay.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. FUNERAL HOME PARKING LOT

           The hearse slowly backs up to the back door of the funeral
           home.  Mickey hops out, stares anxiously at Vinnie's body
           through the window, then fumbles with a big set of keys at
           the door.

           INT. FUNERAL HOME

           Mickey steps into PITCH BLACK.  We hear him knock about for
           a bit, then some lights flicker on in the back of the room. 
           Mickey continues to tinker with the switches but can't find
           anymore illumination so the lighting remains low key and
           haunting throughout.

           Mickey makes his way to the cremator furnace.  As he studies
           the computer beside the door we can tell that he is completely
           unfamiliar with the system.

                                 MICKEY
                            (searching with his
                             finger)
                        On, on, on, on...

           He pushes a big red button.  We hear a whooshing sound and a
           big rumble.  The temperature starts to climb on a digital
           readout.

           Mickey crosses to the charger (motorized trolley belt) and
           suddenly double-takes on something... there on the belt is a
           serving tray with A BOTTLE AND TWO GLASSES ON IT.  Mickey
           looks closer in the dark and sees there is also a TUBE OF
           LIPSTICK.
           Mickey anxiously looks over both shoulders and decides to
           have a peek around.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (sotto voce)
                        Louis?

           And just then, the tarp on the prep table Mickey is passing
           moves!  Mickey reflexively flips -- rocketing back across
           the room swearing through an intense involuntary fear reflex.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (breathless)
                        Fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck...

           Mickey is halfway across the room and has knocked everything
           in his path over before he notices....  Louis sitting up on
           the table.  Louis looks worried.

                                 LOUIS
                        Hey, Mickey.  What's going on?  Hope
                        I didn't startle you.

           Mickey can't even pretend.

                                 MICKEY
                        Jesus Christ.  You scared the shit
                        out of me, Louis.

           As he climbs down off the table:

                                 LOUIS
                        Pete hasn't been around and I've
                        been working late, so sometimes I
                        just --
                            (beat)
                        You haven't seen Pete around have
                        you?

           Mickey is slow to nod no.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, he does that sometimes.  Just
                        disappears.  But he always comes
                        back.  And don't worry, anything he
                        owes you, he'll pay you back.
                            (beat)
                        Did you, ah, turn on the furnace?

           Mickey is slow to nod yes.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        Why?

           It takes him a second to build up some steam and find an
           answer but once he does.
                                 MICKEY
                        Look Louis, I don't know what
                        happened.  I just, I just wanted a
                        job, so I could be like everybody
                        else for once.  Reliable and
                        predictable.  For my girlfriend. 
                        And I wasn't going to kill him, I
                        swear, I was just there because --
                        once things got going I didn't know
                        how to stop it, it was like this big
                        wave and, I wasn't going to, but
                        once I got there, and I didn't want
                        to disappoint my girlfriend, she
                        gets upset real easy, and sometimes
                        she gets a little worked-up and then
                        the guy just --

           Something catches Mickey's eye and his words freeze in his
           throat leaving his mouth open and empty.

           On the table Louis was sleeping on... there is a woman lying
           on her side with her back to us.  Not just any woman, but a
           woman with post mortem autopsy sutures across her back.

           Unable to look Mickey in the eye or muster words, Louis just
           drops his head and nods his denial.

           It takes Mickey a moment to catch his breath.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        I got a body in the car, Louis.  I
                        need to burn it.

           Louis looks up at Mickey and studies him with great
           intensity...

                                 LOUIS
                        Okay. You need help getting it in?

           Mickey nods.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        I just gotta grab some pants.

           Mickey doesn't know what to say. He turns to leave.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        Mickey...

           Mickey turns back.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        I don't know if you've figured
                        everything out around here yet, but
                        there are a lot of secrets.  We keep
                        each others secrets.  That's what we
                        do.  So whatever you're into, just
                        know, there's no judgment.
           Mickey can't muster a response.  He turns and makes for the
           door.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        And Mickey...

           He turns back.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        Just for the record, so you know. 
                            (indicating corpse)
                        We were just spooning.

           Mickey stares on in horror.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        I just wouldn't want you to think
                        anything weird was going on.

           And leaves.

           EXT. FUNERAL HOME

           Mickey has the rear doors to the hearse open.  He stares in
           at Vinnie's body... and Jo's Louboutin.  He struggles with a
           thought, then looks over his shoulder for Louis.

                                 MICKEY
                            (to himself)
                        Jesus Christ.

           He grabs Vinnie by the ankles and slowly drags the body across
           the seat and out of the car.  THA-THUNK!  Vinnie's  body
           slams to the asphalt with an inelegant thud and his coat and
           robe fall wide open for the first time revealing that...
           Vinnie is buck naked underneath.

           Mickey is dumbfounded and grossed out.  He kneels over the
           head and fights nausea as he tries to figure out how to
           delicately remove the shoes from Vinnie's eye socket.  He
           keeps repositioning his grip and posture, but nothing feels
           right.  Exasperated he grabs the shoe and takes a deep breath.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (to himself)
                        One,
                            (deep breath)
                        Two,
                            (deeper breath)
                        Three

           And as Mickey YANKS, VINNIE SHOOTS UP FLAILING AND WAILING. 
           The only thing on this planet louder than Vinnie's scream,
           is Mickey's.

           Mickey goes over.  Vinnie jumps up and starts running.  And
           screaming.  And running.  And screaming.
                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Shit!

           Mickey jumps up and gives chase.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                            (calling)
                        Wait, wait, wait...
                            (to himself)
                        Shit, shit, shit...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ROADSIDE

           Half-naked, bloody and sweaty with a shoe in his eye, Vinnie
           is already up and running along the side of a thoroughfare
           with headlights flashing across the spectacle that he's become
           by the time Mickey catches up.

                                 MICKEY
                        Vinnie, wait!  Jesus Christ, just
                        stop.

           Winded Vinnie slows and turns to face Mickey.  As Mickey
           approaches, Vinnie backs up to keep a safe distance.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        Stay way from me.

                                 MICKEY
                        I'm sorry.

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        What'd I ever do to you?  I don't
                        even fucking know you.

                                 MICKEY
                        No, you don't understand.  It's not
                        personal, I was hired to kill you --

                                 VINNIE THE NECK
                        Kill me?  So you put a shoe in my
                        eye, run me over, and hit me with a
                        baseball bat?  That's not how you
                        kill people, you sick fuck.

                                 MICKEY
                        I don't want to kill you and I don't
                        want you to die, I just --

           Mickey hasn't even finished his sentence as Vinnie unknowingly
           steps backwards into the road

           WHAM!  Vinnie is slammed by a car and throw into the air and
           across the road.
           Mickey reflexively cringes and clutches his head like, well
           like he just saw some get hit by a car.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Oh god.

           Mickey looks genuinely stricken staring at Vinnie's lump of
           a lifeless body... until that lump moves.  Mickey flushes
           with relief.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Oh, thank god.

           But that relief is short lived as Vinnie is smacked by a car
           coming from the other direction.  WHAM!

           Mickey has to turn away from the ghastly sight.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FUNERAL HOME PARKING LOT

           Louis stands next to the hearse as Mickey approaches from
           the far end of the lot.  Mickey is completely catatonic.

                                 LOUIS
                        Hey, where'd you go?

           Mickey can't answer.  Doesn't even try.  As he closes the
           doors.

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        You still need help with the --

           Mickey nods no and climbs behind the wheel.  As he pulls
           off... Louis waves goodbye.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DINER

           Mickey and Goo.  Once again, Goo Goo stuffs his face
           throughout.

                                 GOO GOO
                        Mexico?

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah, why not?  It's cheap.  They
                        got lots of beaches.  And Mexican
                        girls.

           Goo Goo considers, then

                                 GOO GOO
                        I don't know, man.  It can't be that
                        great.  Everybody down there wants
                        to come here.
                                 MICKEY
                        Fuck it, then we'll go to Bolivia. 
                        Like Butch and Sundance.

                                 GOO GOO
                        What's Jo gonna do?

                                 MICKEY
                        She's coming?

                                 GOO GOO
                            (skeptical)
                        You ask her yet?

                                 MICKEY
                        No, but I'm going there right now.

                                 GOO GOO
                        She'll never go for it.

                                 MICKEY
                        Things are different now.  She'll
                        say yes.

           Goo Goo considers again.

                                 GOO GOO
                        I don't know, man.  Shits finally
                        coming together for me.  Getting my
                        life straightened out.  Finally got
                        something I can call my own.  I got
                        a good gig with some med students
                        over at Saint Elizabeth's writing
                        'scrips for me.
                            (suddenly excited,
                             proud)
                        Mickey, you wouldn't believe it! 
                        It's fucking amazing, man.  These
                        kids are so broke, they're practically
                        giving it away.  Rolling all those
                        drugstores and nursing homes.  You
                        were right, man, that was nowhere. 
                        Total Bullshit.  But this, this is
                        cake.

           Goo Goo pulls a prescription bottle out of his pocket, pours
           some pills into his hands and proffers it to Mickey.  Mickey
           accepts.

           Goo Goo slaps the bottle down in front of Mickey, pops the
           in his hand, and chases them with a big swallow of soda. 
           Mickey follows suit.

                                 GOO GOO (CONT'D)
                        No more dry times, brother.  I got
                        so much I'm even selling.
                                 (MORE)
                                 GOO GOO (CONT'D)
                        I got more money and pussy than I
                        know what to do with.  There ain't a
                        chick in Montbridge County that won't
                        fuck you real hard, like hard enough
                        to hurt your feelings, for a handful
                        of oxyies.

           As Mickey puts down his glass, he knocks over the pill bottle
           which he quickly rights.  As Goo Goo continues to ramble in 
           the B.G. Mickey double takes on the bottle and squints at
           the label.

           ECU - PRESCRIPTION LABEL

           Across the top of the prescription is the name: RICK PERETZ

                                 MICKEY
                            (to himself)
                        Rick Peretz...

           Goo Goo perks up and jumps in --

                                 GOO GOO
                        Oh yeah.  That's one of my
                        prescription aliases.
                            (does quote fingers)
                        Rick, lives in Cherrry Hill.  No
                        one's going to question a 'scrip
                        from that address in that
                        neighborhood.
                            (chuckles)
                        Complete bullshit, man.  Rick don't
                        exist.  That's the beauty of it,
                        man.  No one can connect it to me.

           Mickey goes numb.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Except me.

                                 GOO GOO
                            (oblivious)
                        You can have em if you want.  Go on,
                        take em.

           Mickey stands like a somnambulist and staggers away.  Goo
           Goo continues to munch happily.  With his mouth still full:

                                 GOO GOO (CONT'D)
                        Um, hey, have a good time in Belize,
                        man.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. STREET

           Mickey is still breathless and numb from the blow to his
           soul.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        All this time I had never wanted to
                        kill anybody... until now.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT.  MICKEY'S BEDROOM

           Mickey recklessly stuffs clothes and myriad other belongings
           into an over-sized duffel bag.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        A big part of winning, is knowing
                        when to quit.

           INT. STAIRS

           Mickey starts down the stairs and suddenly stops.

           MICKEY'S POV - LOOKING DOWN INTO THE LIVING ROOM

           Mrs Kalligheri sits in her underwear splayed out on the couch
           in the dark room hypnotized by the TV with a drink in hand. 
           Mickey darts back up the stairs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MRS KALLIGHERI'S BEDROOM

           Mickey checks over his shoulder as he soft steps it into the
           bedroom.  He goes directly to his mother's nightstand, grabs
           three prescription bottles and empties half of each into his
           pockets.

           With an eye on the door, he quickly crosses to a chair and
           blades his hand beneath the cushion and retracts a purse. 
           He opens the purse, rummages and extracts a roll of cash. 
           He slides the roll into his pocket.

           INT. STAIRS

           Mickey hustles down with his duffel bag.

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           It is still dark and Mrs Kalligheri is still numbly splayed
           on the couch in front of the TV in her underwear.  With a
           drink in hand, she is the poster child for for a hard life
           and discontent.

           Mickey gives her a quick look as he makes his way out the
           door.  And then suddenly stops.  We see that he is somehow
           affected.  She doesn't even seem to notice Mickey is there.
           Mickey reaches down and touches the pocket he slipped the
           money into.  After a moment, he crosses to the adjacent love
           seat and sits.  Mrs Kalligheri is watching Scarface (although
           watching is a generous summation of her attention).

           They sit in silence a while, Mrs Kalligheri never giving any
           indication that she knows Mickey is there.  Finally, Mickey
           clears his throat.  Mrs Kalligheri blinks long and slow and
           looks at, or maybe through, Mickey for the first time.

           Mickey reaches into his pocket and places the wad of cash on
           the table.  There is another awkward silence.  Mickey clears
           his throat.  Mrs Kalligheri stares at Mickey blankly.

                                 MICKEY
                        Mom... I might be going away for
                        awhile.
                            (beat)
                        And I just wanted to...
                            (beat)
                        You know...

           Well, he tried anyway.  Mickey rises from the couch with a
           sad look on his face and heads to the door.  Mrs Kalligheri
           clears her throat.  Mickey stops and turns to her expectantly. 
           And then she clears it again.  And now she scrapes the back
           of her throat.  It is a fierce battle with phlegm.

           Finally, a big, rattling loogie comes up.  She lets it slide
           out between her lips into a dirty glass.  Mickey throws his
           bag back on his shoulder and heads for the door.

                                 MRS KALLIGHERI (O.S.)
                        Mickey...

           Mickey stops in the doorway and turns to his mother.  Mrs
           Kalligheri is looking at him for the first time.  Her
           expression is tender and pained.

                                 MRS KALLIGHERI (CONT'D)
                        When a child is born, the first time
                        a parent takes that child in their
                        arms and looks at them, that parent
                        can tell when the child is special
                        or gifted or meant for great things --
                        and not just because you're that
                        child's parent -- I'm talking about
                        something bigger than that.  About
                        what that child is going to do in
                        the world, for the world.  A parent
                        just knows these things.  And what
                        you hope as a parent is that you can
                        do enough for that child to help
                        nurture their gift, to help their
                        gift grow.

                                 MRS KALLIGHERI (CONT'D)
                        There's no worse feeling than seeing
                        that something special in a child
                        and feeling like maybe you didn't do
                        everything you could have so they
                        could realize that.

           Mickey has trouble speaking through the welling of emotion:

                                 MICKEY
                        I know things weren't always perfect,
                        but you tried your best with me.  I
                        don't blame you for --

           Cutting him off mid-sentence:

                                 MRS KALLIGHERI
                        Mickey --

                                 MICKEY
                        Huh.

                                 MRS KALLIGHERI
                        I was talking about your brother.
                            (beat)
                        You make sure you go visit him. 
                        Those big fellas are making a mess
                        of him in there.
                            (lamenting)
                        They just put that bitch stamp on
                        him day one.  It ain't never got
                        better...

           Mickey needs a moment to gather his demeanor.  He crosses to
           the door again, suddenly thinks better of it, walks over to
           his mother and with a soft, tender, and slightly forlorn
           look on his face... takes the money back.  And leaves.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT SIDEWALK

           Mickey exits the house and fishes for his keys as he hustles
           down the street.  It is only a matter of seconds before a
           car jumps the curb and comes to a screeching halt in front
           him.  Not just any car, a Cadillac.  Yeah that Cadillac. 
           With a big thick forearm hanging out of it.  Yeah, that
           forearm.

                                 PEPPER
                        Hey Mickey, you going somewhere?

           The back doors pop open and Brick and Tiny step out as we:

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. CADILLAC

           Mickey rides in the middle of the back seat squeezed
           uncomfortably between Brick and Tiny.  Mickey really couldn't
           be more uncomfortable, until...

           A familiar voice comes echoing from the front.

                                 FAMILIAR VOICE (O.S.)
                        Well, well, look what the cat drug
                        in.  "Curiouser and curiouser."

           English Pete leans around the seat and peeks into the back.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        "You can't think how glad I am to
                        see you again, you dear old thing."
                        It's good to see you again, Mickey. 
                        Didn't really get a proper good-bye
                        so we've got lots and lots of catching
                        up to do.

           Mickey doesn't respond.  Probably couldn't if he wanted to. 
           Pete shakes an admonishing finger at him.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        Naughty, naughty.

           Pete smiles warmly at Mickey before turning back in his seat. 
           A moment later he turns up the radio.  And as the most soulful
           music you've ever heard plays, we

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. WAREHOUSE

           ANGLE ON THE EMBER OF A CIGARETTE AS IT GLOWS BRIGHTLY.

           As we pull back, we see that the cigarette is in Mickey's
           mouth.

           After a moment, Pete steps forward on a cane and gingerly
           removes the cigarette from Mickey's mouth.  Pete hands the
           cigarette to Fetch with a look of disgust.  Fetch promptly
           carries the cigarette out of the room.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        I wasn't sure if Pete was more upset
                        about the money or the fact that he
                        blamed me for getting hit by that
                        car.  And shot.  A lot.

           As Pete fastens a briefcase and places it next to the table.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        They were paying him to kill me, so
                        it probably wasn't the money.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        There's probably some sort of social
                        stigma about being a Professional
                        hit man who gets hit.  Can't be good
                        for your reputation.  Either way, he
                        had a pretty good excuse for what he
                        was about to do to me.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Do you have any idea what I'm about
                        to do to you?

           Pete looks over each shoulder to assure privacy of proximity,
           then leans in confidentially:

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        I think you're about to hit a bit of
                        a rough patch, but the important
                        thing is to just "keep calm and carry
                        on."
                            (beat)
                        And of course, don't forget to
                        breathe, Mickey.  Just breathe.

           Pete takes an exemplary calming breath: in through the nose,
           out through the mouth.  As Mickey talks in V.O., the scene
           begins to slowly overlap with our opening...

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Okay, I know what you're thinking. 
                        But when was the last time you had
                        an adventure?

           Brick and Tiny step forward and fill the screen with their
           enormity.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I don't mean getting a reservation
                        at some super obnoxious restaurant
                        before your friends so you can brag
                        about how much you paid to get abused
                        and how you've had better.

           CLOSE ON BRICK'S FIST

           Just as Pete drops his weight into the down stroke

           BANG!  A gun shot rings out.

           And CRASH Pete misses Mickey's head and cracks the chair. 
           Pete straightens himself in the most dignified manner possible
           on his still wobbly legs, then turns and once again looks as
           if someone has just peed in his Cheerios.

           And there stands Fetch with a gun in hand.  Everyone looks
           confused.  Pete shakes an admonishing finger at Fetch.

                        I'm sure there's a perfectly good
                        reason you discharged a firearm just
                        as I was about to have...  A moment. 
                        So would you be so kind as to explain

                            (to lion)
                        You fucking cunt!

           Fetch couldn't be less concerned.

                                 FETCH
                        Sure.  One, I think you talk funny, 
                        I don't like the way you dress, and
                        I ain't never seen you talk about a
                        girl.  Ever.  Two, the oath I swore
                        as a detective means that as stupid
                        and ugly as I think this fucking kid
                        is, I ain't gonna let you kill him. 
                        And three, the wire I been wearing
                        the last three years is giving me a
                        rash.  How's that for a reason?

           Pete, Brick, and Tiny all exchange looks.  Mickey is most
           surprised of all.

                        Well, that leaves us in a bit of a
                        curious predicament.  There are three
                        of us and only one of you.

                        Yeah but I got enough bullets to
                        kill all of you twice.  So decide
                        amongst yourselves who wants to die
                        first...

           Again, all of the men exchange tense looks.

                        us spread out across the room like
                        we are, not one of us would have
                        time to draw and kill you?

                                 FETCH
                        Never been more sure of anything in
                        my life.

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Well, I guess that leaves us with
                        just one more question.

                                 FETCH
                        Yeah, what's that?

                                 ENGLISH PETE
                        Are you bullet proof?

           And on cue Brick, Tiny, and Pete draw on Fetch.  But Fetch
           is already firing.  It's World War Wow as bullets rip the
           air unrelentingly.

           ANGLE ON MICKEY

           tied to the chair with his eyes closed as bullets whiz by
           and shred the chair.  We watch as the chair literally
           splinters and inelegantly drops Mickey to the floor.  The
           gunfire stops just as abruptly as it started.

           All four men lay haphazardly in pools of blood.  There isn't
           so much as a moan amongst them.  Prognosis.  Bad.

           Mickey is in shock.  He has to survey the scene twice before
           it sinks in.  But it sinks in.  He jumps up and makes for
           the door... but face plants as he trips over something.

           As Mickey turns to untangle his legs, he sees that he has
           tripped over and knocked open the briefcase FULL OF MONEY.

           Mickey reflexively looks around the room again, then grabs
           the briefcase and hustles across the slippery floor.

           At the door.  Someone clears their throat.  Mickey turns. 
           It's Pete... looking up from a pool of blood.  He strains to
           speak.

                                 ENGLISH PETE (CONT'D)
                        Naughty... naughty.

           Mickey runs.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. STREET

           Mickey is in rough shape.  Battered, bruised, and bloody. 
           But he is running.  Fast.  And the damnedest thing about it. 
           He has a big smile on his face.  It's missing some teeth,
           but it's a big smile none-the-less.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        There are lots of problems in life. 
                        And most of them you can't fix.  But
                        there isn't a single problem you
                        can't run away from.

           After looking over his shoulders he begins to laugh.  Like a
           maniac.  You've never seen someone happier or more alive. 
           In fact, the only thing that could make this moment more
           sublimely happy is Peter Bjorn and John's irrepressibly upbeat
           anthem "Nothing to Worry About."  And sure enough there is
           it in the  B.G. with children melodically chanting "Nothing
           to Worry About" as Mickey races down the street beneath
           beautiful blue sky and sunshine with a briefcase full of
           money.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Turn off your TV, throw away your
                        cell phone, and burn your credit
                        cards because the new black... is
                        breathing.  That's the secret to
                        life.  It's living.  Because if you
                        hold on long enough, maybe your life
                        really will turn into a fairy tale. 
                        Maybe your Prince Charming, rich
                        widow, million dollar scratch ticket,
                        or mob embezzlement payday is
                        somewhere just around the corner.

           And as Mickey rounds the corner with a tooth-impaired Chesire
           Cat grin:

                                 MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It's funny how your luck can change
                        just like that!

           WHAM!!!

           Mickey is slammed by a car and thrown out of frame.  Over
           the sound of TIRES SQUEALING to a halt -- it begins to RAIN
           DOLLAR BILLS IN SLOW MOTION as we slowly

           FADE TO BLACK.

                                 THE END
