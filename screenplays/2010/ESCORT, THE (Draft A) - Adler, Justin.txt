           INT. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE - DAY

           A sold-out, crowded flight.  The CAMERA MOVES through the 
           cabin.  We can hear a MAN’S VOICE over the loud-speaker.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Flight-time to New York will be two 
                        hours, twenty-six minutes.  So sit 
                        back, relax, and enjoy our in-
                        flight hospitality...

           INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A very cramped airplane bathroom.  GARY DECKER, 30’s, good-
           looking, in a white airline uniform, is behind an 
           unattractive, CONSIDERABLY OVERWEIGHT FEMALE PASSENGER.  The 
           two are trying to have sex, but it’s difficult due to the 
           lack of space in the bathroom, and her size.

                                 OVERWEIGHT PASSENGER
                        Come on, Captain.  Bring her home.  

                                 DECKER
                        I’ve found the landing strip, I 
                        just need more thrust.

           Decker struggles to find even an inch to move.  There is an 
           IMPATIENT KNOCK on the other side of the door.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (calling through door)
                        Just a minute!  
                             (to overweight passenger)
                        Turn around.  Maybe that will give 
                        me more room.

           The big woman starts turning around, but it’s not easy to 
           maneuver.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, like that...  Come here, 
                        beautiful...

           The big woman is now facing Decker.  She is not pretty.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (re: her face)
                        No, it was better the other way.  
                        The other way.
           There is ANOTHER KNOCK, even more impatient this time.

           INT. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE - OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A flight attendant, JANET, 50’s and man-ish, with no sense of 
           humor, is KNOCKING on the bathroom door.

                                 JANET
                             (through the door)
                        Decker?  Decker?  What are you 
                        doing in there?  It’s time to start 
                        the beverage cart.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 DECKER
                             (annoyed, through door)
                        Be right there, Janet!

                                 OVERWEIGHT PASSENGER
                        Beverage cart?  You told me you 
                        were the captain.

                                 DECKER
                        I am.  You think they give these 
                        wings to just anyone?

           Decker touches his CAPTAIN’S WINGS, and they fall from his 
           shirt.  They are the plastic kid’s kind held on by adhesive.  

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (re: wings)
                        Damn it.

                                 OVERWEIGHT PASSENGER
                        I don’t believe this.  I’m having 
                        sex with a gay flight attendant?

                                 DECKER
                        Hey, not all of us are gay.  Only 
                        ninety-six percent.  And you don’t 
                        strike me as the picky type, to be 
                        honest with you.

           The overweight passenger pulls up her clothes and tries to 
           exit.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 OVERWEIGHT PASSENGER
                        Back to my two seats.  
           The large woman tries to exit, but with both she and Decker 
           unable to move out of the way, there isn’t enough room for 
           the door to slide open and in.

                                 OVERWEIGHT PASSENGER (CONT’D)
                        Move over.

           The large woman shoves Decker back and pulls the door into 
           him again -- still trapped.

                                 DECKER
                             (getting hit by her)
                        Ow!  Jesus!  What happened?  A 
                        minute ago things were so romantic.  

                                 OVERWEIGHT PASSENGER
                        Just open the door.  I’m getting 
                        claustrophobic.

           Decker tries the door but it will only open a few inches. 

                                 DECKER
                        There’s no room for it to slide in.

                                 OVERWEIGHT PASSENGER
                        Oh, shit... The walls are closing 
                        in on me.  Oh, shit.
                             (woozy)
                        I think I’m going to throw up.

                                 DECKER
                        What?  No.  No!   

                                 OVERWEIGHT PASSENGER
                        Oh, shit.  Here it comes...

           Decker is now starting to panic, himself.  They are face to 
           face, and if she gets sick it’s going to be all over him.  He 
           looks for a place to climb or move, but there is none.

                                 DECKER
                        No, wait.  I have to get out of 
                        here.

                                 OVERWEIGHT PASSENGER
                        Oh, shit...

           Decker starts desperately banging on the door.

                                 DECKER
                        Let me out!  Let me out! 
           INT. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE - OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 JANET
                        Decker?  Is someone in there with 
                        you?

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 OVERWEIGHT PASSENGER
                             (about to get sick)
                        Oh, God --!

                                 DECKER
                        LET ME OUT!!!

           WE FREEZE on Decker’s panic-stricken face as he tries to 
           squeeze his head through a bathroom door that will only open 
           four inches.

           CHYRON: “THE ESCORT”

           EXT. WILDER FAMILY HOME - PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - DAY

           Establishing.  A nice home on the coast.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           THE CAMERA moves through a child’s birthday party in full-
           swing.  SIX-YEAR-OLDS running around...  A piñata...  A face 
           painter...  THE CAMERA passes over a cake, and we are 
           surprised to read, “HAPPY 14TH BIRTHDAY, ETHAN!”  WE MOVE ON, 
           past more little children playing, and LAND ON --

           ETHAN WILDER, 14, pretentious and self-conscious.  Wearing a 
           suit and tie, and black framed glasses, Ethan sits alone on a 
           love seat.  He looks depressed.

           KINGSLEY, Ethan’s six-year-old half-brother, approaches 
           Ethan.  Ethan stares at him, annoyed.

                                 ETHAN
                        What is it, Kingsley?

           Little Kingsley rears back and sucker-punches Ethan right in 
           the stomach.  Ethan lets out a GRUNT.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        You my bitch now!

           Kingsley runs away.
           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Ethan’s dad, DR. STEVEN WILDER, 45, a man used to getting 
           bossed around by the women in his life, is in the middle of 
           being bossed around by his second wife, BETH, early thirties, 
           plastic looking.  Beth is placing candles on Ethan’s cake.

                                 BETH
                        Go tell Ethan it’s time for his 
                        cake.  And have you talked to him 
                        about this weekend yet?

                                 STEVEN
                        Beth, I don’t think now is the time 
                        to--

                                 BETH
                        Talk to him.  Now.  Go.

                                 STEVEN
                        All right.

           Steven reluctantly goes. 

           INT. FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

           Steven enters and passes by Kingsley, who has his pants down 
           around his ankles and is PEEING ON ETHAN’S PILE OF WRAPPED 
           GIFTS.

                                 STEVEN
                        Kingsley!

           Kingsley’s head turns sharply to Steven, caught.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        I’m just giving Ethan his present.

           Kingsley runs from the hallway.  Steven shakes his head and 
           exits into the living room.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Steven sits down next to Ethan on the love seat.  It’s a 
           little forced and awkward.

                                 STEVEN
                        Great party, son.  Really one of 
                        your best.

           Ethan looks at his dad like he’s crazy.
                                 ETHAN
                        Really?  You don’t think this feels 
                        more like a party for Kingsley?

           Steven looks around at all the little kids playing.

                                 STEVEN
                        No!  No.  No.  Your step-mother 
                        just wanted you to have people to 
                        celebrate with and Kingsley’s 
                        friends were available.  I told you 
                        to invite kids your own age.

           Ethan looks away, and we can see that maybe there was no one 
           for him to invite.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Listen, something’s come up and I’m 
                        not going to be able to take you to 
                        New Hampshire.

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 STEVEN
                        I have to go out of town for this 
                        neonatal conference.  It just came 
                        up.  All of my colleagues are 
                        going.  There’s nothing I can do...  

           Ethan is clearly upset.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        But don’t worry.  The airline has 
                        people to take care of you.  And a 
                        representative from your new school 
                        will meet you when you land in 
                        Boston. 

           The seemingly cynical fourteen year-old Ethan acts more like 
           a scared child who’s on the verge of tears.

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t even want to go to boarding 
                        school. 

                                 STEVEN
                        Ethan...  Come on.  It’s going to 
                        be great.

                                 ETHAN
                        For who?  For Beth?  Now that she’s 
                        finally gotten rid of me so there’s 
                        no trace of your old life?
                                 STEVEN
                        That is not true.

           Ethan gets up and walks off, angry.  Steven goes after him.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?  Ethan?  It’s 
                        time for your cake.

           Ethan ignores his dad and continues walking away.  

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Beth now has Kingsley and the other children gathered by the 
           cake.  She sees Ethan approaching.

                                 BETH
                        Here he comes.
                             (to Kingsley)
                        Show time, Baby.

           Beth starts LIGHTING THE CANDLES on the cake.  Kingsley 
           stands tall, CLEARS HIS THROAT, and begins singing “Happy 
           Birthday” in a full-on BAD OPERA VOICE, complete with 
           excessive vibrato.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Happy Birthday to youuuu....

           Other kids start to sing, but Beth quickly stops them.

                                 BETH
                        Wait -- Nobody else sing.  I told 
                        King-King he could perform a solo.

           Confused, everyone stops singing as Kingsley continues to 
           perform.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Happy birthday to youuuuuuuuu...

           Ethan enters and walks right past them and exits into the 
           back hallway that leads to the bedrooms.  A frustrated 
           Steven, who has been following him, gives up.

           INT. ETHAN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           We follow Ethan as he enters and slams the door behind him.  
           He sits on his bed, upset and defeated, as we hear Kingsley 
           finish singing:
                                 KINGSLEY (O.S.)
                        Happy Birthday dear Ethannnnnn...  
                        Happy Birthday to...
                             (up two full octaves)
                        Youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!

           INT. UPSCALE OFFICE - DAY

           A large corner office.  Filled packing boxes yet to be moved 
           are on the floor.  A label on top of the boxes reads: “KATE 
           O’DONNELL, PRESIDENT, BLINK TELECOMMUNICATIONS.”  

           KATE, 40’S, no-nonsense, successful business type, picks up 
           her ringing cell phone.

                                 KATE
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT:

           INT. ETHAN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan is on his iPhone, a little nervous.  He gazes out his 
           window as cars pull away with the little kids from the party.   

                                 ETHAN
                        Mom?  It’s me, Ethan.

                                 KATE
                        Ethan, I was literally picking up 
                        the phone to wish you a happy 
                        birthday.  How are you?

           Ethan doesn’t say anything.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Ethan?

                                 ETHAN
                        I want to come live with you.  

                                 KATE
                        Oh, Sweetheart...  

                                 ETHAN
                        I promise to stay out of your way --

                                 KATE
                        Ethan...

                                 ETHAN
                        You can work as much as you want --
                                 KATE
                        Ethan -- I’m moving to London on 
                        Monday.  You know that.

                                 ETHAN
                        I could go with you.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, Honey.  Wouldn’t that be great?  
                        I would love that.  You’re sweet.

           Kate’s other line starts RINGING.  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Look, work is on the other line.  I 
                        have to run.  But I’ll call you 
                        back, okay?  Happy birthday, 
                        Sweetheart.

           Ethan’s mom hangs up, leaving Ethan disappointed.

           INT. MIAMI AIRPORT SECURITY CHECK-POINT - DAY

           CLOSE ON 

           Ethan’s step-mom, Beth, is straining to hold the end of a 
           taut leash as if an unseen, giant dog is pulling her from the 
           other end. 

           WIDEN TO REVEAL 

           Beth is holding Kingsley ON A KID LEASH.  The leash is taut 
           with Kingsley leaning forward at a forty-five degree angle to 
           the ground, like an old Buick hood ornament.

                                 KINGSLEY
                             (re: restaurant, 
                              longingly)
                        Wetzels.  I want a Wetzels.

                                 BETH
                        In a minute, baby.

           We see Steven, Kingsley and Beth are saying their good-byes 
           to a dour-looking Ethan.  Ethan is again in a suit and tie.

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        Now say goodbye to Ethan.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        No!
                             (to Ethan, defiant)
                        Hell-loooo!!!
           Beth laughs, embarrassed.

                                 BETH
                             (to Ethan)
                        Cute.  He doesn’t want you to go.  
                        Well, I’ll say goodbye from the 
                        both of --

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Wetzels!

           Kingsley takes off running, ripping the leash from Beth’s 
           grasp.  Beth immediately chases after him, trying 
           unsuccessfully to grab the leash as it drags on the ground 
           behind him.

                                 BETH
                        King-King?  King-King?

           Ethan and Steven stare after them for a beat.  Steven turns 
           back to Ethan and holds out a CREDIT CARD for him to take.

                                 STEVEN
                        It’s in your name.

           Ethan finally reaches for it.  Steven pulls it back. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT'D)
                        For emergencies...

           He gives it to Ethan. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        You know if I didn’t have this work 
                        thing I’d take you.  I would.  

           Ethan refuses to look at his dad. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Study hard.  And try to make 
                        some friends, Ethan.
                             (then)
                        Give me a hug. 

           Steven takes a step to Ethan and hugs him.  Ethan doesn’t 
           return it.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Are you not going to say good-bye?

           Ethan continues to look away from his dad.  Steven gives up.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Call me when you land.
           Steven nods to a ground crew representative, BRUCE, who has 
           been waiting to escort Ethan through security.

           Ethan and Bruce walk away as Steven watches his son go.  
           After a moment, Steven walks out of frame in the other 
           direction, and we are left looking at --

           AN AIRPORT TV MONITOR with CNN playing on it.

                                 CNN ANNOUNCER
                        Category Two Hurricane Kendra made 
                        landfall this morning just south of 
                        Charleston, South Carolina.  As it  
                        tracks north, the violent effects 
                        of this massive storm could 
                        possibly be felt as far as the 
                        Chesapeake Bay...

           INT. TERMINAL - DAY

           A depressed and angry Ethan walks down the terminal to the 
           gate.  

           He and Bruce enter the gate area where A DIGITAL SIGN reads: 
           “FLT. 662 BOSTON 10:45A ON TIME.”

           INT. COMMERCIAL JET - GALLEY - DAY

           In the rear of the plane, a hung-over Decker THROWS UP into 
           one of the sliding trash drawers.  

                                 DECKER
                             (groans)
                        DUHhhhh....

           He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.  A FEMALE 
           PASSENGER, waiting to use the lavatory, has seen all of this.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Just because I fly for a living 
                        doesn’t mean I’m not susceptible to 
                        air sickness.

                                 PASSENGER
                        We haven’t taken off yet.

           Decker looks at her and nods.  There’s nothing to really say.

           Decker helps himself to an airplane “mini” of Jack Daniels.  
           He chases it with another mini, then quickly hides the 
           evidence as another flight attendant, DENISE, 40’s, African 
           American, approaches.
                                 DENISE
                        A little hair of the dog that 
                        nipped ya?

           Decker exhales heavily, trying to shake the cobwebs out.

                                 DECKER
                        Yeah.  How you doing, Denise?

                                 DENISE
                        Better than you.  I heard you got 
                        demoted for humpin’ a fatty in the 
                        john and then trying to flush her 
                        down the toilet.

           Decker nods matter of factly.

                                 DECKER
                        Well, she threw up on me and then 
                        passed out and her face went into 
                        the toilet.  And then in my attempt 
                        to open the door I climbed on top of 
                        her and accidentally hit the flush 
                        button. 

                                 DENISE
                        What are you doing sloshing around 
                        in the muck with all them hoggers, 
                        Decker?  You a good looking white 
                        boy.  You don’t need to go slummin’ 
                        like you got disease or some shit.

                                 DECKER
                        I’m not slumming, Denise.  I’m just 
                        an equal opportunity lover.  And 
                        you’d think the airline would reward 
                        me for making their passengers feel 
                        good.  Honor me, even.  But no, I’m 
                        being punished... 

           Decker picks up a clipboard with papers on it.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        ...with paperwork, and freaks with 
                        peanut allergies, and Kosher meal 
                        weirdos...

           Decker looks up to see Bruce and Ethan making their way 
           toward them.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (re: Ethan, gravely)
                        And kids.  I hate kids.
                                 DENISE
                        Yeah, and this one looks nasty.

           Denise snickers and walks away as Bruce and Ethan approach 
           Decker.

                                 BRUCE
                        Decker, here’s your unaccompanied 
                        minor.  Ethan, say hello to your in-
                        flight escort, Decker.

           Ethan just stares straight ahead.  

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        All right.  Have fun, you two!

           Bruce can’t get off the plane fast enough.  Attached to 
           Ethan’s suit lapel is an “UNACCOMPANIED MINOR” sticker with 
           his name on it.  Decker looks at the sticker.

                                 DECKER
                        Ethan... my main man.  This your 
                        first time flying alone?

           Decker goes to clasp Ethan’s hand but Ethan doesn’t take it.

                                 ETHAN
                        Is that puke on your collar?

                                 DECKER
                        There’s a good chance.  A real good 
                        chance it is puke...
                             (trying to look)
                        ...on my collar...

           Ethan eyes Decker with disgust.

                                 ETHAN
                        It’s clear the airline assigned me 
                        their best and brightest.

                                 DECKER
                        Ha.  Actually, it was a rough 
                        flight in from Charlotte.  You 
                        know, just because I fly for a 
                        living doesn’t mean I’m not 
                        susceptible to--

                                 ETHAN
                        This isn’t math class, guy.  You 
                        don’t have to show all your work.  
                        Just tell me where I’m sitting and 
                        leave me alone.
           Decker is taken aback by how rude Ethan is.

                                 DECKER
                        Oh.  I’m sorry.  Your seat is right 
                        here...

           Decker quickly opens the door to the bathroom and SHOVES 
           ETHAN INTO IT, slamming the door behind him.  Ethan starts 
           YELLING and BANGING on the door as Decker holds it closed.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (through the door)
                        You like it in there, “guy?”

           Denise approaches with some pillows.

                                 DENISE
                        Where’s the kid?

           Decker nods to the bathroom with a smile.

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        Let me out!

           Denise can’t believe it.

                                 DENISE
                        Decker...

                                 DECKER
                             (re: bathroom)
                        What?  Isn’t this the place for a 
                        little shit?

           Denise snorts a laugh and continues on into the galley.  
           Decker finally lets go of the door and it quickly opens to 
           reveal an upset Ethan.

                                 ETHAN
                        What’s your problem?

                                 DECKER
                        What’s your problem?  Huh?  Huh?

           They glare at each other like two petulant kids.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        I thought so.

           Decker snatches Ethan’s boarding pass, and leads him down the 
           aisle.

                        Twenty-four “D”.

           Decker gestures to an aisle seat.  Ethan sits in it, annoyed.

                        I like this.  What we have.  This 
                        is going to be fun.

           EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           The plane takes off.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           The fasten seat-belt sign goes off with a DING.  The plane is 
           above a thick blanket of clouds.  A lonely Ethan looks across 
           the row of seats and out the window. 

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Folks, we’ve reached our cruising 
                        altitude.  I’m going to go ahead 
                        and turn off the seat-belt sign so 
                        you’re free to move about the 
                        cabin.  But we ask that while 
                        seated you keep those belts 
                        fastened...

           Across the aisle from Ethan is a very CUTE GIRL with her 
           parents.  Ethan notices her and steals glances at her.  She 
           looks up and catches him.  He awkwardly looks away, shy and 
           embarrassed.

           DECKER --

           hands a passenger a cocktail, and then approaches Ethan.

                                 DECKER
                        How you doing, buddy?  You doing 
                        okay?

           Ethan blatantly ignores Decker.

                        Look, I think we got started off on 
                        the wrong foot.  To be honest, I’m 
                        all banged up from last night.  I 
                        was at an airport hotel lounge in 
                        Louisville.

                        Ever been to Louisville?  Those 
                        Kentucky girls can drink some 
                        Bourbon.  I must have had ten, I 
                        shit you not.  And drinking’s not 
                        all they’re good at.  Blow-jobs 
                        were everywhere.  My point is, I’m 
                        sorry for tossing you in the can.  

           Decker hands Ethan a pair of CHILDREN’S PLASTIC CAPTAIN’S 
           WINGS like he was wearing in the opening bathroom scene.

                        Well I’m not giving them to you.  
                        You have to pay six dollars for 
                        them.  Part of the airline’s effort 
                        to cut costs.

                        How old do you think I am?

           Decker considers Ethan.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll spare you the pain of counting 
                        beyond the limits of your fingers.  
                        I’m fourteen.  Did you play with 
                        wings when you were fourteen?

           Decker takes the wings back, understanding.

                                 DECKER
                        No, I played with something else 
                        until I saw blood.  Red means stop.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Decker returns to Ethan’s seat holding a PORN MAGAZINE.  He 
           looks around to make sure no one sees him give it to Ethan. 

                                 DECKER

                        Mall catalog.

           The self-conscious Ethan blushes, totally embarrassed.
                                 ETHAN
                        Is this porn?

                                 DECKER

                        Boston, so don’t lose it.

           Ethan is worried someone is going to see him with it. 

                                 ETHAN
                        What am I supposed to do with this?

                                 DECKER
                             (scoffs in disbelief)
                        What?  What are--?  

           Decker scoffs again, and looks at Ethan like he’s a freak.  

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, but if you have to ask 
                        what you’re supposed to do with 
                        these thunder tats...  

           Decker quickly snatches the magazine back from Ethan and 
           opens it to a prime photo of A NAKED PAIR OF BREASTS.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        Boom!  Right there, look at that... 

           Decker gets momentarily distracted by the picture, himself.

                             (snapping out of it)
                        Then I can’t trust you with it.

           Decker rolls the magazine up and puts it in his pocket.  
           Ethan seems at once relieved and disappointed.

                                 ETHAN
                        Look -- what’s your name again?

                                 DECKER
                        Decker.  As in “Double Decker,” a 
                        move I patented with two nurses in 
                        Pittsburgh.  Maybe you’ve heard of 
                        it?

                        Listen to me, because I’m only 
                        going to say this once.  Despite 
                        what your airline says, I’m old 
                        enough to travel on my own...
           Ethan rips off his “Unaccompanied Minor” sticker and slaps it 
           on the seat-back in front of him.

                        again.

           Ethan puts on his headphones and closes his eyes.  Decker 
           stands there a beat.  He can’t believe this kid.

                                 DECKER

           approaches and empties some trash.

                        want to hang out with him anyway.  
                        I mean, if he doesn’t like me, then 
                        I don’t like him.  I don’t need 
                        that kind of rejection.

           Decker starts to walk off with the tray of coffee.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        He’s dead to me.

           Denise is left surprised at just how sensitive Decker is.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Decker stands with his elbow on a seat-back, hitting on an 
           unattractive, sloppy, slutty-looking passenger in her late 
           forties, CRYSTAL.  Her muffin-top is not only spilling over 
           her jeans, but the sides of the seat, as well. 

                                 DECKER
                        ...All because you were allergic to 
                        peanuts?  You poor thing.  Okay, 
                        say we’re at a baseball game, and I 
                        eat two bags of peanuts...  
           ETHAN --

           is sitting in the aisle-seat directly behind Crystal.  He has 
           been watching in disbelief as Decker hits on her.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        And say you and I, you know, we hit 
                        it off...

           Decker and Crystal share a giggle.

                                 CRYSTAL
                        Uh-huh...

                        Yes.  Will I shoot to kill?

           Ethan can’t believe the conversation these two are having.

                                 CRYSTAL
                        I don’t know.  But I like living on 
                        the edge.

                        Ho-ho!  Me, too.  I fly planes.  
                        Flight attendant is just a means to 
                        an end for me.  I’m working my way 
                        up to senior flight attendant by 
                        next year, copilot the year after.  
                        At that point, pilot is just a 
                        formality.

           Ethan can’t help but butt-in and dispute Decker.

                             (re: Janet and Denise)

                        takes to be Top Gun like me.  And 
                        who asked you anyway, you little 
                        puss-face?

           Decker and Ethan glare at each other for a beat.  Decker 
           returns his attention to Crystal.

                        was born to fly these birds --

           BOOM!!!  There is a quick EXPLOSION and a flash of light on 
           the starboard side of the aircraft.

           The PLANE DROPS SUDDENLY.  Passengers collectively let out a

           JANET --

           is on the phone with the cockpit.  She listens for a moment 
           and quickly hangs up.  She presses another button TO SPEAK TO

           DENISE --

           is doing her best to reassure the people in the rear of the 
           plane.

                                 DENISE
                        I’m sure it’s just a small 
                        mechanical malfunction.  Nothing to 
                        be alarmed by.

           DECKER --

           We see his attempt to calm the passengers near him.

                        We’re going down, people.  
                        Something is wrong here.  This is 
                        not good.
           ETHAN --

           looks scared.  He quickly pulls off the “Unaccompanied Minor” 
           sticker he slapped on the seat-back in front of him, and 
           nervously sticks it back on his suit.

           WIDE SHOT

           The plane dips sharply again and the passengers let out 
           another GASP.

           DECKER --

           is freaking out.

                        The plane can’t hold up much 
                        longer.  Where are the masks?  Drop 
                        the masks!

           Decker bangs on the overhead.  Janet has steadied herself 
           through the turbulence, and reaches Decker.  

                                 JANET
                        We lost an engine.  Now quit 
                        scaring the passengers and act like 
                        a professional.  

           Ethan can hear what Janet is saying to Decker.  

           The PLANE SUDDENLY LEVELS OUT.  The passengers breathe a sigh 
           of relief.  Decker tries to act like he was never scared.

           Decker rests a hand on a frail OLD WOMAN’S shoulder.

                        Especially when “Old Lead Foot” 
                        here gets behind the wheel.  Am I 
                        right, Mrs. Cataracts?  

           Decker continues down the aisle.  Crystal stops him.

                                 CRYSTAL
                             (re: airplane)
                        What was that?
                                 DECKER
                             (smug)
                        I’d say, just by listening to the 
                        sound of the thrust... you hear 
                        that?  It takes a trained ear.  I’d 
                        say we lost an engine.

           The captain comes on the LOUD SPEAKER.

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Folks, it appears we lost our 
                        number two engine --

           Decker holds up his hands, victorious.

                                 DECKER
                        Called it.

           He starts high-fiving some of the frightened passengers.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Totally called it.

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Good news is, we still have two 
                        other engines.  Unfortunately, they 
                        can’t take us as high or as fast as 
                        we need to go.

           The captain checks off temporarily.  Decker turns to Crystal.

                                 DECKER
                        Did I call it or what?  Give me a 
                        hug.

           Ethan butts in.

                                 ETHAN
                        You didn’t call anything.  
                             (re: Janet)
                        She told you what happened.  I 
                        heard her.

                                 DECKER
                        Why don’t you shut up, you little 
                        shi-- 

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        So, we’re going to go ahead and 
                        land at the nearest airport, which 
                        happens to be Charlottesville, 
                        Virginia.  Flight attendants 
                        prepare for immediate landing.
                                 DECKER
                             (to Ethan)
                        You’re lucky I just got an order.

                                 ETHAN
                        Or what?  You’d start crying again?

                                 DECKER
                        Watch it.  I’m serious.  I am fully 
                        authorized to use plastic tie 
                        handcuffs on you.
                             (realizing)
                        Except I left them in my condo -- 
                        damn it!

           The plane drops and Decker reacts, scared.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Whoa!

           Decker quickly half-crawls/half-walks back toward the front 
           of the plane.

           EXT. RUNWAY - DAY

           The plane approaches the tarmac at Charlottesville Airport.  
           It touches down and BRAKES HARD TO A STOP. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan breathes a sigh of relief, as many of the passengers 
           APPLAUD the safe landing.

           INT. CHARLOTTESVILLE AIRPORT GATE - DAY

           Relief to be alive has quickly turned to frustration.  The 
           passengers are all huddled around the gate counter trying to 
           find out how they are going to get to their final 
           destinations.  The inundated airline employee working behind 
           the counter is JUDY, INCREDIBLY PREGNANT.  

                                 JUDY
                             (into P.A. microphone)

                        going to get you on to your final

                        However, it does take a plane to do 
                        that and we have none.  And with 
                        the hurricane suspending all 
                        flights, we’re looking at tomorrow 
                        morning, first thing, fingers 
                        crossed.

           The crowd reacts with more MURMURS of anger and frustration.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        I know.  No one likes waiting.

                        me so long she’s going to walk out.

           ETHAN --

           is in the crowd, anxious and unsure what to do, like a kid 
           separated from his mom in a mall. 

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Now as part of our “No-Further-

                        airport hotel with room for your 
                        RV...

           INT. CHARLOTTESVILLE AIRPORT GATE - DAY

           Ethan is getting pushed aside by the annoyed THRONGS OF 
           PASSENGERS trying to get a HOTEL VOUCHER from Judy.  The sky 
           outside has darkened and RAIN starts pounding the large 
           windows in the terminal.

                                 JUDY
                             (handing out vouchers)
                        One night free...  Room for your 
                        RV...

           Ethan finds himself unable to even get near the counter.  
           Frustrated, he finally goes around the mass of people and 
           simply walks behind the counter to stand next to Judy.

                                 ETHAN
                        What am I supposed to do?  I’m 
                        this...

           Ethan is embarrassed to show his “UNACCOMPANIED MINOR” 
           sticker, but does so anyway.
                                 JUDY
                             (calling out suddenly)
                        A minor!  We have a minor!

           Judy grabs Ethan and hugs him to her chest, protectively.

                                 ETHAN
                        Why are you hugging me?

                                 JUDY
                        I don’t know.  My maternal 
                        instincts are off the charts right 
                        now.

           Judy starts crying.

                                 ETHAN
                        Why are you crying?

                                 JUDY
                             (crying)
                        I don’t know.

           Judy holds Ethan at arms length, looking at him.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Where is your escort?

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t have one.

           Judy gasps.

                                 JUDY
                        But they wouldn’t let you on that 
                        plane without one.  Somebody had to 
                        have been assigned to you.

           Ethan scans the gate and reluctantly points.

                                 ETHAN
                        He was.

           DECKER --

           is pulling his rolling suitcase shaped like the HOOD OF A 
           ROLLS-ROYCE (with the suitcase wheels as front tires), as he 
           struts across the gate area hitting on Crystal.  

                                 DECKER
                        ...what do you say we go back to 
                        the hotel, I get a bag of peanuts 
                        and we play a little Russian 
                        Roulette?
           Decker looks up and notices Ethan pointing at him.  His face 
           falls.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           INT. AIRPORT GATE - DAY

           Judy is lecturing Decker.  Ethan is standing between them.  
           Off to the side, Crystal is waiting impatiently.

                                 JUDY
                        You can’t just abandon your charge, 
                        Mr. Decker.

                                 DECKER
                        I didn’t abandon him.  He abandoned 
                        me.  And I have abandonment issues.

                                 JUDY
                        That is unacceptable as an excuse.  
                        Who is the child here? 

                          DECKER
                                                          ETHAN
           He is.
                                              He is.

           Decker notices Crystal starting to leave.

                                 DECKER
                        Wait -- you’re leaving?

                                 CRYSTAL
                        You look like you have your hands 
                        full.  Maybe another time.

           Crystal walks away.  Decker turns back to Judy and Ethan, 
           annoyed.

                                 DECKER
                        More abandonment.  Great.  Thank 
                        you for ruining something very 
                        special.

                                 ETHAN
                        You should be thanking us.  She was 
                        horrible.

                                 DECKER
                             (glaring at Ethan)
                        I swear to God, I will pummel you.  

                                 JUDY
                        Mister Decker!
                                 DECKER
                        I wouldn’t really hit him.  I just 
                        want to.

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t approve of how he talks to 
                        me.  

                                 DECKER
                        I don’t approve of how he talks, 
                        period.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh, so that gives you the right to 
                        lock me in the bathroom? 

           Judy looks to Decker for an explanation.  Decker is ashamed.

                                 JUDY
                        Is this true?

                                 DECKER
                        I didn’t lock him in there.  We 
                        were goofing around.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh, is that what that was?  Were we 
                        also goofing around when you called 
                        me names, told me details of your 
                        sordid night in Kentucky, or tried 
                        to force me to look at pornography?

           Judy is taken aback.  She looks to Decker for his response to 
           such accusations.  Decker can only glare in disappointment at 
           Ethan.  Judy turns back to Ethan.

                                 JUDY
                        I am so sorry.  On behalf of all of 
                        us here at Sunshine Express, I

                        have a seat while Mister Decker and 
                        I have a little chat.

           Ethan is seated in the gate area, talking on his iPhone.

                        The engine blew up.  I almost died.  
                        But it was worth it because in the 
                        end I get to go to boarding school.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Stop it, Ethan.  I just want to 
                        know if you’re all right.

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m fine.

           Beth is in the backseat with Kingsley, who is dressed like a 
           thirties paper-boy with overalls and a cap turned sideways.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Did Ethan die in a plane crash?

                                 BETH
                        Quiet, Sweetheart, Daddy is on the 
                        phone.

           Ethan is confused when he hears their voices.

                                 ETHAN
                        What are you doing with Beth and 
                        Kingsley?  You told me you were at 
                        a conference.

           Beth looks at Steven, surprised.

                                 BETH
                        You didn’t tell him about Lloyd 
                        Gervin?

           Steven is clearly busted.  He quickly picks up his phone, 
           taking it off speaker.

                                 STEVEN
                             (into phone)
                        Ethan, I didn’t want you to be 
                        jealous.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVEN (CONT'D)
                        An acting agent for kids -- Lloyd 
                        Gervin -- has come to Miami to 
                        scout for talent, and he’s agreed 
                        to meet with Kingsley about getting 
                        him into the movies.  

                                 ETHAN
                        That’s why you couldn’t take me to 
                        school?

                                 STEVEN
                        Well these agents are very slick 
                        and your step mother was worried he 
                        was going to put a contract in 
                        front of her and the next thing we 
                        know she’s sold Kingsley to the 
                        circus.

                                 ETHAN
                        It’s where he belongs.

                                 STEVEN
                             (whispering into phone)
                        I’m in a really tough spot here, 
                        Ethan.  But I’m going to see you 
                        Parents’ Weekend.  And Thanksgiving --

           Unable to listen any longer, an angry Ethan hangs up on his 
           dad.  After a beat, Ethan’s phone starts RINGING again and he 
           immediately hits “DECLINE.” 

           Steven gets Ethan’s outgoing message on his VOICE-MAIL.

                                 ETHAN (V.O.)
                             (sighs, then dour)
                        Leave a message...

                                 STEVEN
                             (into phone)
                        You cut out.  I’ll check with the 
                        airline to find out when your new 
                        flight is and let the school know.  
                        Don’t worry. 

           INT. CHARLOTTESVILLE AIRPORT TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS

           An upset Ethan puts his phone away and looks over to the 
           other side of the gate where --

           A SENIOR AIRLINE OFFICIAL, along with Judy and Janet, are 
           talking privately with Decker.  The airline official is 
           clearly LAYING INTO HIM.  
           The wind has picked up and the RAIN IS FALLING HARD behind 
           them, visible through the large terminal windows.  

           When the tongue lashing ends, Decker nods and pulls his 
           rolling suitcase over to where Ethan is seated.  Decker 
           appears a little dazed.

                                 DECKER
                        So, uh, I’m done.

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 DECKER
                        Yeah.  Done.  Let go.

                                 ETHAN
                        Like, fired?

                                 DECKER
                        Yeah.  Finished.  Four years here, 
                        it’s over.  Thanks.

           Ethan doesn’t know what to say.  Decker shakes his head and 
           starts to go.  But he turns back to Ethan, upset.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you have to be such a baby?  
                        When I was your age I would have 
                        killed to have a bad ass flight 
                        attendant show me his porn.  Or 
                        talk about girls blowing him.  You 
                        know how cool that is?  And I 
                        probably would have let you watch 
                        me bang that peanut slut if you 
                        wanted.  You know why?  ‘Cause I’m 
                        a nice guy.  And I was trying to be 
                        your friend.  Do even you have any 
                        friends?

           Ethan can’t look at Decker.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        No?  Well, it’s not hard to figure 
                        out why.  You’re an asshole.  
                        Sitting there in your suit, like my 
                        dad, only you’re in a suit.  Trying 
                        so hard to look like a man when 
                        it’s bullshit.  But you fooled me, 
                        because I treated you like one, and 
                        I paid the price.

           Decker gives up and starts to walk away.
                                 ETHAN
                        This isn’t my fault.

           Decker scoffs.

                                 DECKER
                        Whatever.

           Decker walks off in disgust.  Ethan’s eyes have welled up 
           with tears.   

           ON A NEARBY TELEVISION MONITOR --

           CNN is reporting.

                                 CNN ANNOUNCER
                        As Hurricane Kendra continues to 
                        bounce up the southern Atlantic 
                        coast, beach towns brace for the 
                        worst...

           Judy --

           waddles over to Ethan, rubbing her massively pregnant belly.  
           Ethan wipes his eyes, quickly hiding any evidence of tears.

                                 JUDY
                        Okay, Ethan, my dear.  Looks like 
                        you’re in luck.  We’re going to set 
                        you up with a really cool escort 
                        for the night.  His name is Totally 
                        Awesome Todd.  He does characters, 
                        impressions, magic tricks, you name 
                        it.  And he’s going to hang with 
                        you until we can get you out of 
                        here, m’kay?

           Ethan turns to see in --

           THE ADJACENT GATE --

           TOTALLY AWESOME TODD, 30’s, a big goober with a CLOWN WIG, 
           making balloon animals for TWO YOUNG CHILDREN.

                                 ETHAN
                             (under his breath)
                        Oh, no...

                                 JUDY
                        Now sit tight, hon, while I go tell 
                        Totally Awesome he’s got a new 
                        friend.

           Pregnant Judy lumbers away in obvious discomfort.  
           Ethan anxiously looks down the terminal corridor and spots 
           Decker disappearing into the sea of travellers.

           JUDY --

           is on her way over to the other gate, when she suddenly stops 
           in pain.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                             (holding her side)
                        Ohhhh...  OH--!!!

           ETHAN --

           watches as a commotion develops around JUDY IN LABOR.  
           AIRPORT and AIRLINE PERSONNEL descend on her to help.

           Ethan takes this in.  We see his POV as he considers: 

           -- Totally Awesome Todd miming going down an escalator to his 
           two young charges...

           -- Judy being helped onto a SECURITY CART...

           -- The hurricane swirl graphic on the nearby television...

           -- The long terminal corridor where Decker has disappeared...

           With everyone’s attention on Judy, Ethan grabs his rolling 
           suitcase and makes a break for it.  He walks quickly down the 
           terminal corridor. 

           INT. CHARLOTTESVILLE AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           On the “PEOPLE MOVER.”  A depressed Decker, head hanging, 
           lets the conveyor carry him along as people with destinations 
           and purpose walk quickly past him.

           Ethan finally catches up to him.  Ethan walks on the ground, 
           keeping pace with Decker, who stands stationary on the 
           “People Mover.”  Decker is annoyed to see Ethan.

                                 DECKER
                        What do you want?

                                 ETHAN
                        What are you going to do now?

                                 DECKER
                        What do you care?
                                 ETHAN
                        I never meant for you to lose your 
                        job.

           Decker only softens slightly, but considers Ethan’s question.

                                 DECKER
                        I don’t know.  Maybe go back to 
                        selling shoes at Nordstroms.  But I 
                        hate feet. 
                             (at a loss)
                        I don’t know. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Well, I just got off the phone with 
                        my dad who said he’d pay you to 
                        escort me to my mom’s house.  It’s 
                        in Albany.  That’s where I’m going.

                                 DECKER
                        I thought you were going to Boston?

                                 ETHAN
                        My mom was in Boston, on business.  
                        But with all the delays, she’ll be 
                        back home.

                                 DECKER
                        In Albany?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.  We’re moving to London 
                        tomorrow so I really need to get 
                        there.

           The “People Mover” ends and Decker gets off.  Ethan stops 
           walking, and they stand there.

                                 DECKER
                        Why do you want me to take you?  I 
                        thought you hated me.

                                 ETHAN
                        I can’t get there alone.  And am I 
                        right to assume you have money 
                        problems?

                                 DECKER
                        Of course I have money problems.  
                        What kind of question is that?  Do 
                        I have money problems...?  

                                 ETHAN
                        Then what do you say?
           Decker struggles with Ethan’s proposition.

                                 DECKER
                        Albany...  What about Vegas?  You 
                        want to go to Vegas?

                                 ETHAN
                        What?  Were you even listening?  I 
                        have to get to Albany.

                                 DECKER
                        But I hate Albany.  I hate it.  I 
                        have a real problem with that town.

                                 ETHAN
                        My dad said he’d pay you a hundred 
                        dollars.

           Decker scoffs.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, two hundred.

                                 DECKER
                        Is this a joke?

                                 ETHAN
                        Well, how much do you want?

                                 DECKER
                        To go back to Albany?  

           Decker thinks about it.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Five thousand.

                                 ETHAN
                             (quickly)
                        Okay.

                                 DECKER
                             (stunned)
                        Really?

           INT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Decker and Ethan enter the train station and pull their 
           suitcases toward the ticket window. 

                                 ETHAN
                        My dad said you had to carry my 
                        bags.
                                 DECKER
                        Your dad is high.
                             (then)
                        I was thinking I should probably 
                        talk to him, you know, just to make 
                        sure he’s down with this.  It’s a 
                        lot of money.  I mean I’m totally 
                        worth it, but still...

                                 ETHAN
                        He’s down with it.

                                 DECKER
                        I’d feel better just making sure, 
                        you know?

                                 ETHAN
                        Fine.

           Ethan takes out his phone and makes it look like he’s dialing 
           when he really isn’t.  He pretends to listen for a moment.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Decker, lying)
                        His voice-mail.
                             (into phone)
                        Hey Dad, Decker agreed to our deal 
                        and we’re getting on the next train 
                        out.

           Ethan shoves the phone up to Decker’s face.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Say something.

           Decker is suddenly self-conscious.

                                 DECKER
                        Me?  Oh, um...  
                             (into phone, tentative)
                        Hello...?
                             (to Ethan, whispering)
                        What’s his name?

                                 ETHAN
                        Doctor Steven Wilder.

                             (whispering)
                        He’s a doctor?!  Why didn’t you 
                        tell me?  I don’t want to sound 
                        stupid.
                                 ETHAN
                        Too late. 

           Ethan pulls the phone back.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Call us back if you want.  Bye.

           Ethan “hangs up” and continues toward the ticket window.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on.  You don’t get your money 
                        unless I get to my mom’s in time.

           Decker follows.

                                 DECKER
                        How did I do on the call?  You 
                        think I did all right?  Seriously.  
                        ‘Cause I’m not great on the phone.  
                        People say I’m more charming in 
                        person...

           INT. TRAIN STATION TICKET WINDOW - DAY

           Ethan is paying A CLERK for the train tickets with his NEW 
           CREDIT CARD.  He signs the receipt as Decker stands by.

                                 DECKER
                             (can’t believe it)
                        Going back to Albany.  Shit...  

                                 ETHAN
                        What’s your problem with Albany, 
                        anyway?

           Decker isn’t sure if he wants to talk about it.

                                 DECKER
                        My ex-girlfriend lives there.  
                        Don’t ask me about it.

                                 ETHAN
                        Why didn’t things work out?

           Ethan takes the receipt and their tickets.

                                 DECKER
                        I just said -- It’s complicated, 
                        all right?  

           They start walking toward the exit to the train platforms.
                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        She wanted to get married and I 
                        couldn’t pull the trigger.  

                                 ETHAN
                        That doesn’t sound complicated.

                                 DECKER
                        It seemed complicated at the time.  
                        Look, I don’t want to talk about 
                        it.  

                                 ETHAN
                        So, what was it?  You didn’t love 
                        her?

                                 DECKER
                        Don’t you dare say that.  I loved 
                        her to death.  We were together for 
                        six years.  Jen was the best thing 
                        that ever happened to me.

                                 ETHAN
                        Then what was the problem?

                                 DECKER
                        What’s every guy’s problem being 
                        married?  It can only be to one 
                        woman.

           Ethan nods, but not really understanding.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        There was too much unexplored 
                        calzone out there.  I wasn’t ready 
                        to give that up.  And I wasn’t 
                        going to cheat on Jenny.  That’s my 
                        biggest fear in life, being 
                        unfaithful.  Like my dad was.  I 
                        don’t ever want to be that guy.

           Decker falls introspective for a beat.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        You ever cheat on a girl?

                                 ETHAN
                        What do you think?  I’ve never had 
                        a girl to cheat on.

                                 DECKER
                        You a virgin?
                                 ETHAN
                        I’m fourteen.

                                 DECKER
                        Have you finger-banged a girl?

           Ethan is embarrassed.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        No?  Do you even have hair on your 
                        balls?

           Ethan can’t believe Decker just asked him that.

                                 ETHAN
                        That’s none of your business.

                                 DECKER
                        I just want to know what you’re 
                        working with here.  You got serious 
                        hair or a couple of plugs?

                                 ETHAN
                        How old are you?

                                 DECKER
                        Thirty-four.

           Ethan nods toward a few people waiting to board the train.

                                 ETHAN
                        Go ask one of those people if they 
                        think it’s weird that a thirty-four 
                        year old man is asking a fourteen 
                        year old boy about his balls.

           EXT. VIRGINIA COUNTRY-SIDE - RAINING - DAY

           The train passes through lush, green forest, as the outlying 
           storm from Hurricane Kendra continues to blow.

           INT. MOVING TRAIN - DAY

           The train is full.  Decker is casually flipping through his 
           PORN MAGAZINE (the one he momentarily loaned to Ethan on the 
           plane).  Ethan is listening to music on his iPhone but can’t 
           help but sneak curious peaks at Decker’s magazine.  Decker 
           looks up from his magazine and out at the wet, verdant 
           countryside going past.  He suddenly perks up.
                                 DECKER
                        You know, I think this is where 
                        Jack Jouett made his famous ride.
                             (off Ethan’s blank stare)
                        Jack Jouett?  Jack Jouett?  You 
                        don’t know Jack Jouett?  

                                 ETHAN
                        No, I don’t know Jack Jouett.  How 
                        many times are you going to say his 
                        name?

                                 DECKER
                        Oh, you got to know the story of 
                        Jack Jouett.  In seventeen eighty-
                        one, this bad-ass British Colonel, 
                        Banastre “The Butcher” Tarleton, 
                        and his band of troops known as the 
                        Green Dragoons were on the hunt for 
                        Thomas Jefferson after he signed 
                        the Declaration of Independence.  
                        T. Jeff and his boys were hiding 
                        out at Monticello.  And this dude, 
                        Jack Jouett...

                                 ETHAN
                             (being a smart-ass)
                        What’s his name again?

                                 DECKER
                        Jack Jouett.  He spotted the 
                        British and made an insane ride on 
                        his horse, Sallie, through these 
                        woods here, forty miles without 
                        stopping, to warn Tommy Jeff, 
                        Benjamin Harrison and Patrick Henry 
                        that “The Butcher” was coming.  The 
                        good guys were able to exit stage 
                        left, and old Jack Jouett became 
                        one of the heroes of The 
                        Revolution.  

           Ethan studies Decker.

                                 ETHAN
                        How do you know all that?

           Decker shrugs, not thinking much of it.

                                 DECKER
                        I dunno.

           He returns to his porno magazine.

           Ethan can’t help but sneak a peak at the magazine over 
           Decker’s shoulder.  After a long beat:

                             (re: magazine)

                                 DECKER
                        What?

           Ethan’s a little shy to say.

                                 ETHAN
                        If they’re fake?

           Decker opens his porno magazine back up and starts pointing 
           out VARIOUS SHOTS OF WOMEN and their NAKED BREASTS.

           Decker shows Ethan the cover.

                        Get up.  Field trip.

           INT. MOVING TRAIN - DAY

           Decker walks closely behind Ethan as they make their way up 
           the aisle of the train.  They are looking down at all the 
           SEATED FEMALE PASSENGERS, trying to inconspicuously catalog 
           their breasts.  They WHISPER AS THEY WALK:

                                 DECKER
                        Left.  Against the window...

           Ethan looks at a WOMAN, and then down at her large breasts.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        See the train jiggle those?  Means 
                        they’re real.  But they’re sloppy.  
                        The lesson here being bigger isn’t 
                        always better.  Believe me.  You 
                        let those out of that bra and 
                        they’ll run from you like a couple 
                        of feral cats.
           ANOTHER WOMAN --

                                 ETHAN
                             (re: her breasts)
                        Real?

                                 DECKER
                        Correct.

           ANOTHER WOMAN --  

           Her breasts are large.

                                 ETHAN
                        Fake.

                                 DECKER
                        Good.  Look who’s getting the hang 
                        of the hangers?

                                 ETHAN
                             (realizing)
                        I think my step-mom has fake ones.

                                 DECKER
                        She single?

           Ethan looks at Decker like he’s retarded.

                                 ETHAN
                        No.  She’s my step-mom.  
                             (then)
                        I wish she was single.  

                                 DECKER
                        So you could have her?
                             (finally getting it)
                        Oh, so your dad wouldn’t be with 
                        her -- gotcha.

                                 ETHAN
                        She’s pretty much a nightmare.  And 
                        he always picks her over me.

                                 DECKER
                        Nah, I’m sure there’s room in his 
                        life for both of you.

                                 ETHAN
                        I’ve never seen it.

           It’s a rare moment of Ethan opening up, and it’s not lost on 
           Decker.  He nods, understanding.
                                 DECKER
                        I had a step-mom.  Hated her.  But 
                        with a little time, she changed.  
                        Yeah, she got three to five years 
                        for coming at my dad with a steak 
                        knife.  Prison definitely improved 
                        our relationship -- Absence makes 
                        the heart grow fonder, all that 
                        bullshit.  Now, I’m not suggesting 
                        it’s going to take your dad 
                        cheating on your step-mom like mine 
                        did, and her trying to cut his nuts 
                        off for your relationship to 
                        improve, but I am saying people 
                        change.  Remember that.  

           Ethan isn’t convinced.  They move on.

           A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN IN A SUNDRESS --  

           Her breasts are large for her slim frame and she is showing 
           cleavage.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (re: her breasts)
                        Your final exam.  You get this 
                        right and you’re a board certified 
                        plastic surgeon.  Now take your 
                        time...  Really think it through...  
                        Focus...

           Ethan is annoyed that Decker won’t let him answer.  Finally:

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m going to say fake.

                                 DECKER
                        I have no idea.  I’ll ask her.

           Ethan quickly turns anxious.

                                 ETHAN
                             (stopping Decker)
                        No!  Don’t.

                                 DECKER
                        I’m kidding.  I’m not that stupid.  
                        You’re going to ask her --
                             (to young woman)
                        Excuse me, Miss?  This young man 
                        has a question for you.

           Ethan blushes, flustered.
                                 ETHAN
                        No, I...

           He awkwardly pushes Decker out of the way, and moves past.

           INT. MOVING TRAIN - DAY

           Ethan plops down in his seat, upset.  After a beat, Decker 
           sits down next to him, laughing.

                                 ETHAN
                        I can’t believe you did that? 

                                 DECKER
                        Did what?  Give you the perfect in 
                        with the perfect girl?  

                                 ETHAN
                        You made me look stupid in front of 
                        her.

                                 DECKER
                        No, you made you look stupid.  I 
                        made you look awesome, until you 
                        blew it.

           Ethan pouts.  Decker can see just how upset he is.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Ah, don’t worry about it.  You’ll 
                        get the next one.

           They ride in silence for a little as the rain streaks down 
           their window.  Suddenly, the TRAIN SLOWS TO A STOP.

                                 ETHAN
                        Why are we stopping?

           Ethan and Decker look outside -- they are still very much in 
           the middle of nowhere.

           EXT. VIRGINIA WOODS - TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

           A HUGE DOWNED OAK TREE.  The storm from Kendra has blown it 
           over and it has fallen across the train tracks.  TRAIN 
           OFFICIALS are trying to figure out what to do.

           INT. STOPPED TRAIN - DAY

           Ethan is sitting alone, sneaking a few anxious peaks at a 
           cute teenage girl seated nearby.  
           The automatic doors in the front of the car SLIDE OPEN and 
           Decker enters.  He approaches Ethan.

                                 DECKER
                        They’re saying it could be three 
                        hours before they get the tree off 
                        the tracks.

                                 ETHAN
                        Three hours?  

                                 DECKER
                        No way we’re making our connecting 
                        train in Philly.

           Decker thinks for a beat.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Get your bag.  

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 DECKER
                        Let’s go.  The rain is letting up.  
                        There’s a road that leads into a 
                        town over there.  I saw the water 
                        tower.

           Ethan looks out the window.  The rain is, in fact, letting 
           up.  And he can see the road.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        I say we use that credit card of 
                        yours to rent a car and drive the 
                        rest of the way.    

                                 ETHAN
                        Drive?

                                 DECKER
                        Yeah.  Road trip!  Come on.

           Decker grabs his bag.

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t think it’s a good idea to 
                        leave the train.

                                 DECKER
                        You’re so uptight.  I know what I’m 
                        talking about.

                        If this were a plane and I’m 
                        telling passengers three hours, 
                        behind the scenes they’re telling 
                        me we’re in T-Barney-Rubble, okay?  
                        I’m serious now. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Really?

                                 DECKER
                        You want to get to your mom’s or 
                        not?

           Ethan considers.

           EXT. VIRGINIA COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Decker and Ethan are on the side of an old country road 
           staring up at a water tower.  The storm has resumed and it’s 
           POURING RAIN.  They look miserable.

                                 ETHAN
                        There’s no town.

                                 DECKER
                        There has to be a town.  How can 
                        there be a water tower and no town? 

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t know.  But I don’t see a 
                        town.

                                 DECKER
                        Whoever put this water tower here 
                        is officially the worst water tower 
                        guy in the game.  I guarantee you 
                        he was fired after this one.  

           Ethan is upset.

                                 ETHAN
                        What are we going to do?  I told 
                        you we shouldn’t have left the 
                        train.  

                                 DECKER
                        Forget the train.  The train was 
                        done.  It wasn’t an option.

           The train suddenly goes ROARING PAST THEM on the nearby 
           tracks.  Ethan throws his bag down in frustration.
                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t know why I listened to you.

                                 DECKER
                        Stop your crying.  I’m sure a car 
                        will come along soon.  We’ll just 
                        hitch a ride.

                                 ETHAN
                        We can’t hitch a ride.  It’s 
                        illegal.

           Decker has set down his bag and proceeds to PEE on the side 
           of the road. 

                                 DECKER
                        Jesus, it’s like I’m with my 
                        uptight, five-year-old grandmother.  
                        Just because something is illegal 
                        doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it.

                                 ETHAN
                        No, that’s precisely what it means.
                             (noticing)
                        And I can’t believe you’re peeing 
                        like that.

                                 DECKER
                        Why?  ‘Cause it’s illegal?

                                 ETHAN
                        No.  Because you’re getting it on 
                        your suitcase.

           Decker realizes his pee is in fact rolling on a slope back 
           down into his Rolls Royce bag.

                                 DECKER
                        The Rolls-mobile!  Damn it.

           INT. MIAMI HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

           There is a long line of over A HUNDRED CHILDREN waiting with 
           their parents to get head shots taken by a PHOTOGRAPHER.  A 
           Lloyd Gervin TEAM MEMBER mans a card table, checking in all 
           the kids getting head shots.  Steven and Beth enter with 
           Kingsley, who is in a tuxedo.

                                 STEVEN
                             (in disbelief)
                        All these kids have a meeting with 
                        Lloyd Gervin?  I thought this was 
                        something special for Kingsley.

                        It’s just nerves, Sweetheart.  
                        You’re fine.
                             (to team member)
                        Is this the line to get head-shots?

                                 TEAM MEMBER
                        Yes.  That’ll be two hundred 
                        dollars, please.

                                 STEVEN
                        We already paid the woman out 
                        front.

                                 TEAM MEMBER
                        That was the entrance fee.  This is 
                        the head-shot fee.

                                 STEVEN
                        Another two hundred dollars?

                                 BETH
                        You’re so cheap -- Just pay him.  
                             (to team member)
                        I saw a sign that said call backs 
                        were tomorrow.  What does our son 
                        have to do to get a call back?

                                 TEAM MEMBER
                        Just buy a head-shot.

                                 BETH
                             (to Steven)
                        Hurry -- Get a call back!

           Annoyed, Steven gets out his wallet to pay again.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        I have to make a pooey!

                                 BETH
                        In a minute, King-King.  We don’t 
                        want to lose our place.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Now!!!  The pooey’s coming!
           EXT. VIRGINIA COUNTRY-SIDE ROAD - DAY

           Decker and Ethan trudge along the side of the road.  They are 
           drenched.  Decker is in the middle of a story.

                                 DECKER
                        ...And then her dad walked in and 
                        caught me in bed with her.  Let’s 
                        just say the old man was not happy -
                        - And when I say old, he was 
                        ancient.  Like a hundred.  Hell, 
                        she was seventy-five.

                                 ETHAN
                        What is with you and nasty women?

                                 DECKER
                        Who said she was nasty?

                                 ETHAN
                        You did it with a seventy-five-year-
                        old.

                                 DECKER
                        Truth be told, she just gave me a 
                        hand job.  And it wasn’t even good.  
                        Her arthritis was acting up. 

           Ethan thinks for a beat.

                                 ETHAN
                        So, you don’t always do it every 
                        time you go to bed with a girl?

           Decker scoffs.

                                 DECKER
                        Pfft!  No.  
                             (then, covering)
                        I mean, don’t get me wrong, most of 
                        the time I drill ‘em.  Like nine 
                        out of ten times there’s drillage.  
                        But sometimes women worry you’ll 
                        lose respect for them if they do it 
                        right away.  Other times you’re 
                        just too lit, so it’s a non-
                        starter.  And then other times, as 
                        much as you want to do it, and as 
                        good as sex feels, putting your 
                        head down on a cold pillow and just 
                        going to sleep feels even better.

           Ethan thinks about this and nods, understanding.
                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        But usually I drill ‘em.  Good 
                        question.

           THE SOUND OF A CAR approaching.  Decker and Ethan turn to see 
           it getting closer.  Decker holds out his thumb for a ride.

                                 ETHAN
                        What are you doing?

           The car slows to a stop ahead of them.  A friendly man in his 
           thirties, JERRY, is driving.  He waves Decker over as Ethan 
           tries to catch up.

                                 DECKER
                             (to Ethan)
                        Come on!

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m not getting in that car.  He 
                        could have a gun.

                                 DECKER
                        He doesn’t have a gun.

           Decker approaches the car.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (to Jerry)
                        Hey, there!

                                 JERRY
                        Hop in.  Let me just move my gun.

           Jerry lifts AN OLD RIFLE off the passenger seat.

           INT. / EXT. CAR - DAY

           Decker and a nervous Ethan slide into the back seat where 
           they are surprised to find themselves next to a woman -- 
           Jerry’s wife, LINDA.  Jerry passes her the gun.

                                 JERRY
                             (re: old rifle)
                        Hold this, Mother.

                                 LINDA
                        I thought you said I wasn’t allowed 
                        to use the gun.

                                 JERRY
                        You’re not using it, you’re holding 
                        it.  Now get in the front seat.
                                 LINDA
                        I thought you said I wasn’t allowed 
                        in the front seat.

                                 JERRY
                        Just move!

           Linda climbs over the seat as Decker and a very concerned 
           Ethan get settled in.  They notice Jerry and Linda are 
           WEARING PERIOD CLOTHES FROM THE 1800’S.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Where you boys headed?

                                 DECKER
                        The nearest town where we can rent 
                        a car would be fabulous.  How ‘bout 
                        you folks?

           Jerry starts driving.

                                 JERRY
                        Headin’ to Gettysburg to fight them 
                        Yellow Hammers and Goober Grabbers.  
                        General Lee has his troops on the 
                        move, pushing up from Virginia.  
                        Word is we need all the boys we can 
                        muster to defend an attack on 
                        Northern soil.

           Ethan looks at Jerry like he’s crazy.  

                                 DECKER
                        Hey, you’re re-enactors.

                                 JERRY
                        We try to stay in character for a 
                        truly authentic Civil War 
                        experience.

                                 DECKER
                        That’s pretty much as cool as it 
                        gets without actually being cool.

                                 LINDA
                             (offering food)
                        Would you boys like some hardtack 
                        or a whole pound of salt beef?

           Linda holds up NASTY FOOD WRAPPED IN OLD CLOTH.  It looks 
           horrible to Ethan, and he’s surprised when Decker takes some.
                                 DECKER
                             (getting into character)
                        Much obliged, ma’am.

           Linda offers the food to Ethan.

                                 ETHAN
                        Absolutely not.  I don’t even want 
                        to look at it.

                                 DECKER
                             (to Linda and Jerry, re: 
                              Ethan)
                        I apologize.  He hasn’t had an 
                        appetite since we fought down in 
                        Chancellorsville.

           Jerry and Linda light-up with excitement as Decker has 
           effortlessly joined in their re-enactment game.  Ethan, 
           however, is looking at Decker like he’s lost his mind.

                                 JERRY
                        Hear that?  Our friends fought in 
                        the Battle of Chancellorsville.

                                 LINDA
                        You brave souls.

                                 DECKER
                        The Union took many losses.  
                        General Lee outsmarted us with a 
                        daring move whereby he divided his 
                        army in two, and General Hooker 
                        played right into his hands.  We 
                        were lucky to escape with our 
                        lives.  Right, Ethan?

           Ethan stares at Decker.

                                 ETHAN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DECKER
                             (ignoring Ethan)
                        Mark my words, General Hooker is 
                        going to be replaced with Major 
                        General George Gordon Meade of 
                        Pennsylvania.  You heard it here 
                        first.

           Jerry and Linda can hardly contain themselves.
                                 JERRY
                             (breaking character)
                        Hot damn, you’re good!  You all are 
                        coming with us to Gettysburg.

           Decker laughs, flattered.

                                 DECKER
                        Maybe another time.  We have to get 
                        my friend here to his mom’s.  He’s 
                        sailing across the Atlantic to 
                        London Towne.

           Jerry and Linda share a look.  Jerry’s hand subtly LOCKS ALL 
           OF THE CAR’S DOORS.  Ethan and Decker look at each other 
           quizzically.  And did Linda just aim the gun slightly more 
           toward them in the back-seat of the car?

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           -- Jerry and Linda’s car cruises along.

           -- A sign reads “PENNSYLVANIA WELCOMES YOU!”

           -- Ethan stares out his window with a “get me out of here” 
           expression, as if we are in a car next to him.

           INT. / EXT. MOVING CAR - DAY

           Decker cranes his neck to try to see an approaching exit.

                                 DECKER
                        I think this exit here looks good 
                        for us...  Yeah, coming up here...  
                        Here.  Right here-- There it goes.

           The car continues past the exit.

                                 JERRY
                        Shoot, I’ll get the next one.  I 
                        couldn’t get over.

           AERIAL SHOT 

           We can see their car is the only one on the road.

           LATER

           From an aerial view we see the car approaching another exit.
                                 DECKER (V.O.)
                        Yeah, this looks good.  Just get 
                        off here... 

                       ETHAN (V.O.)
                                                      DECKER (V.O.)
           Right here.  Right here.
                                              Get off, get off get off!

           They pass the exit.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                             (more bad lying)
                        Oh!  That one snuck up on me out of 
                        nowhere.  Next one, boys.  Promise.

           INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

           The car is approaching yet another exit.  Decker and Ethan 
           are slumped down in the back seat.

                                 DECKER
                             (to Jerry, defeated)
                        I don’t know about you, but 
                        personally, I find it hard to exit 
                        from the far left lane...

           They pass the exit with nary a move to even get over.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Good try, though.

           INT. MIAMI HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

           Beth and an annoyed Steven watch as Kingsley is finally 
           getting his head shots taken.  He is making crazy faces and 
           refusing to cooperate with the PHOTOGRAPHER.  The exhausted 
           photographer, however, has taken so many photos of kids he is 
           barely paying attention.

                        Look this way...

           Kingsley purposely looks the other way.  The photographer 
           takes a shot.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Good...

                                 BETH
                        Smile, Kingsley, like we practiced.
                             (to Steven)
                        Tell him to smile!
                                 STEVEN
                             (half-hearted)
                        Smile.

           Kingsley snarls as another picture is taken.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Work it.  Good...

           Steven looks on, shaking his head in disappointment.  His 
           attention goes to a sign that reads --

           “LLOYD GERVIN’S TALENT SEARCH.  CALLBACKS TOMORROW.  EVERYONE 
           WELCOME!”

                                 STEVEN
                        What am I doing here?  I should 
                        have taken Ethan to school.

                                 BETH
                             (to Kingsley)
                        Really big smile!

           The photographer takes the final picture as Kingsley isn’t 
           even facing the camera.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        That was the winner -- next!

           INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

           Decker and Ethan continue to ride in the back of Jerry’s car, 
           when his LOW FUEL LIGHT comes on.

                                 JERRY
                             (re: his car)
                        Damn it.  We need to fill up the 
                        horse with more feed.

           Ethan rolls his eyes, visibly annoyed.  Decker notices they 
           are about to pass an exit.

                                 DECKER
                        It says there’s gas at this exi--

           Decker and Ethan get tossed to one side of the car as Jerry 
           instantly swerves across three lanes and gets off. 

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Look who found the steering wheel.
           EXT. MOVING CAR - DAY

           A quaint Pennsylvania town with a single Main Street.  
           Jerry’s car pulls into a gas-station.  Out of the farthest 
           reaches of Hurricane Kendra, the weather is now CLEAR AND 
           BEAUTIFUL. 

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Jerry is at the pump, filling his car up.  He’s twirling his 
           CAR KEYS on his finger as he looks up at the gas prices.

                                 JERRY
                             (to himself)
                        The price of hay around here is not 
                        cheap...

           INSIDE THE CAR --

           Decker and Ethan watch Jerry from the back seat.

                                 ETHAN
                        You always hear how kidnapping 
                        victims wind up loving their 
                        captors.  Well, I can confidently 
                        say our captors are two of the most 
                        annoying people I’ve ever been 
                        around.  I couldn’t hate them more.

                                 DECKER
                        We’re not kidnapped.  We’ve been 
                        “drafted.”  And don’t worry, I 
                        won’t let anything happen to you.  
                        At least we’re heading north.
                             (watching Jerry)
                        We just have to figure out how to 
                        get away from them.

                                 ETHAN
                        Why’d you have to go and encourage 
                        them, anyway?  Now they’re obsessed 
                        with you.  It’s creepy.  And how do 
                        you know so much about the Civil 
                        War?

                                 DECKER
                        I got my masters in U.S. history.
                             (looking at Jerry)
                        If we could just get his keys...

           Ethan is incredulous.
                                 ETHAN
                        You have a masters degree and 
                        you’re a flight attendant?

                                 DECKER
                        The only thing I can do with that 
                        degree is teach.  What job do you 
                        expect me to have?

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t know -- teacher?

                                 DECKER
                        Kids are needy and annoying.  I 
                        hate kids.  You of all people 
                        should know that.

                                 ETHAN
                        Then why get the degree?

                                 DECKER
                        It was a good way to stay in school 
                        and keep drilling for hot college 
                        oil.

                                 ETHAN
                        You’re so weird.

           Behind Jerry, Linda exits the Mobile Mart eating from a LARGE 
           BAG OF DORITOS.

                                 DECKER
                        Here comes Linda.  
                             (noticing chips)
                        I didn’t know they ate Cool Ranch 
                        Doritos during the Civil War.

           Jerry turns from pumping gas and also notices Linda with the 
           chips.  He’s not happy about it.

                                 JERRY
                        Hey!  What the hell is that!

                                 LINDA
                             (mouth full of chips)
                        Sorry, Jerry, but that food taste 
                        like shit.

           Ethan and Decker watch as Jerry proceeds to chase after her, 
           attempting to take the bag.  For her part, Linda tries to 
           stuff all the chips in her mouth before he can take it away.

           CLOSE ON
           Jerry has left his CAR KEYS sitting on the trunk of his car.

           PULL BACK 

           Ethan and Decker are eyeing the keys through the rear 
           windshield.

                                 DECKER
                        Bingo.

           Decker readies himself to exit the rear car door.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        Get in the driver’s seat, I’ll get 
                        the keys.  Just be ready to pull 
                        out of here.

                                 ETHAN
                        Me?  I can’t drive. 

                                 DECKER
                        Why?  You’re almost sixteen.

                                 ETHAN
                        I just turned fourteen.  I’m almost 
                        thirteen.

                                 DECKER
                        Just do it.

           A reluctant Ethan climbs into the driver’s seat.

           As Jerry and Linda continue to fight over the Doritos...

           Decker slips out the back car door... Takes the gas pump out 
           of the car, grabs the keys from off the trunk, jumps back in, 
           and hands the keys to Ethan. 

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Go!  Go!

           Ethan takes the keys and starts the car.

                                 ETHAN
                             (to Decker, re: car)
                        What do I do?

           Decker leans over into the front seat and throws the gear 
           shift down from “PARK” to “DRIVE.”

                                 DECKER
                        Press the gas.
           Ethan looks down and presses the accelerator and the car 
           takes off...

           Ethan looks up to drive...

           Just as a PICK-UP TRUCK HAULING A HORSE TRAILER PULLS IN to 
           the previously empty pump directly in front of them.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (seeing the truck)
                        Stop!

           Eyes wide, Ethan jams on the brakes, SCREECHING to a halt, 
           just as their front bumper lightly knocks into the pick-up 
           truck’s front bumper.

           Decker slides forward, slamming into the back of the front 
           seat.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh, God...

           The doors to the pick-up fly open and out hop TWO REDNECKS, 
           who approach Ethan and Decker.  They are both wearing 
           CONFEDERATE SOLDIER UNIFORMS.

                                 REDNECK #1
                             (calling to Ethan)
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 DECKER
                        Great.  Confederate soldiers.

                                 REDNECK #1
                        We’re headin’ up to Gettysburg to 
                        kick some Union ass, mindin’ our 
                        owns, when slam!  Do you even know 
                        how to drive?

           Redneck #1 is now at Ethan’s window.  He glares into the car, 
           pissed off.  Ethan is terrified.

                                 ETHAN
                        Uh...

                                 DECKER
                             (to Ethan)
                        Don’t worry.  He’s not going to 
                        hurt a kid.
                             (to rednecks)
                        Let’s just save it for the 
                        battlefield, okay, fellas...
           Decker gets out of the car and looks up to see Redneck #1 is 
           already DRAGGING ETHAN FROM THE CAR, through the window.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Whoa!  Whoa!

           Redneck #1 drops Ethan on his feet and punches him in the 
           stomach.  Ethan doubles over and falls to the ground out of 
           breath.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?  He’s just a 
                        kid.

           Decker goes to Ethan and kneels down to tend to him.

                                 REDNECK #1
                        Where I come from, there’s a 
                        sayin’... you old enough to drive, 
                        you old enough to get kicked in 
                        your starfish.

           Decker looks up, confused.

                                 DECKER
                        That’s really a saying?

           Redneck #1 kicks Decker hard in the ribs.  Decker falls over 
           with a grunt.

                                 REDNECK #1
                        Are you questionin’ my verbal 
                        heritage?

           SMACK!  Redneck #1 gets hits across the head with a baton-
           type stick.  

           PULL BACK

           It’s Jerry wielding a dripping WINDSHIELD WASHER.

                                 JERRY
                        Keep your hands off my soldiers, 
                        Confederate swine!

           Redneck #2 instantly tackles Jerry, and proceeds to beat him 
           down quickly and effortlessly. 

           Linda comes over desperately stuffing the remnants of chips 
           into her mouth.

                                 LINDA
                             (mouth full)
                        Get off him, you asshole.
           Redneck #1 simply shoves Linda, sending her falling over a 
           trash can and behind a gas pump. 

           Jerry lies on the ground.  The two rednecks look down at him.

                                 JERRY
                             (in pain)
                        But the South... isn’t supposed to 
                        win.

                                 REDNECK #1
                        Looks like we’re rewriting history, 
                        bitches!

           EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Decker and Ethan wheel their bags over to where Linda is 
           tending to Jerry, who is still on the ground.

                                 DECKER
                             (awkward)
                        So, yeah, uh, we’re going to go 
                        now.  You guys okay?

                                 LINDA
                        Yeah.
                             (re: rednecks)
                        Assholes.

                                 ETHAN
                             (whispering)
                        Is it me, or is it weird that 
                        they’re just... right there?

           WIDE SHOT

           The two rednecks are three feet away, casually filling up 
           their truck with gas and scratching lotto cards, 
           respectively, as if nothing ever happened.

                                 DECKER
                        I guess you kick a bunch of 
                        people’s asses, you still have to 
                        live your life. 

           Jerry struggles to hand Decker a business card from his 
           wallet.

                        No hard feelings, boys.  If you’re 
                        ever passing through the nineteenth 
                        century and you want to give me a 
                        call, here’s my cell...

                        And if you’re on-line later, I’m 
                        going to be Tweeting live from the 
                        battlefield.  I usually die at 
                        about five o’clock.

           INT. UNITED CAR RENTAL AGENCY - DAY

           A small branch of a rental car chain.  Decker and Ethan enter 
           and approach DEVON, 30’s, a nerdy clerk behind the counter.  
           Devon has just been fitted for ADULT BRACES.  Throughout the 
           scene HE ABSENTLY RAISES AND LOWERS HIS LIPS over them, as if 
           they are irritated.

                                 DECKER
                        Hi.  We’d like to rent a Ferrari.

                                 DEVON
                        We have a PT Cruiser, or the 
                        equivalent.

                                 DECKER
                        I’m cool with that.
                             (to Ethan)
                        You cool with that?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.  With the wood.  

                                 DEVON
                        Excellent.  I’ll just need a valid 
                        driver’s license and credit card.

                                 DECKER
                        I’m driving.  
                             (re: Ethan)
                        Miss Daisy here will be paying.

           Decker gives Devon his driver’s license and Ethan’s credit 
           card.  As Devon types information into his computer, Ethan 
           and Decker watch DEVON MOVING HIS LIPS UP AND DOWN OVER HIS 
           BRACES.  They are transfixed.

                                 DEVON
                        Excellent... 
                             (to Ethan)
                        Would you like to purchase our  
                        additional insurance?

                                 ETHAN
                        What?  Oh, uh...

           It’s clear Ethan doesn’t know what that means.
                                 DECKER
                        You don’t want the insurance.

                                 ETHAN
                        Really?

                                 DECKER
                        You don’t want it.  Trust me.

                                 ETHAN
                        My dad always gets it.  

                                 DECKER
                        It’s a sucker’s play.  Like the VIP 
                        room at a strip club.  Throwing 
                        good money after bad when all you 
                        have to do is walk into the 
                        bathroom and jerk off for free.

           Ethan is undecided.

                                 ETHAN
                             (to Devon)
                        Would you get the insurance?

                                 DEVON
                        I would get the insurance, yes.

                                 DECKER
                        Of course he would.  He’s trying to 
                        sell it to you.

           Ethan is still unsure.  Finally --

                                 ETHAN
                        Okay.  No insurance.

                                 DEVON
                             (looking at computer)
                        So no collision damage waiver?  No 
                        loss damage waiver, physical damage 
                        waiver...?

                                 DECKER
                             (shaking head, annoyed)
                        No, no, no.  

                                 DEVON
                        Excellent!  Now, you said a PT 
                        Cruiser, or the equivalent... 
                             (re: computer screen)
                        I’m sorry, we don’t have any at 
                        this time.  Second choice?
                                 ETHAN
                        A convertible.

                                 DEVON
                             (re: computer screen)
                        Hmm...  Seem to be out of those, 
                        too.  

                                 DECKER
                        Let’s try it this way: what do you 
                        have?

                                 DEVON
                             (re: computer)
                        I’m afraid we are all out of cars.  
                        Is there anything else I can help 
                        you with at this time?

           Devon smiles a big, friendly, metal smile as Decker and Ethan 
           stand there staring at him, at a loss.  

           THROUGH THE RENTAL OFFICE’S LARGE WINDOWS --

           There is a DING as someone returning a MINIVAN drives onto 
           the lot. 

                                 DEVON (CONT’D)
                        Correction.  We have a minivan.

           EXT. UNITED CAR RENTAL AGENCY PARKING LOT - DAY

           The driver returning the minivan is a shady-looking Armenian 
           man in a white suit, VERNER.  Verner is unloading LARGE 
           COOLERS and large (three feet long) Tupperware-style 
           containers from the rental minivan and placing them into a 
           WAITING CAR.  The waiting car is driven by another shady-
           looking OVERWEIGHT MAN in a tank-top.  Decker approaches. 

                                 DECKER
                        We’re kind of in a hurry, fellas. 
                             (re: cargo)
                        Let me give you a hand with those 
                        bins...

                                 VERNER
                        Get the hell away.  

                                 DECKER
                        Whoa --

                                 VERNER
                        The hell away.  Right now.  Or I 
                        cut you.
                                 DECKER
                        Cut me?  Jesus.  All right...

           Decker lets them have their space and walks back, shaking his 
           head.  He approaches Ethan, who is finishing the rental 
           paperwork with Devon.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        He just said he was going to cut 
                        me.

                                 ETHAN
                        Who?

                                 DECKER
                        That guy.  When was the last time 
                        you heard someone say they’re going 
                        to cut you?  Do people even do that 
                        anymore?

           Ethan shrugs, trying to concentrate on Devon’s instructions.

                                 DEVON
                        ...Initial here and here.  And then 
                        sign here.

           Ethan signs his name.

           VERNER --

           calls to them.  He’s done.

                                 VERNER
                        All right, my friends.  The car is 
                        yours.  Love and blessings!   

           Verner jumps into the passenger side of the waiting car and 
           they take off like they are being chased.

                                 DECKER
                        “Love and blessings?”  Suddenly 
                        he’s my best friend.  People are 
                        nuts.

           Finished with the paperwork, Devon tears a copy for Ethan.

                                 DEVON
                             (re: minivan)
                        Okay, let me just get her cleaned 
                        up, and you can be on your way.

                                 DECKER
                        No time for that, Crazy Lips.
           Decker and Ethan walk to the minivan and toss their luggage 
           inside.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        We’re on a clock.  T-minus five 
                        thousand dollars and counting.

                                 DEVON
                        I don’t know what that means.

           Decker starts up the minivan and drops his sunglasses down 
           over his eyes.  With a devilish grin --  

                                 DECKER
                        It means almost one mortgage 
                        payment on my condo!  

           Decker punches it and awkwardly PEELS OUT in the front-wheel 
           drive minivan as though it were a sports car.  The car 
           swerves, nearly hitting a pole by the exit.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (trying to regain control)
                        Whoa -- shit.

           INT. / EXT. MOVING MINIVAN - DUSK

           Decker and Ethan drive very slowly along the main street of 
           this quaint town due to all the traffic lights and 
           pedestrians.

                                 DECKER
                             (re: the car’s GPS)
                        According to this, we should be at 
                        your mom’s by ten.

           Decker rubs where he was kicked in the ribs and winces.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        How are you feeling?  You okay?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.

                                 DECKER
                        I’m proud of you.  You fought like 
                        a lion back there.  We both did.  
                        Ever been punched before?

                                 ETHAN
                        My little brother.  He’s my half-
                        brother.  He’s always hitting me.
                                 DECKER
                        Oh, I bet he regrets that.  You 
                        bring the thunder like you did back 
                        there at the gas station?

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m not allowed to touch him.

                                 DECKER
                        Your little brother hits you and 
                        you don’t do anything about it?  
                        Oh, no.  No --

                                 ETHAN
                        I can’t.  He has health problems.  
                        He was born premature and his heart 
                        didn’t develop right.  So he gets 
                        pampered.

                                 DECKER
                        He sounds like an asshole.

                                 ETHAN
                        He is.

                                 DECKER
                        The best thing you could do for 
                        that kid is beat the shit out of 
                        him.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, but his heart could give out.

                                 DECKER
                        It’d be good for him.  What doesn’t 
                        kill you only makes you stronger.

                                 ETHAN
                        But it could kill him.

                                 DECKER
                        Still...

           INT. UNITED CAR RENTAL AGENCY - DAY

           Devon, the clerk behind the counter, is looking at his 
           computer.  THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Verner’s associate’s car 
           SPEED BACK ONTO THE PARKING LOT and SCREECH to a stop.  Devon 
           turns to the noise and watches as Verner jumps out of the car 
           and runs inside the rental car agency.
                                 VERNER
                        The minivan we just had!  Where is 
                        it?

                                 DEVON
                        Rented, I’m afraid.  Did we forget 
                        our favorite mix CD?

           Verner grabs Devon by the shirt and pulls him close.

                                 VERNER
                        Something very valuable and 
                        dangerous is in that car.  Get it 
                        back or I melt down that metal 
                        while it’s still in your mouth.   

           Devon covers his teeth with his lips, protectively, in a big, 
           equine-like move.

           INT. / EXT. MOVING MINIVAN - DAY

           Decker and Ethan continue driving along the main street, but 
           it’s slow going.

                                 DECKER
                        ...I wouldn’t say it’s required.  
                        But it’s customary to tip the 
                        bathroom attendant a buck.  And you 
                        get a piece of chewing gum.  Talk 
                        about a racket -- Bathroom 
                        attendant.  That’s gotta be the 
                        easiest job in town.     

           Ethan takes in this valuable information.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        What do you want to be when you 
                        grow up?  And don’t say bathroom 
                        attendant or I’ll feel very stupid.

           Ethan shrugs.

                                 ETHAN
                        I think something with music.

                                 DECKER
                        You like music?  Music’s cool.  It 
                        sounds nice.

                                 ETHAN
                        What about you?
                                 DECKER
                        Shit, man, I am grown up.

           Ethan gives Decker a dubious look.

                                 ETHAN
                        Okay, if you could do anything with 
                        your life, what would you do?

                                 DECKER
                        Like a realistic job?  Not any 
                        fantasy crap like being an 
                        astronaut or a fireman?

                                 ETHAN
                        You can be a fireman.

                                 DECKER
                        Huh.  I guess I could.
                             (then, answering question)
                        I don’t know what I’d do.  Pretty 
                        sad, huh?

                                 ETHAN
                        I think you should be a history 
                        teacher.

                                 DECKER
                        I told you, I hate kids.  You --

                                 ETHAN
                        ...of all people should know that.   
                        Believe me, I do.

           Ethan shakes his head.  Decker smiles.  Ethan can’t help but 
           smile, too.

                                 DECKER
                        Whatever I do, I got to make some 
                        cash.  The five thousand I’m 
                        getting for this is a real life 
                        saver.

           Ethan looks guilty at the mention of their “deal.”

           DEVON --

           speeds up behind them in his old Mazda Miata and HONKS, 
           trying to get their attention.  

           Decker and Ethan finally notice him.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        What the hell...?
                                 ETHAN
                        It’s the guy from the rental place.

                                 DEVON
                             (calling out)
                        Pull over! 

           Decker lowers his window.

                                 DECKER
                             (yelling back to Devon)
                        We told you!  We don’t want the 
                        insurance!

           Devon continues to HONK and YELL out his window.

                                 DEVON
                        Pull!  Over!

                                 DECKER
                        But we don’t want it!  Stop 
                        bothering us!

           Decker raises his window back up and shakes his head.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Man, they really give the hard sell 
                        on that.

           Decker accelerates through a light as it’s changing and they 
           get away from Devon, who is forced to stop.

           CLOSE ON --

           A MOUSE scurries along the minivan’s floor.  We follow it as 
           it crawls ONTO DECKER’S SHOE and UP INSIDE HIS PANTS LEG.  
           Decker shakes his leg out with a little shiver.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (re: feeling on his leg)
                        Eww-ahh...

           After a beat, Decker shakes out his leg again, a little 
           harder this time.  Then, after a long beat, he breaks into a 
           sudden panic.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        Holy shit, there’s something in my 
                        pants!  Dude!  There’s something in 
                        my pants!

                                 ETHAN
                        What is it?
           Decker comes to an abrupt stop at a traffic-light in front of 
           an outdoor cafe.  

           A FAMILY -- 

           sitting at one of the tables looks over at the minivan as it 
           SCREECHES to a halt.  They watch, mouths agape, as Decker 
           looks down at his crotch and yells at Ethan.

                                 DECKER
                        Take it out!  Take it out!  It’s in 
                        my pants!  

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m not touching that -- It’s 
                        moving.

                                 DECKER
                        Grab it!  Smash it!  Choke it -- I 
                        don’t care, just make it come out!

           Decker is now pounding on his own crotch.  He writhes in 
           discomfort, but to the family watching it appears like he’s 
           in a strange state of sexual pleasure.

           Finally, Decker gets his pants unbuttoned, GRABS THE MOUSE, 
           AND TOSSES IT OUT HIS WINDOW.  A relieved Decker appears to 
           the family like he is sated.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit...  Oh, man...  That was 
                        wild.

           Decker drives on, leaving the family horrified.  Ethan is now 
           laughing.

                                 ETHAN
                        You should’ve seen your face.  

                                 DECKER
                        Shut up.  He snuck up on me.  Had 
                        the mouse presented himself to my 
                        face, like an honorable vermin, I 
                        would have kicked his ass.

                                 ETHAN
                        Uh-huh.  
                             (suddenly nervous)
                        You think there are any more?

           Ethan anxiously looks around his feet.
                                 DECKER
                        Nah.
                             (re: Verner)
                        So that’s what that weird dude must 
                        have had in all those bins -- lab 
                        mice.  I hope it wasn’t radioactive 
                        and now my penis starts fighting 
                        crime...

           Continuing to look around, Ethan sees A KING COBRA SNAKE RISE 
           UP behind Decker’s right shoulder, hunting the mouse.

                                 ETHAN
                             (barely audible)
                        Snay...  Snay-hake.

                                 DECKER
                        Maybe I do hope that.  It’s a job, 
                        right?

           Decker casually looks to Ethan and catches a glimpse of the 
           snake out of the corner of his eye.  He quickly turns to it 
           and SCREAMS...

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        AHHHHHHH!!!

           ...and drives the minivan straight INTO THE BACK OF A PARKED 
           CAR.

           The snake goes flying forward, slams against the windshield, 
           and then lands on the STEERING WHEEL.  Decker looks at it, 
           less than two feet from his face.  He is frozen with fear.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t.  Move.  

           But the AIRBAG GOES OFF from the impact, lifting the snake up 
           and pressing it against Decker’s face, check-to-cheek.  
           Decker SCREAMS again.

           EXT. STREET - DUSK

           A TOW-TRUCK --

           is lifting the SMASHED MINIVAN up onto its flat-bed.  

           DECKER AND ETHAN --

           are with Devon, who is looking over their RENTAL AGREEMENT.
                                 DEVON
                             (wincing)
                        Eww... it says here you chose not 
                        to take the insurance.  That’s 
                        unfortunate.

           Ethan glares at Decker.  Decker glares at Devon.

           EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

           A quaint, turn of the century hotel on the town’s Main 
           Street.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Decker and Ethan drag their bags into a suite.  They are in 
           mid-argument.

                                 DECKER
                        You need to call your dad and find 
                        out if your credit card covers the 
                        accident.

                                 ETHAN
                        You’re not listening to me.  We 
                        have to figure out a way to get to 
                        my mom’s tonight.  It’s a mistake 
                        to spend the night in this hotel.

                                 DECKER
                        Dude, how many times do I have to 
                        tell you?  I checked, and there’s 
                        no way out of this town until we 
                        can rent a new car in the morning.

                                 ETHAN
                        But --

                                 DECKER
                        I promise you we’ll make it to your 
                        mom’s in time.  Just call your dad.

                                 ETHAN
                        I can’t call my dad.

           Ethan puts his head in his hands, freaking out.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        This was such a mistake.  I never 
                        should have left the airport.
                                 DECKER
                        Look, I know you’re worried about 
                        him getting mad at you, but he’ll 
                        understand.  All you have to say is 
                        I was attacked by a King Cobra and 
                        he’ll be like okay, I get that.  No 
                        more questions. 

                                 ETHAN
                        That’s not it.  

                                 DECKER
                        Then what?

                                 ETHAN
                        He doesn’t know about this.  

                                 DECKER
                        Of course he doesn’t, it just 
                        happened.  That’s why you have to 
                        call him --

                                 ETHAN
                        He doesn’t know about us.  He 
                        thinks I’m spending the night at 
                        the airport on my way to boarding 
                        school in New Hampshire.

           Decker is confused.

                                 DECKER
                        Boarding school?  What about your 
                        mom?  What about my five thousand 
                        dollars?  

                                 ETHAN
                        There was no five thousand dollars.

           Decker is crushed.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        I made it up because... I don’t 
                        want to go to boarding school.

                                 DECKER
                        You lied to me?

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sorry, Decker.  I 
                        really am.  I thought if we got to 
                        my mom’s maybe she could pay you.

           Decker feels like a fool.
                                 DECKER
                        I suggest you call her, or your 
                        dad, or whoever and tell them to 
                        come pick you up because I’m done.  
                        In the morning I’m taking off and 
                        you’re on your own.

           Decker exits into the bathroom, slamming the door.

           MUSIC CUE: “L.E.S. ARTISTES” BY SANTOGOLD PLAYS OVER THE 
           FOLLOWING:

           -- Ethan knocks on the bathroom door in an attempt to get 
           Decker to speak to him.  After a beat, the door opens and 
           Decker is in a BATHING SUIT.  He walks past Ethan without 
           talking to him and exits the hotel suite.

           -- The CAMERA IS UNDERWATER in a pool.  We see Decker enter 
           frame as he jumps in.  WE CUT TO: above the water and reveal 
           Decker has jumped into a kiddie pool only two feet deep.  The 
           nearby large pool is empty with a “Remodel in Progress” sign 
           by it.  Ethan approaches Decker to try to talk to him.  
           Decker gets out of the kiddie pool and exits, leaving Ethan.  
           A LITTLE KID jumps into the kiddie pool and Ethan is 
           splashed.

           -- In the hotel game room, Decker is playing ping-pong with 
           ANOTHER LITTLE KID.  He violently slams the ball in the kid’s 
           face to win the game.  The kid exits the table making room 
           for the next player, who happens to be Ethan.  Decker sees 
           it’s him, drops his paddle and walks away.  Another KID takes 
           Decker’s place and serves to Ethan, who watches Decker go.

           -- Decker is relaxing in the hotel sauna with a few other MEN 
           IN TOWELS when Ethan enters, in his suit and tie.  He sits 
           down next to Decker, who notices Ethan and gets up to exit.  
           We see Decker is BUCK NAKED with only a towel over his 
           shoulder.  As he pulls the door open to leave, A MAN happens 
           to be entering and Decker steps aside to allow him in.  In 
           doing so, Decker inadvertently positions his bare ass in the 
           face of ANOTHER MAN seated by the door.  That man shoves 
           Decker, pissed off.  Decker tries to calm him down before 
           finally exiting.  The remaining men are looking at a 
           frustrated Ethan, fully dressed, sitting on the sauna bench.  
           The CAMERA SLOWLY PUSHES IN on him as he starts to sweat, 
           wondering what he is going to do now.

           END MUSIC CUE.

           INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Decker is in line to be seated for dinner.  Ethan is behind 
           him in a fresh suit.  
           Decker won’t look at Ethan or talk to him.  A HOSTESS returns 
           from seating other patrons and approaches them.

                                 HOSTESS
                        How many?

                                 DECKER
                             (pointedly)
                        Table for one.

           Ethan rolls his eyes.

                                 HOSTESS
                             (to Ethan)
                        How many?

                                 DECKER
                        Don’t trust him.  He’ll lie to you.

                                 ETHAN
                        One.

                                 DECKER
                             (to hostess)
                        Ha!  See?  He’s less than one.  
                        Make him sit on the floor.  

                                 HOSTESS
                        I only have a four-top open.  It’s 
                        going to be a few minutes.

           An attractive woman in her mid-thirties, LISA, gets in line 
           behind Decker and Ethan.  The hostess looks to her.

                                 HOSTESS (CONT’D)
                        How many?

                                 LISA
                        Two, please.

                                 HOSTESS
                        We only have a four-top and you’re 
                        behind these two.

           Lisa smiles at Decker, clearly attracted to him.

                                 LISA
                        You know, we’re happy to sit with 
                        you and your son, if you want.

                                 DECKER
                        Ha.  He’s not my son.
                                 LISA
                        Oh.  I thought you two were 
                        together.  Sorry.

           As Decker sulks, Ethan sees a way back into Decker’s good 
           graces.

                                 ETHAN
                             (to Lisa)
                        We are.  We’re together.

           Decker looks at Ethan, wondering what he’s doing.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        He’s just a little mad at me right 
                        now.  We’d love to join you, right 
                        Dad?

                                 DECKER
                             (petulant)
                        No, we wouldn’t.  No.

           Ethan urges Decker with his eyes -- This woman is pretty. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Dad?

                                 DECKER
                             (to Ethan)
                        No.  Make me.
                             (to Lisa, explaining)
                        It’s nothing against you.  It’s 
                        him.  I shant break bread with him 
                        again.

                                 ETHAN
                        Come on.  I said I’m sorry.

                                 LISA
                        Yeah, Dad.  Have a heart.  I’m 
                        starving.  
                             (then)
                        I’ll buy you a drink.

                                 DECKER
                             (quickly to the hostess)
                        Table for four.  Please.  Thank 
                        you.
                             (to Lisa)
                        I’m only doing this for you.  I 
                        hate to deprive anyone the pleasure 
                        of watching me drink.
                             (to Ethan)
                        You can’t watch me.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                             (then, to Lisa)
                        So are we waiting on your friend, 
                        or...?

           Lisa’s fifteen-year-old daughter, KENDRA, bounces in to join 
           her mom.  She is extremely cute and bubbly.

                                 KENDRA
                             (re: Ethan and Decker)
                        Ma?  I leave you alone for two 
                        minutes...

           Kendra laughs a playful, infectious laugh.  A surprised Ethan 
           instantly stiffens at the sight of a hot girl his age.

                                 KENDRA (CONT’D)
                             (introducing herself)
                        Hi!  I’m Kendra.  Hi!  Kendra.

                                 ETHAN
                             (almost to himself)
                        Like the hurricane.

                                 KENDRA
                        Ohmigod -- crazy, right?  I always 
                        knew I’d be famous.

           She mock primps her hair like an old pin-up model as she 
           laughs again.  Ethan is instantly smitten.

           INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Decker, Ethan, Lisa, and Kendra are having dinner together.  
           Decker is back to himself, having fun.  The mood is lively 
           and friendly except Ethan, who is nervous and stiff.  A 
           WAITER approaches their table with a tray of drinks.

                                 WAITER
                        Jack on the rocks?

                                 DECKER
                        Right here.  Thank you.  That’s 
                        lovely.

                                 WAITER
                        Long Island Iced Tea?

                                 LISA
                             (lifting hand)
                        Me.

                                 WAITER
                        Diet coke.
                                 KENDRA
                        Moi.  Merci.

           The waiter puts the last drink in front of Ethan.

                                 WAITER
                        And Shirley Temple.

           Decker glares a major look of disappointment at Ethan.

                                 LISA
                        I love Shirley Temples.

                                 KENDRA
                        Me, too.  Can I have a sip?

           Suddenly, Decker isn’t so disappointed.  He offers a nod of 
           encouragement to Ethan.

                                 ETHAN
                        Uh... okay.

           Kendra takes it and makes a point to drink from Ethan’s 
           straw, the whole time looking at him with a flirty smile.

                                 KENDRA
                        Yum!  That is so good.
                             (to Lisa)
                        Can I have a sip of yours, too, Ma?

                                 LISA
                        Just a little one.  You have a big 
                        day tomorrow.

           Lisa slides her Long Island Iced Tea to Kendra.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                             (explaining)
                        Kendra is in a baton twirling 
                        competition.  Twirl Mania. 

                                 DECKER
                        That’s fabulous.  Ethan and I are 
                        huge fans of Twirl Mania.  Isn’t 
                        that right, E?

           Decker looks to Ethan, but Ethan is captivated by Kendra 
           CHUGGING LISA’S ENTIRE COCKTAIL.

                                 LISA
                             (realizing)
                        Kendra -- I said a little one.
                                 KENDRA
                             (wiping her mouth)
                        It was all ice.

           Decker immediately slides his cocktail over to Ethan and 
           gestures for him to quickly take a sip.  Ethan vigorously 
           shakes his head, and mouths, “It’s illegal.”  Decker mouths 
           “DRINK IT!” as he pushes the drink into Ethan’s hand.  Kendra 
           and Lisa are now looking at them.

                                 DECKER
                             (re: drink, explaining)
                        I said he couldn’t have a sip but 
                        now it’s only fair, so go ahead...

           Ethan is on the spot in front of the women.  He takes a gulp 
           and starts coughing.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Decker and Lisa are drunk and dancing together, twisting and 
           twirling to UPBEAT JAZZ PIANO.  

           Next to them, Kendra is having fun in her own world, grinding 
           and writhing alone.  

           Other HOTEL GUESTS are also dancing.  

           And in the corner, we reveal the TALENTED PIANIST IS ETHAN.  
           He is buzzed and sweaty, his suit-jacket is off, and his tie 
           is loosened.

                                 LISA
                        Your son is awesome.  How long has 
                        he been playing?

                                 DECKER
                        Uhh... fifteen years.  Yeah.

                                 LISA
                        Fifteen?  How old is he?

                                 DECKER
                        Fourteen.  Can I be honest with 
                        you?  He’s not really my son.  I’m 
                        a heterosexual flight attendant 
                        escorting him to his mom’s in 
                        Albany. 

                                 LISA
                        Ugh, I hate Albany.
                                 DECKER
                        Me, too!

           They resume dancing together, and Decker spins her out of 
           frame.

           Ethan is really good, and the people in the lounge are loving 
           it.  He finishes the song he’s playing, and everyone CLAPS.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Sing something!

                                 KENDRA
                        Yeah!  Free Bird!  Whoo-hoo!

                                 ETHAN
                             (into the microphone)
                        Okay.  Well, I don’t know Free 
                        Bird.  
                             (thinking)
                        Um...  Okay.  

           Ethan starts playing the jazz standard, “Moonlight in 
           Vermont.”

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                             (singing)
                        Pennies in a stream... Falling 
                        leaves a sycamore... Moonlight in 
                        Vermont...

           Ethan’s VOICE IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL and we reveal everyone in 
           the room is cringing at him in awkward disbelief.  But for 
           the first time, the self-conscious Ethan is too in his own 
           world to notice.  Decker quickly approaches him.

                                 DECKER
                             (stopping Ethan)
                        Buddy.  Buddy.  Come on, now.  
                        That’s enough of that.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The four of them are back in Ethan and Decker’s suite for 
           more partying.  

           POP MUSIC is playing on an IPOD BOOM-BOX as Kendra is 
           PERFORMING HER BATON TWIRLING ROUTINE for them.  But the 
           ceiling in the hotel room is so low that each time she throws 
           the baton high in the air to spin around to catch it, the 
           baton immediately hits the ceiling and ricochets down toward 
           Decker, Ethan, or a lamp-shade.  
           Undeterred, the low ceiling doesn’t stop an enthusiastic 
           Kendra from picking up her baton and completing her entire 
           routine.  Decker leans over to Ethan as they watch her -- 

                                 DECKER
                        Are you kidding me with this girl?  
                        She’s too wonderful for words.

           Ethan is mesmerized by her body’s every movement.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        Now I really think you have a shot 
                        here.  All those years of 
                        practicing alone in the shower have 
                        prepared you for this moment.  Have 
                        you been practicing in the shower?

           Ethan nods.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        You’re ready for this.  You can do 
                        it.  Make your move and be 
                        confident.  Are you confident?

           Ethan looks like he might cry.  He sighs anxiously with a 
           forced smile.  

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.

                                 DECKER
                        You sold me.

           Decker pats an unsure Ethan on the back, when there is a 
           KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

           A WAITER wheels in a room service cart with A CAKE on it, 
           complete with BURNING CANDLES.  The waiter, Decker, Lisa, and 
           Kendra begin to sing to Ethan.

                                 WAITER / DECKER / LISA / KENDRA
                        Happy birthday to you... Happy 
                        birthday to you... Happy birthday 
                        dear Ethan... Happy birthday to 
                        you...

           The waiter exits.  Ethan can’t believe it.

                                 ETHAN
                        How did you know?

                                 KENDRA
                        How did he know?  He’s your 
                        freakin’ dad.
                                 LISA
                        Oh -- no.  He’s not his dad.

           Kendra is confused.

                                 DECKER
                        Your paperwork on the plane had a 
                        note about it being your birthday.  
                        I was supposed to bring you a 
                        cupcake, but I ate it.

           Lisa playfully hits Decker.

                                 LISA
                        That’s terrible.

           But Ethan is genuinely touched.

                                 ETHAN
                        Thanks.

                                 DECKER
                        Go ahead.  Make a wish.

           Ethan closes his eyes, makes a wish, and blows out the 
           candles.  They CLAP for him.  Kendra goes to him...

                                 KENDRA
                        Happy birthday.

           ...and gives Ethan a real kiss right on his lips.

                                 DECKER
                             (re: Kendra’s kiss)
                        I’m telling you right now that was 
                        what he wished for.

           They all laugh.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                             (to Ethan)
                        It was, wasn’t it?  Am I right?  
                        Look at him.  I am so right. 

           Ethan tries to play it cool but can’t fool anyone.  

           LATER

           Finished with their cake, Decker, buzzed, has his arm around 
           Lisa.  He leans in close to her.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (whispering in her ear)
                        Hey.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        What do you say you and I go to 
                        your room and take turns making me 
                        feel good?

           Lisa laughs.

                                 LISA
                        Okay.  You first.

                                 DECKER
                        Ha!
                             (to Ethan and Kendra)
                        Listen, kids, Lisa and I are going 
                        to take a little walk.  Behave 
                        yourselves while we’re gone, okay?

           Lisa gives her daughter a kiss and whispers something to her 
           we can’t hear.  Decker looks at Ethan seriously and gives him 
           an encouraging nod.  Decker and Lisa exit into the hallway.  

           Now that it’s just Ethan sitting alone with Kendra, he gets 
           noticeably awkward and Kendra senses it.

                                 KENDRA
                             (re: Ethan’s suit)
                        I really like your style, Ethan.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh.

                                 KENDRA
                        Yeah.  The suit’s cool...
                             (looks around room, then)
                        And this suite is bitchin’.

                                 ETHAN
                        I got my dad’s credit card, so I 
                        just put the room on it.  If you 
                        want me to buy you something, I 
                        can.

           She laughs at his awkward but sweet gesture.

                                 KENDRA
                        Thanks.  Your dad is super cool.

                                 ETHAN
                        I’ve never heard anyone describe 
                        him as “cool.”

                                 KENDRA
                        Really?  Ohmigod, he seems super 
                        fun to me.
           Ethan realizes she’s talking about Decker.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh -- Decker, yeah.  I guess he has 
                        a certain charm.

           There is another awkward beat of silence.

                                 KENDRA
                        Don’t you want to come sit over 
                        here next to me?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.

           But Ethan doesn’t move.  He’s a deer in the headlights.

                                 KENDRA
                        Well, come here then, silly.

           Ethan gets up from his chair and joins Kendra on the couch.  
           She takes his hand and holds it, playing with it, looking 
           into his eyes with a smile.  She is clearly waiting for him 
           to kiss her, but Ethan is too scared to do anything.  

                                 KENDRA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t want to kiss me?

                                 ETHAN
                             (laughs nervously)
                        Why wouldn’t I want to kiss you?

                                 KENDRA
                        I don’t know.  
                             (then)
                        What are you waiting for?

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t know.

           Ethan again laughs nervously.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t...

           His face falls serious as he slowly, tentatively, ever so 
           hesitantly goes in for a kiss.  As soon as his lips touch 
           Kendra’s she attacks him, pushing him onto his back, and 
           makes out with him.  She finally comes up for air and looks 
           down at Ethan.

                                 KENDRA
                        You want me to twirl your baton?
           Ethan’s eyes widen.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

           Ethan is awakened by the sound of his phone RINGING.  He sits 
           up and realizes he’s alone on the couch, still in his suit 
           from the previous night.  He looks at the ringing phone and 
           sees it’s his dad, Steven.  Ethan hits “DECLINE.”   

           INT. WILDER FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Steven gets Ethan’s now familiar OUTGOING MESSAGE again.

                                 ETHAN (V.O.)
                             (sighs, then dour)
                        Leave me a message...

           Steven waits for the BEEP.

                                 STEVEN
                             (into phone)
                        Hey, checking in before your 
                        flight.  I hope the airline’s baby-
                        sitter was okay and you weren’t too 
                        bored last night.  Oh, and don’t 
                        worry about being late for school.  
                        They said Kendra was really 
                        screwing a lot of kids.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan stretches and notices A HANDWRITTEN NOTE on some hotel 
           stationery.  He reads it, and then puts it in his pocket with 
           a smile.  He then gets up and looks around the hotel suite.

                                 ETHAN
                        Decker?  Decker?

           Ethan disappears into the bedroom.  

                                 ETHAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You in here?  Hello?

           Ethan reappears.  There is no trace of Decker, no clothes, no 
           suitcase.  It seems as though, despite their great night, 
           Decker has left just as he threatened he would.  Ethan sits 
           down on the couch, suddenly lost and scared.
           A CARD-KEY is inserted into the hotel room door and it opens.  
           Decker enters and Ethan quickly stands up, visibly relieved.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        There you are.  I thought you left.

                                 DECKER
                        I got coffee and bagels.

           Decker hands over a bag and a coffee to Ethan.

                                 ETHAN
                             (for not leaving)
                        Thanks, Decker.

                                 DECKER
                        Yeah, man.  I took ten bucks out of 
                        your wallet.

           Decker hands Ethan some change.  They sit around the coffee 
           table and eat together.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        So...?  What happened with Kendra 
                        last night?  You shlam-bang her?

                                 ETHAN
                             (embarrassed)
                        No.

                                 DECKER
                        No shlam-bangery?  She blow out 
                        your candle for your birthday?

                                 ETHAN
                        No.
                             (then)
                        Why?  Is that supposed to happen?

                                 DECKER
                        It’s sort of a rule, yeah.  But you 
                        kissed her and stuff?

           Ethan tries to play it cool.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah. 

                                 DECKER
                        Yeah?  Good for you.

                                 ETHAN
                        And a little more.
           Decker is surprised.

                                 DECKER
                        No shit?  A little heavy pet-age?  
                        You animal.

           Decker considers Ethan and can’t help but smile.    

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Look at you.

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 DECKER
                        You got in a fight, you drove a 
                        car, you got laid.  Not bad.

                                 ETHAN
                        I didn’t get laid.

                                 DECKER
                        Yeah, but nobody knows that.  You 
                        always tell people you closed the 
                        deal -- always.  Even if you 
                        didn’t.  It creates an aura about 
                        you that women pick up on.

                                 ETHAN
                        Did you close the deal with 
                        Kendra’s mom?

                                 DECKER
                        Who, Lisa?  Oh, yeah.  We hit for 
                        the cycle.  We went around the 
                        horn.

           Ethan considers Decker, dubious.

                             (coming clean)
                        We just kissed a little.

                                 ETHAN
                        You mean I did more than you?

           Decker rolls his eyes.  Ethan is clearly proud of himself.

                                 DECKER
                        We actually talked until the sun 
                        came up.  It was nice.  Hey, you 
                        know Lisa and I were born in the 
                        same hospital one day apart?

                        She doesn’t remember me, but still.  
                        Pretty crazy.

                                 ETHAN
                        That reminds me.

           Ethan takes out THE NOTE that he found when he woke up.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Kendra asked me to give you her 
                        mom’s number.

           Ethan tears the note in half, keeping a portion of it for 
           himself, and offering the other half to Decker.

                                 DECKER
                        Cool.

           Decker takes the piece of paper, casually crumples it up, and 
           tosses it in a nearby trash can.  Ethan is confused.

                                 ETHAN
                        What are you doing?

                                 DECKER
                        What’s the point?

                                 ETHAN
                        You just said you liked her.

                                 DECKER
                        Yeah, so?

                                 ETHAN
                        So?  She seems significantly better 
                        than the other women I’ve seen you 
                        interested in.

           Decker chuckles.

                                 DECKER
                        You get laid and suddenly you’re an 
                        expert.

           Decker is finished with his food.  He wipes his hands.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        All right, my man.  I better hit 
                        the road.  It’s been interesting.

           Decker gets up.  Ethan is confused.

                                 ETHAN
                        You’re leaving?
                                 DECKER
                        Yeah.  I have to get back to Jersey 
                        and figure out my life.

                                 ETHAN
                        Why?

                                 DECKER
                        Why?  I need a job.  I need a 
                        purpose.  And my dog has to be 
                        clenching his butt cheeks so tight 
                        his tail’s popped off.

           Ethan is clearly disappointed.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Someone coming to get you?

                                 ETHAN
                        Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  My dad said I 
                        didn’t have to go to boarding 
                        school if I didn’t want to, so...

                                 DECKER
                        Good.  That’s what you wanted.   
                        All right, then...

           Decker holds out his hand.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for flying Sunshine 
                        Express.  See you on the runway.  

           They shake hands, as Ethan looks concerned about what he’s 
           going to do now that Decker is leaving.

           Steven is getting a cup of coffee as he talks on his phone.
                                 STEVEN
                        That depends on what you’re about 
                        to tell me. 

                                 LEORA
                        Well it seems there’s been quite a 
                        bit of inconsistent charges on one 
                        of your cards, and as a precaution 
                        we want to confirm some recent 
                        activity.  First off, do you know 
                        anything about a seventeen thousand 
                        dollar charge at United Car Rental 
                        in Flintsburgh, Pennsylvania? 

           Steven is stunned.

                        What?!

           INT. UNITED CAR RENTAL AGENCY - DAY

           Decker is renting another car.  He gives his credit card to 
           Devon.

                                 DEVON
                        Excellent!
                             (by rote)
                        Would you like to purchase our 
                        additional insurance?

                                 DECKER
                        Ha.  That’s funny.

           EXT. UNITED CAR RENTAL AGENCY PARKING LOT - DAY

           Devon is on his hands and knees looking under the rear seat 
           of a mid-size sedan.  A nervous Decker watches from a safe 
           distance.

                                 DECKER
                        No snakes, lizards, Gila monsters,

                        any of that shit in this car, you 
                        hear me?
                             (then)
                        So how do you like renting cars?  I 
                        bet you can meet a lot of women.

                                 DEVON
                        Women and men.  I’d say I have a 
                        random sexual encounter on average 
                        three to four times a week.

           Ethan is at the ticket window buying a bus ticket.  A CLERK 
           has swiped Ethan’s credit card.

                                 CLERK
                             (re: credit card)
                        I’ll try it again, but it says 
                        declined.

           Ethan waits anxiously as the clerk swipes the card again.

                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        This card is canceled.

                                 ETHAN
                        Canceled?  But I have to get to 
                        Albany.

                                 CLERK
                        How about you walk away and I won’t 
                        call the cops. 

                                 ETHAN
                        You think I stole that card?  My 
                        father gave me that.

                                 CLERK
                        Well then call your father.

           A clerk indicates a phone.  Ethan looks at it and then scoffs 
           in frustration.

                                 ETHAN
                        That’s my card.

                                 CLERK
                        Get outta here.

           INT. WILDER FAMILY HOME - DAY

           Beth is holding up three of Kingsley’s outfits on hangers for 
           Steven’s opinion.

                                 STEVEN
                        I can’t talk about this right now.
                                 BETH
                        Just tell me -- what do you think 
                        for call-backs?  Rapper with hat 
                        turned sideways?  Train conductor 
                        with hat turned backwards?  Or 
                        jockey with soft helmet, not 
                        turned?

           Steven is bemused.

                                 STEVEN
                        Beth -- I’m sitting here worried 
                        something’s happened to Ethan.  
                        He’s not answering his phone, his 
                        credit card has been stolen, and 
                        you’re asking me if I want Kingsley 
                        to look like a lawn jockey?

                                 BETH
                        A lawn Jockey?  Nice.  This is the 
                        biggest day of our son’s life and 
                        you’re worried about Ethan -- who 
                        I’m sure left his card somewhere in 
                        the airport and is now on the plane 
                        not answering his phone.  Pick an 
                        outfit. 

                                 STEVEN
                        I’m tired of you always calling the 
                        shots.

                                 BETH
                        Pick an outfit.

           Steven backs down and relents, as usual.

                                 STEVEN
                        The conductor.

                                 BETH
                        Ugh, that’s the worst one.

           INT. MOVING RENTAL CAR - DAY

           Decker is cruising down the main highway out of town, singing 
           his ass off to ALL I REALLY WANT, by Alanis Morissette, which 
           is playing on the car’s radio.

                                 DECKER
                             (singing)
                        There I go jumping before the 
                        gunshot has gone off...
           Decker mimes shooting a pistol.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                             (singing)
                        Slap me with a splintered ruler...

           Decker mimes slapping himself.

                             (singing)
                        And it would knock me to the floor 
                        if I wasn't there already.  If only 
                        I could hunt the hunter...

           Decker mimes pulling an arrow from a quiver and shooting it 
           with an imaginary bow.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        And all I really want...  is some 
                        patience...  A way to calm the 
                        angry voice...

           Decker’s singing trails off as he squints at someone 
           HITCHHIKING on the side of the road.  Decker looks closer as 
           he approaches the hitchhiker.  He drives past and sees the 
           HITCHHIKER IS ETHAN.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan, holding out his thumb, sees a car JAM ON IT’S BRAKES 
           and SCREECH to a stop fifty yards past him.  He grabs his bag 
           and takes off running for the car.

           Ethan approaches the car’s open passenger window and leans 
           his head in.

                                 ETHAN
                        Thanks for stopping.

                                 DECKER
                        Hey, don’t you know it’s illegal to 
                        hitchhike? 

           Ethan is surprised to see it’s Decker.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh.

           Ethan’s embarrassed.

                                 DECKER
                        What are you doing out here?
           Ethan doesn’t answer.  A car HONKS as it passes.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t call your dad, did you?

                                 ETHAN
                        Why would I call him?  If he cared 
                        about me he wouldn’t have sent me 
                        away.  

           Decker considers this.  Another car drives past, slowing down 
           and HONKING.  The PASSENGER YELLS something out her window at 
           them, but it’s hard to make out what she’s saying.

                                 DECKER
                             (waving the car on)
                        We don’t need any help!  Thank you!
                             (to Ethan)
                        Suddenly the world is so into 
                        helping.  Where were they when I 
                        was on the side of the road making 
                        out with a woman who turned out to 
                        have a penis in her pants?  No one 
                        seemed too interested in helping me 
                        then, and I needed serious help.
                             (then)
                        So where are you going?

                                 ETHAN
                        I have three hours to get to Albany 
                        and catch my mom before she leaves 
                        for London.

                                 DECKER
                        Three hours, huh?

           Decker agonizes for a long beat.  He reluctantly caves.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Get in.

           Ethan smiles.

                                 ETHAN
                        Really?

                                 DECKER
                        Yes.  Before I change my mind.
                             (then)
                        Wait!
                             (re: his suitcase)
                        Let me put the Rolls-mobile in the 
                        trunk.  Nobody sits on the Rolls.
           Decker checks for oncoming traffic before opening his car 
           door.  When it’s clear, he gets out and goes around to get 
           his suitcase off the passenger seat.

           Cars continue to HONK as they speed past.  ONE SWERVES away 
           from them at the last minute, coming dangerously close.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Whoa!  That car almost came onto 
                        the shoulder.

           Ethan takes a closer look at where they are on the road.

                                 ETHAN
                        Decker, I think this is the 
                        shoulder.

           Ethan points to the swath of grass he and Decker are standing 
           on next to the car.  Decker presses the key fob to open the 
           trunk. 

                                 DECKER
                        If that’s the shoulder then that 
                        would mean there are two lanes of 
                        traffic going in this direction...

           Decker considers the highway in front of them.

           As the trunk pops up, we hear the sound of a SEMI LAYING ON 
           ITS HORN.  The semi enters the frame and SLAMS INTO THE BACK 
           OF THE RENTAL CAR, pushing it quickly out of frame like a 
           snow plow shoveling snow.  A stunned Decker and Ethan are 
           left holding their bags.  After a beat, the car’s trunk lands 
           on the grass by them.  

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           We follow Decker and Ethan from behind as they walk along the 
           side of the highway, approaching a rest stop with gas 
           stations and restaurant chains.

                                 ETHAN
                        You took the insurance this time, 
                        right?  Decker --?

                                 DECKER
                        Don’t!  Don’t you ask me that.

           Ethan stops and looks at Decker, dumbfounded.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        It’s a scam, okay?
           EXT. REST STOP PARKING LOT - DAY

           Decker and Ethan pull their bags through the rest stop 
           parking lot when they pass a familiar sight in front of a 
           Denny’s restaurant.  Parked head-in is a LARGE PICK-UP TRUCK 
           WITH A HORSE TRAILER attached to the back of it.  There is a 
           tiny scuff on the glistening front bumper.  

                                 DECKER
                        Well, would you look at that...

           Eating inside at the booth by the window are the CONFEDERATE 
           SOLDIERS who beat up Decker and Ethan at the gas station.  
           The soldiers are clearly harassing a WAITRESS trying to take 
           their order.  Ethan is not happy to see them.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh, no.

                                 DECKER
                        I think we’ve found our ride.

                                 ETHAN
                        Are you crazy?  Those assholes?

           Decker looks at Ethan with a devilish grin.

                                 DECKER
                        Remember the story of Jack Jouett?

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. REST STOP PARKING LOT - DAY

           The doors to the horse trailer burst open and out ride Decker 
           and Ethan ON THE BACK OF TWO BEAUTIFUL HORSES.

                                 DECKER
                        Hyah!

           With their suitcases strapped to their saddles, they take off 
           over the parking lot and back down toward the highway’s 
           grassy shoulder.  They HOOT and HOLLER triumphantly as they 
           gallop off. 

           EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - DAY

           The two horses are now so exhausted they have stopped running 
           and can only walk slowly.  Decker and Ethan desperately try 
           to kick them to move.
                                 DECKER
                        Come on.  Hyah!  Hyah!

           But the horses don’t respond.

                                 ETHAN
                        Jack must have had a better horse.

           Their horses stop walking all together.

                                 DECKER
                        Okay, my guy’s dishes are done.

           It appears that Decker’s horse starts moving again.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        Wait, there I go.  
                             (realizing)
                        Oh, no.  That’s just yours going 
                        backwards.

           Ethan’s horse has, in fact, started walking backwards.

           Ethan and Decker look around and take in their surroundings.  
           They are adjacent to a vast farm with a quaint farm house set 
           back off the road.

           EXT. FARM - DAY

           WIDE SHOT

           Ethan and Decker are standing by their horses, talking with a 
           FARMER.  We can’t hear what they are saying but we see them 
           gesturing to the horses and see the farmer inspecting them.  
           Decker gestures, as if to say to the farmer, he can have the 
           horses if Decker and Ethan can have something off screen 
           behind a barn door.

           CLOSER

                                 FARMER
                        It’s my wife’s.  I’ll have to talk 
                        to her before I can let you take 
                        it.

                                 DECKER
                        Fair enough.

           The farmer leaves Decker and Ethan and heads into the farm 
           house.  Decker looks around. 
                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        You know I used to drive past this 
                        farm all the time on my way to 
                        visit my ex-girlfriend.  I’d get so 
                        excited because I knew that meant 
                        in one hour, I was going to see her 
                        again.  
                             (beat)
                        And then I’d masturbate into an 
                        empty fast food bag.

                                 ETHAN
                        Now that’s got to be illegal.
                             (then)
                        You wish you married her?

                                 DECKER
                        Who, Jenny?

           Decker thinks about it.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        Yeah.  I do.

                                 ETHAN
                        You’re up here.  Call her.  Tell 
                        her you regret dumping her.

           Decker shakes his head.

                                 DECKER
                        I didn’t dump her.  She dumped me.

                                 ETHAN
                        Well, yeah, because you wouldn’t 
                        marry her.

                                 DECKER
                        No.  Because I cheated on her.  

           Ethan looks at Decker.  He doesn’t understand.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        We were engaged, and one night I 
                        got really drunk, and I... I 
                        cheated on her.

                                 ETHAN
                        But you said...?

                                 DECKER
                        I guess we both lied. 

           Ethan takes in Decker’s confession.
                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        I told myself if I could do that to 
                        the person I loved more than 
                        anything, then I was just not going 
                        to be in a relationship again.  
                        ‘Cause if you’re not in a 
                        relationship you can’t cheat.  And 
                        if you can’t cheat, nobody’s heart 
                        gets broken.  So that’s why I got a 
                        hand-job from an arthritic seventy-
                        five-year-old.  Because there isn’t 
                        much chance of a relationship 
                        there.  And it’s also why I threw 
                        out Lisa’s phone number.

           The farmer exits the farm house and approaches them.

                                 FARMER
                        The wife said okay.

                                 DECKER
                        Beautiful!  You’re a good man, sir.

           Decker goes to shake the farmer’s hand.

                                 FARMER
                        Sorry, I’d shake your hand but my 
                        arthritis.

                                 DECKER
                        I know how that feels.

           MUSIC CUE:“ANOTHER TRAVELIN’ SONG” BY BRIGHT EYES PLAYS OVER:

           CLOSE ON

           The asphalt moving under us as we travel fast on an open 
           road.  The camera PANS UP to reveal the hood of a car.  It’s 
           the iconic hood of a ROLLS ROYCE.  As the camera continues to 
           PAN UP, we see it’s not a real Rolls Royce, but Decker’s 
           rolling suitcase being pulled behind a HOT PINK QUAD RUNNER 
           ATV.  Decker is driving the ATV, and Ethan is sitting behind 
           him, holding his luggage.

           VARIOUS SHOTS of Decker and Ethan cruising along different 
           roads.

           Decker and Ethan pull up to a red stop-light.  A BIKER on a 
           motorcycle is already there, waiting for the light to change.  
           Decker looks at him and gives his fellow rider a thumbs up.  
           The biker looks back at Decker and Ethan on the pink ATV and 
           gives them the finger, then speeds away.  Decker and Ethan 
           give the biker the finger back and slowly take off after him.

           INT. MIAMI HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

           A SIGN reads “YOU MADE IT!  LLOYD GERVIN’S TALENT SEARCH CALL-
           BACKS!”

           LLOYD GERVIN, slick, sits behind a mahogany desk on a Persian 
           rug talking to a FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL.  Her feet dangle off the 
           chair.

                                 LLOYD GERVIN
                        ...Emancipating from your parents 
                        is a decision only you can make.  
                        Sorry, time’s up.  
                             (giving her his card)
                        Call me, and I can help put this 
                        process in motion.

           Deep in a line ONE HUNDRED KIDS LONG, Steven, Beth, and 
           Kingsley wait their turn to meet with Lloyd, in the same way 
           a fan “meets” an author at a book-signing.  Kingsley is in 
           the rapper’s outfit.  Steven talks on his phone, upset.

                                 STEVEN
                             (into phone)
                        Because, the representative from 
                        his school said he never got off 
                        the plane.

           INTERCUT:

           INT. SUNSHINE EXPRESS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP sits at a cubicle talking to Steven.

                                 CUSTOMER SERVICE REP
                        Yes, I’m afraid we’ve lost your 
                        son.

                                 STEVEN
                        How can this happen?  Was anyone 
                        from your airline going to call me 
                        to let me know?

                                 CUSTOMER SERVICE REP
                        I’m sorry, Doctor, but this is a 
                        big airline and I assure you, your 
                        son isn’t the only child we’ve lost 
                        today.
                                 STEVEN
                        Is that supposed to make me feel 
                        better?

                                 CUSTOMER SERVICE REP
                        We’ll find him eventually, sir.  
                        But for your inconvenience, I’m 
                        going to go ahead and give you a 
                        free round-trip ticket to use 
                        absolutely anytime, no 
                        restrictions, however blackout 
                        dates do apply.  And you’re 
                        responsible for the tax.

                                 STEVEN
                        You’re responsible for my son!

           Steven hangs up, angry.  He looks at a placard on a stand.  
           The sign is like at an amusement park: “WAIT TIME FROM THIS 
           POINT: 1 HOUR!”  It has a cartoon likeness of Lloyd Gervin.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Come on.  We’re going.  

                                 BETH
                        No, we’re not.  We’re minutes away 
                        from Kingsley being discovered.

                                 STEVEN
                        I don’t care.  I have to find my 
                        son.

           Kingsley is PICKING BOOGERS from his nose and wiping them on 
           the back of an unsuspecting parent in front of him.  Steven 
           grabs Kingsley by the arm.

                                 STEVEN (CONT'D)
                        Let’s go, Kingsley.

                                 BETH
                        What do you think you’re doing?

                                 STEVEN
                        I’ve put up with your bullshit long 
                        enough.  It’s time we start acting 
                        like a normal family -- all of us. 
                        And that begins with getting the 
                        hell out of here.   

           With Kingsley in one hand, Steven takes Beth and leads them 
           out of the ballroom.  As they go --

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Suck my dick, Lloyd Gervin!
           The parents and kids in-line within earshot GASP at such 
           blasphemy.

                                 STEVEN
                        You said it, Buddy.

           EXT. ETHAN’S MOM’S HOUSE - DAY

           Decker and Ethan, on the ATV, pull into a long driveway that 
           leads up to a large modern house.  When they get to the 
           house, Decker shuts off the quad-runner.  Ethan removes his 
           helmet and hops off the back.  He runs up the steps to the 
           door of the house and RINGS THE BELL, excited.  After a beat, 
           his mother, Kate, approaches from the inside, and looks out 
           the glass window.  She opens the door, stunned to see her 
           son.

                                 KATE
                        Ethan?

                                 ETHAN
                        Hi, Mom.

           INT. STEVEN’S MOVING CAR - DAY

           Steven, Beth and Kingsley are driving home from the hotel.  
           Steven is talking on his phone.

                                 STEVEN
                             (into phone)
                        He’s where?
                             (then, relieved)
                        Thank God, he’s all right.

                                 BETH
                        I told you he was fine.  Can we 
                        turn around now?

                                 STEVEN
                             (snapping)
                        He’s not fine, Beth.  He’s at 
                        Kate’s house.  Now shut up for 
                        once!  Just shut up!  God!

           Beth rolls her eyes at the craziness.

                                 BETH
                        Mr. Tough Guy all the sudden.  
                        You’re the worst.

           INTERCUT:
           INT. ETHAN’S MOM’S HOUSE - SUN PORCH - DAY

           Ethan and Decker are sitting watching Ethan’s mom, Kate, pace 
           as she talks to Steven on her phone in the living room.

                                 KATE
                        Steven, I have a car coming in ten 
                        minutes to take me to the airport.  
                        I am unable to deal with this right 
                        now.

                                 STEVEN
                        You don’t have to deal with it, 
                        Kate.  Just like you’ve never had 
                        to deal with it.

                                 KATE
                        Don’t start with me.  I am not the 
                        one who conveniently sends our son 
                        off to boarding school when it 
                        seems pretty obvious he doesn’t 
                        want to go.

           Ethan watches his parents argue, sad.  Decker looks at him, 
           feeling awful for him.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Steven?  Steven?  Why don’t you 
                        tell that dumb bitch I can hear 
                        what she’s saying....

                                 DECKER
                        Sounds like my parents.
                             (then)
                        Come on.  I’ll take you to school.

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

           Decker stands up and Ethan looks at him.

                                 DECKER
                        You’re better off there, anyway.  
                        They have girls there?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.

                                 DECKER
                        What!  What!  You didn’t tell me 
                        there were girls there.
                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.

                                 DECKER
                        What!  You and a bunch of horny 
                        girls with no parents around?  Are 
                        you kidding me?  Do you realize 
                        you’re going to close the deal with 
                        every last girl in that school -- 
                        even the weirdos and ugly ones.  
                        You know why?  Because now you know 
                        how to land that shit!

           Ethan manages a smile.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        And you wanted to be here in Albany 
                        -- You’re crazy.  So what do you 
                        say?  You want to go?

           Ethan considers Decker’s proposition.  He looks at his mom 
           arguing with his dad -- she hits her phone on the counter in 
           frustration.  Ethan looks back to Decker and nods, yes.

           Decker approaches Kate, who continues to argue with Steven.  
           He tries to get her attention.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  We’re going to go.

                                 KATE
                             (into phone)
                        Oh, she thinks I’m fake when her 
                        tits would have made Isaac Newton 
                        reject his own theory of gravity.

                                 DECKER
                        We’re leaving.

                                 KATE
                             (covering phone)
                        What?

                                 DECKER
                        I got him.  I’m going to take him 
                        to school.  So don’t worry about 
                        it.  Go on your trip, or put 
                        yourself first, or whatever you 
                        people do.  I’ll make sure he gets 
                        to school. 

           Kate is confused.
                                 KATE
                             (into phone)
                        Steven, let me call you back.

           Kate hangs up.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        What do you think you’re doing?

                                 DECKER
                        I can’t sit here and watch everyone 
                        reject him anymore.  So I’ll just 
                        take him.  He’s a great kid and he 
                        doesn’t deserve this.  And you know 
                        what else?  He doesn’t need it.  
                        Because he’s a man now and he’s 
                        going to be just fine.

           Decker turns to see Ethan is behind him, having heard 
           everything he said. 

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Come on, buddy.  The Pink Lady’s 
                        waiting for us.  Let’s ride. 

           EXT. ETHAN’S MOM’S HOUSE - DAY

           Ethan and Decker walk out in the front driveway toward the 
           “Pink Lady” ATV when Ethan stops.  Decker notices and stops, 
           too.

                                 DECKER
                        What is it?

                                 ETHAN
                        Thanks, Decker.  You’re a good 
                        friend.

           Decker holds out his hand for Ethan to clasp.  Ethan takes 
           it, and Decker pulls him in for a hug.

                                 DECKER
                        B.F.F, right?  Big Fakers Forever?

           Ethan manages a smile.

                                 ETHAN
                        Big Fakers Forever.

           A LIMOUSINE has pulled up the driveway to where they are 
           standing.  The driver, RONNY, hops out of the stretch.
                                 RONNY
                        Hey, folks.  I’m Ronny, I’ll be 
                        your driver. 

           The driver grabs Ethan and Decker’s two suitcases by the ATV.

                                 RONNY (CONT’D)
                        These all your bags?

           Decker and Ethan look at each other.  They can’t believe 
           their luck.  Should they do it?  Ethan nods.

                                 DECKER
                             (to driver)
                        Yes, sir.  That’s everything.

           Ronny goes to put their bags in the limo.

           INT. MOVING LIMOUSINE - DAY

           Decker and Ethan are seated in the back, smiling.

                                 RONNY
                        What airline are you flying?

                                 DECKER
                        Actually, there’s been a change of 
                        plan, Ronny.  
                             (to Ethan)
                        Tell him where we’re going.

                                 ETHAN
                        Windsor Academy in Bedford, New 
                        Hampshire, please.

                                 RONNY
                        New Hampshire?  That’ll be quite a 
                        bit extra.

           Decker’s pouring himself a glass of scotch from the bar.

                                 DECKER
                        Just add it to the bill.  And throw 
                        in a generous tip for yourself.

                                 RONNY
                        Yes, sir.

           Decker looks up and sees Ethan holding out a tumbler for 
           himself.  Decker smiles.  He pours Ethan only a sip.
                                 DECKER
                        Just a drop.  I don’t want you to 
                        start singing again.

           Decker and Ethan clink glasses and sip their drinks in style.

           EXT. ETHAN’S MOM’S HOUSE - DAY

           Kate exits her front door with her luggage.  She looks out 
           into the driveway and it’s empty, save for the hot pink ATV.  
           She impatiently looks at her watch, clearly wondering where 
           her limo is.

           INT. / EXT. MOVING LIMOUSINE - DAY

           A few hours later, the limousine slowly makes its way up a 
           long, winding driveway in bucolic New Hampshire, passing an 
           ENTRANCE SIGN that reads: “WINDSOR ACADEMY FOR BOYS AND 
           GIRLS.”  Decker and Ethan have their faces pressed against 
           their windows, taking in the scene.

                                 DECKER
                        Holy shit, this is nice.

           They approach the front lawn of the school.  It’s a 
           beautiful, sunny New England day, and there are KIDS HANGING 
           OUT, throwing frisbees, talking under trees.

           A PRETTY CO-ED walks by and checks out in the limo.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        Look at that one.  Look at her.  
                        She’s checking you out.

                                 ETHAN
                        She can’t even see in here.  The 
                        windows are tinted.

           Decker rolls down Ethan’s window and calls to her.

                                 DECKER
                        Now she can.
                             (calling to co-ed)
                        Hey!  Hey, you.  Come here.

                                 ETHAN
                             (slightly anxious)
                        What are you doing, Decker?

                                 DECKER
                        Oh, you know what I’m doing.
           Ethan braces himself as the pretty co-ed approaches the limo.

                                 PRETTY CO-ED
                        Yeah?

                                 DECKER
                        I want you to meet someone very 
                        important.  This is Ethan.  He’s a 
                        bad ass.

                                 PRETTY CO-ED
                        Hi, Ethan.  I’m Anastasia.

           In previous moments like this, Ethan would have wilted.  But 
           not this time.

                                 ETHAN
                        Anastasia.  That’s a pretty name.  

                                 PRETTY CO-ED
                        Thanks.

           They share a smile.

                                 ETHAN
                        I’ll see you around.

           The limo slowly drives off and Decker is full of pride and 
           excitement for what is clearly a more confident Ethan.

                                 DECKER
                        Damn!  You just crushed that. 
                             (to the driver)
                        Ronny, did you just see how he 
                        crushed that?

                                 RONNY
                        Yes, sir.  It’s on.

                                 DECKER
                        Oh, it is so on.  You are shlam-
                        banging that girl tonight.  

           Decker playfully shoves Ethan, who tries to be cool, but 
           can’t help but laugh.

           The limo comes to a stop at the visitor parking lot in front 
           of the school’s main administrative building.

                                 RONNY
                        All right.  Windsor Academy.

           Ronny gets out and Ethan turns to Decker.
                                 ETHAN
                        So what are you going to do now?

                                 DECKER
                        I think I’m going to get a job 
                        renting cars.  I hear you can meet 
                        a ton of desperate women.  And, I’m 
                        very familiar with the rental 
                        insurance programs.

           Ethan pulls a CRUMBLED UP PIECE OF PAPER from his suit 
           pocket, and hands it to Decker.  

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 ETHAN
                        In case you’re ready for a real 
                        relationship again.

                                 DECKER
                             (looks at it)
                        You pulled Lisa’s number out of the 
                        trash.

                                 ETHAN
                        Well, someone once told me, people 
                        change.

           Decker ponders this and considers the paper in his hand.  

           Ronny opens Ethan’s door and Ethan gets out of the limo.  
           PASSING STUDENTS stare at him, checking him out.  Ethan takes 
           it in and then notices a familiar face.  He can’t believe it.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Dad?

           Steven is standing by a rental car.  Ethan is dumbfounded.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 STEVEN
                        I’ve come to take you home.

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 STEVEN
                        I know you don’t want to be here.  
                        So your step-mom and I talked it 
                        over and we want you to come home.  
                        I want you to come home.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVEN (CONT'D)
                        I screwed up, Ethan.  It took me a 
                        while to realize it, but I screwed 
                        up.  

           Steven tentatively goes to Ethan and then hugs him.  After a 
           moment, Ethan hugs his dad back.  They finally break and 
           Steven looks up to notice Decker standing nearby, watching.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Hi.  Steven.  

                                 DECKER
                        Gary.

           Ethan frowns, confused -- “Gary?”

                                 STEVEN
                        Thank you, Gary.

                                 DECKER
                        Please.  Call me Decker.

                                 STEVEN
                             (to Ethan)
                        So what do you say?  You want to 
                        come home?

           Ethan looks at his dad.  And Decker.  And the school and the 
           kids.

                                                     BLOW OUT TO WHITE.

           FADE IN:

           CLOSE ON

           A WHITE DRY ERASE BOARD.  A hand holding A MARKER comes into 
           frame and draws A NAKED WOMAN WITH BIG BOOBS.  We PULL BACK --  

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           -- as the ARTIST returns to his seat.  The CAMERA TRAVELS 
           through rows of TEENAGE BOYS AND GIRLS sitting down at their 
           desks, talking, sleeping, getting ready for class to begin.  
           As the camera moves past each kid we expect the next one to 
           be Ethan, but it never is.  Finally the camera ends up on --

           THE OPEN DOOR TO THE CLASSROOM --

           We hold on the doorway for a beat, waiting for someone to 
           come through it.  And finally, in walks DECKER.  
           He drops his shoulder bag down on the desk at the front of 
           class as he talks on his cell phone.

                                 DECKER
                             (into phone)
                        Why do we have to tour the 
                        hospital?

           INTERCUT:

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           Kendra’s mom, Lisa, is in the kitchen talking on her phone.  
           Lisa is NOTICEABLY PREGNANT.

                                 LISA
                        So we know what delivery there is 
                        going to be like.

                                 DECKER
                        We were born at that hospital, 
                        Lisa.  I don’t need to see it 
                        again.

                                 LISA
                        Well, I, for one, don’t remember 
                        much about that day.

                                 DECKER
                        I remember you.  It was the first 
                        time I saw you naked.  You were 
                        hot.  Look, I’m in class.  I’ll 
                        call you later....  Love you, too.

           Decker puts his phone away.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (to class)
                        All right.  Let’s get started here.

           The class quiets down as Decker notices the artwork on the 
           board.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Who did this?  Murph?  This your 
                        handy-work?

           A student, MURPH, shakes his head, no.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        Well, whoever did it, it’s 
                        inappropriate.  I love it, but it’s 
                        inappropriate.
           The class chuckles.  Decker erases it and starts writing on 
           the board, “THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.”

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                             (as he writes)
                        Anybody know the story of Jack 
                        Jouett...?

                                 STUDENT (O.S.)
                        Who?

                                 DECKER
                        Jack Jouett.

           We reveal the student asking the question is ETHAN.  He’s out 
           of his suit and dressed in the school’s casual uniform.

                                 ETHAN
                        What’s his name?

                                 DECKER
                        Jack Jouett.

                                 ETHAN
                        Jack who?

                                 DECKER
                        I swear to God, you ask me his name 
                        again and I will lock you in that 
                        bathroom over there.  You know I’ll 
                        do it. 

           Ethan smiles wryly.  Decker continues writing on the board.

                                 DECKER (CONT’D)
                        This is a story of an unlikely 
                        hero...

           And as Decker continues to lecture his class, we --

                                                              FADE OUT.

           THE END.
