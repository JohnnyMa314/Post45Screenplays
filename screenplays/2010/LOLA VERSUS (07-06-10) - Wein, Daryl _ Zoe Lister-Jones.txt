           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           LOLA (29), sharp with a tendency towards self-destruction, 
           bobs up and down in the middle of the deep sea. She is 
           surrounded by miles of blue. A gray sky looms overhead.

           She frantically searches for someone she cannot find. 
           Suddenly, a MAN’S HEAD breaks through the glassy surface, 
           starts swimming. She dashes, but he’s too fast, she cannot 
           reach him.  

           Magically, he climbs out of the water, and starts walking on 
           top of it. She is dumbfounded. 

           To her right, a broken, waterlogged RADIO floats by, playing 
           music. It drifts closer to her as she looks on, perplexed. 
           The music gets louder and louder as we cut to...

           INT. BEDROOM - NOLITA APARTMENT - MORNING

           The same RADIO on a bedside table, blinking green and red. 
           Lola awakens from her dream, turns off the alarm. A MAN lies 
           next to her, their bodies only moments ago heavily entwined. 

           She gazes at the back of his head longingly, kindly strokes 
           his hair with her hand. He is LUKE (30), confidence either 
           his greatest strength or most fatal flaw.

           He grabs his cell phone, checks his e-mail, gets out of bed. 
           Lola studies his back as he walks into the other room. 

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Music kicks in as Lola fastidiously makes the bed. Intercut 
           with the action are wide shots of concert-size LCD screens 
           flashing the opening credits in vibrant colors. 

           Lola tucks the sheets tightly and perfectly at the corners, 
           making sure not to leave any loose ends. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Lola brushes her teeth while looking in the mirror. She 
           notices a dirty smudge on the glass, wipes it off with a 
           tissue and water. 

           Her belly protrudes a bit under her night shirt. She sucks it 
           in. Turns the shower on.
           INT. SHOWER - MORNING

           Luke and Lola shower together. The space is tiny. He 
           retrieves shampoo for her, as she washes his body with soap. 
           He is artfully tattooed.

                                 LOLA
                        You gonna cut the toe nails anytime 
                        this century?

                                 LUKE
                        Nah, I’m into the monk look. It 
                        makes me feel more spiritually 
                        connected.

                                 LOLA
                        Yep. And there’s a reason why Monks 
                        never have sex.

                                 LUKE
                        Oh yeah?

           He shoves her head under the shower.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                           (in wrestler voice)
                        And the monks dominate!

                                 LOLA
                        Mercy! Mercy!

           He goes to kiss her and she spits a mouthful of water into 
           his face.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Lola, now dressed for the day, munches on a protein bar, pops 
           a BAGEL in the toaster oven and whips up an ESPRESSO for 
           Luke, delivers them both to him at the breakfast table. He is 
           still in his boxers and T-shirt. 

           He grabs her, kisses her all over.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Luke sips his coffee while reading The New Yorker. Lola eats 
           a yogurt while browsing the internet on her laptop. We catch 
           the headline of the BLOG she’s reading: THE BURNING BUSH - 
           Celebrities and Their Toxic Undergarments. Are you at risk?
           A picture pops up of MATT DAMON. We dive into her mind as 
           quick images flash across the screen of her having a long, 
           fulfilling relationship with him. 

           They laugh over a candlelit dinner together, get married at a 
           beautiful ceremony, walk on the beach, pack their kids up for 
           school. Then she snaps out of her daydream. Looks up at Luke 
           sitting across from her, wondrously.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - MORNING

           Luke and Lola walk down the street, hand in hand. New Yorkers 
           fly by on their way to work. A waifish GERMAN DESIGNER draped 
           in some sort of futuristic burlap cape walks past.

                                 LOLA
                        Really? That’s a look?

                                 LUKE
                        We’re old. We’re not caught up.

                                 LOLA
                        We’re caught up!

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           They approach the subway, look at a young couple, both 
           wearing Crocs, with a kid, wearing mini crocs. 

                                 LOLA
                        Oh cute family alert. It’s like we 
                        time traveled and had us a baby.

                                 LUKE
                        Minus the smurf shoes.

                                 LOLA
                        I wanna be a hot young mom.

                                 LUKE
                        We could probably make that happen.

           Lola sidles up to him, sexily.

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah?

                                 LUKE
                        Just gotta get you a boob job, a 
                        dye job, a real job...
                                 LOLA
                        I have a real job!

                                 LUKE
                        You go to school for a living!

                                 LOLA
                        Whatever. One day I’m gonna make a 
                        whole buncha money from my 
                        bestselling memoir: “Enough About 
                        Me, Let’s Talk About Me.”

           Luke laughs.

                                 LUKE
                        All right, I gotta get to work. 
                        Have a good day.

                                 LOLA
                        You, too, Monk.

                                 LUKE
                        I will cut you with my toe.

           He goes to kiss her on the lips, she pulls away kindly.

                                 LOLA
                        Lipstick.

           He backs off, unperturbed. She notices his collar is folded 
           wrong. She quickly adjusts it, to his chagrin. 

                                 LUKE
                        It’s fine, don’t worry about it.

                                 LOLA
                        No, I almost got it, hold on. 

           He looks embarrassed as people notice walking past. She 
           finishes straightening him out like a school boy. 

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Done. 

                                 LUKE
                        Thanks, bye.

                         LOLA
                                                      LUKE
           Love you.
                                          Love you.

                                 LOLA
                        You look very handsome today. 
                        (Yelling to the ether) He’s mine! 
           No one’s listening. He laughs, heads off.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Keep your cell on!

           But he’s already gone.

           INT. MEDITATION STUDIO - DAY

           Lola sits, legs folded, in a beautiful open space among a 
           number of WOMEN. A MEDITATION INSTRUCTOR leads a class in 
           breathing.

           Everyone has their eyes closed except Lola, who is 
           struggling. She keeps opening and closing them until the 
           teacher finally signals for her to keep them shut.

           INT. NYU - DEPT. OF COMPARATIVE LITERATURE- AFTERNOON

           Lola sits in a classroom among twelve fellow GRADUATE 
           STUDENTS. She is taking meticulous notes as the PROFESSOR 
           opens up a dialogue with the class.

           She looks up at the Professor, seeking his validation. He 
           smiles kindly, and nods.

           EXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING

           Luke waits for Lola outside school. He makes eyes with a few 
           beautiful women as they walk by, ponders an existence outside 
           of his relationship with them. Then, Lola appears, on one arm 
           her book bag, the other, Luke’s dry cleaning.

           They hug, kiss routinely, walk down the block hand in hand. 

           INT. BAR - EVENING

           Credits and music come to an end.

           Luke and Lola drink alone together, talking and laughing, as 
           the night wares on. This is a couple who still knows how to 
           have a good time, and it shows.

                                 LOLA
                        And I was thinking it ties in 
                        perfectly to my dissertation. What 
                        do you think?
                                 LUKE
                        You can’t write that, Alice will 
                        kill you.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh she doesn’t care, she wrote on 
                        Facebook yesterday she recites her 
                        Torah portion during sex.

                                 LUKE
                        That I didn’t need to know.

           The bartender delivers a plate of chicken wings. Luke starts 
           eating them.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my word these are good. You know 
                        what would make ‘em even better? If 
                        you ate one with me.

                                 LOLA
                        That’ll be a cold day in hell.

                                 LUKE
                        Or a hot one. Hot wing day in hell. 
                        So hot. Mouth is burning, it’s 
                        awesome. Okay, I’ll stop. 

                                 LOLA
                        How was your meeting at the gallery 
                        today?

                                 LUKE
                        Great. My solo show’s set for 
                        September. They loved the paintings 
                        of the celebrity sex tapes.

                                 LOLA
                        Amazing. What are you calling it?

           He scribbles the title on a napkin, holds it up. It reads: 
           “WHORE MOANS.”

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        You bastard, you stole my idea!

                                 LUKE
                        Borrowed. 

                                 LOLA
                        So you read it?
                                 LUKE
                        Just a few pages. It’s brilliant. 
                        Where does it go next?

                                 LOLA
                        Well, I’m trying to figure out how 
                        to connect the female moan during 
                        sex to the way she moans about 
                        everyday life when something is 
                        bothering her. 

                                 LUKE
                        I think I know a way to connect the 
                        two...

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lola moans loudly as Luke makes love to her. They fall back 
           onto the bed. Lola kisses him, heads to the bathroom as Luke 
           continues to heave.

           She comes back into the room in her pajamas, busies herself 
           in the corner of the room, digging through what appears to be 
           a heaping pile of junk.

                                 LUKE
                        What are you doing?

                                 LOLA
                        Honey, what’s in this pile?

                                 LUKE
                        Why must you clean after our 
                        lovemaking?

                                 LOLA
                        I feel invigorated.

                                 LUKE
                        Don’t worry about that stuff.

                                 LOLA
                        I feel like this is the opening 
                        sequence to an episode of Hoarders.

                                 LUKE
                        Just come over here.

           Lola gives it one more worried look, then slips into bed. 
           Luke is fiddling with something under the covers.
                                 LOLA
                        Are you trying to masturbate after 
                        we just had sex?

           He takes out a small, black box.

                                 LUKE
                        Lola. We’ve been together for eight 
                        years now. 

                                 LOLA
                        Oh my god.

                                 LUKE
                        You know I love you very much. I 
                        can’t imagine anything else. 

           She can’t believe it.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Will you marry me?

           He opens the ring box revealing a beautiful, modestly shaped 
           diamond. She looks up at him, confused and surprised...

           INT. NOLITA APARTMENT - DAY

           Lola sits at the kitchen table, going through papers, while 
           Luke paces on the phone. New haircuts show the passage of

                        Hold on, Raimundo? The icing is 
                        rice milk based, right?... No rice 
                        milk… NON GMO, NON GMO.

           His call waiting beeps.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, man, I gotta go, other line... 
                        Yeah Jesus loves you too, brother. 
                        (To Lola) It’s your mother tell her 
                        we’ve been planning this thing for 
                        eight months, we’ve got it under 
                        control. 
           She grabs the phone. He runs his hands through his hair, 
           stressed as all hell, starts pacing.

                                 LOLA
                        Honey, relax, go be with your 
                        crystals, I’ll take it.

           Luke sits on the couch, too overwhelmed to cope, lights up a 
           cigarette.  Lola clicks over, starts walking around.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Mom. Hi. No I know, but the issue 
                        is Grandma’s breath, it’s nasty. 
                        Either isolate her, or get her a 
                        mint.

           The door buzzes. Luke hops up, walks to the intercom and 
           presses a button.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        He’s good, but I gotta go, okay, 
                        Alice just got here, she’s helping 
                        with the menu, I’ll just see you 
                        tomorrow... Well, we don’t have the 
                        money for a caterer, and besides, 
                        it’s gonna be fun to make it 
                        ourselves, it’ll be like a pagan 
                        birthing ritual or something.

           Lola’s best friend, ALICE, 29, walks through the door. She is 
           diminutive, and fashion conscious, sometimes to the point of 
           hilarity. An Olsen twin without the charmed life. 

           Directly behind her comes Lola’s mother, KAREN, 58, a new age 
           ball buster, still talking on her cell phone.  This 
           definitely catches Lola by surprise. 

           Luke quickly puts out the cigarette, runs and hides.

                                 KAREN
                           (into phone)
                        Just don’t make fish, that’s no 
                        smell to welcome your husband with 
                        on his wedding night.

                                 LOLA
                        Incidentally, we’re standing face 
                        to face, so the phone is actually 
                        unnecessary.

           Karen keeps the phone to her ear, walks towards the bathroom. 
           Alice throws her hands up like “who knows.”

                                 KAREN
                        I knew if I told you, you wouldn’t 
                        let me come over to clean.

                        Honey, if Aunt Kathy is gonna be 
                        staying with you, the toilet bowl 
                        has to be spotless, you know her, 
                        she’s got a thing with the toilet 
                        bowls. 

                                 LOLA
                        I HUNG UP!

           Karen realizes she can hang up, too.

                                 KAREN
                        Oh. How do you turn this thing off?

           Alice takes the phone from her and presses “End”. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Alice. (To Lola) You 
                        have such good friends. 

           She shifts gears.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        I just want to help you with the 
                        wedding. We don’t have to agree on 
                        everything, but you can’t do 
                        everything yourself. The amount you 
                        pack into a day is unhuman. 

           Karen sniffs the air.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        What is that, burnt toast? Smoke, I 
                        smell it. A fire has burned here.

           Karen vanishes into the bathroom. Alice shakes her head. Luke 
           pops his head out from behind the door.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m gonna get some air.
           He waves to Alice, she waves back, he slips out.

                                 LOLA
                           (to Alice)
                        What’s up? You look like you’ve 
                        seen a ghost.

                                 ALICE
                        Look at this.

           Alice walks up to Lola, carrying a NEWSPAPER, slams it on the 
           table in front of her. Lola looks at the front page, reads 
           aloud.

                                 LOLA
                        “Conflict in Senate Could Get

                        Oh shit, wrong page.

           Alice frantically flips through the pages and then slams the 
           paper down again as she did moments ago. On the VOWS page, a 
           huge picture of a very attractive COUPLE in their late-
           twenties sits under the headline “Through Sickness and 
           Through Healthcare.”

           Lola stands in front of a mirror, her wedding dress plastered

           dress.

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        Can we come in?

           Lola snaps out of her fantasy.

                                 LOLA
                        Yep.

           Alice and HENRY, Lola’s male best friend, 28, cute and 
           decidedly menschy, walk in. Alice immediately bursts into 
           tears. Henry looks at Lola, taken with her beauty.

                                 HENRY
                        You look...amazing.
           Lola, stares at herself in the mirror, beaming with 
           excitement. 

                                 LOLA
                           (To Henry)
                        Don’t tell Luke you saw it.

           Henry reaches into his pocket for his phone, which is a super 
           old model.

                                 HENRY
                        Hold on, lemme tweet him.

                                 LOLA
                        You can’t even tweet on that phone.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, but the chicks love it. They 
                        think I listen more or something.

                                 ALICE
                        To what? Consumer Reports from 
                        1995? 

                                 HENRY
                           (to Lola)
                        Is it weird to you that I’m his 
                        best man?

                                 LOLA
                        No, why would it be weird? You’ve 
                        become really close with him over 
                        the years.

                                 HENRY
                        I know, it’s just you and I are 
                        best friends and we’ve known each 
                        other long before Luke-

                                 ALICE
                        Are you trying to take Maid of 
                        Honor from me, cause I’ve already 
                        ordered male strippers who get 
                        naked exclusively to the soundtrack 
                        of High School Musical.

                                 LOLA
                        Spoiler alert!

                                 HENRY
                        I feel like Rupert Everett.
                                 ALICE
                        Don’t we all.

                                 LOLA
                        Is there something you wanna tell 
                        me?

                                 HENRY
                        No, I love pussy. I just feel gay 
                        being here right now. 

           EXT. WEST VILLAGE - DAY

           Lola hurries down the street with her mother, Karen, and 
           father, LENNY, 60s, who lags behind, face buried in his 
           iPhone. 

                                 LENNY
                        I’m following the dot. The dot is 
                        moving all over the place.

                                 LOLA
                        Dad, it’s just on this next corner, 
                        you don’t have to use your iPhone.

           He takes out his iPad, starts navigating with that.

                                 LENNY
                        The iPad will get us there! 

                                 KAREN
                        He’s obsessed. It’s a sickness. He 
                        does the Scrabble on those damn 
                        things now with strangers in 
                        Milwaukee, serial killers, 
                        probably, he has no idea, but hey, 
                        when it’s virtual game night why do 
                        a background check?

                                 LENNY
                        I’m a retired man! Let me soar!

                                 LOLA
                        Okay, here we are.

                                 KAREN
                        Oh this place. This used to be a 
                        sex dungeon when we first moved 
                        here, remember Len? 
                                 LENNY
                           (on iPad)
                        Let me just search that...

           Off Lola and Karen rolling their eyes as Lenny clicks away. 
           They enter the doors of an extremely high end FLORIST. 

           INT. NOLITA APARTMENT- THAT EVENING

           Lola enters the apartment with an armful of shopping bags.

                                 LOLA
                        Honey!?

           She walks into the living room and finds Luke, sitting 
           stoically on the couch.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Hey! We picked out the flowers 
                        today. They’re gonna look amazing. 
                        And I brought you some winter soup. 
                        For the harvest!

           She scrubs her hands with soap, dries them thoroughly, and 
           starts unloading the groceries, not looking up. She arranges 
           the food items in perfect order, largest to smallest, before 
           placing them in the cabinet. 

           Luke just stares at her, expressionless.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        You hungry?

           Again, silence.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Honey, what’s up? You have a 
                        stroke?

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t think I can do this.

           He’s completely cut off, his eyes void of emotion. Lola stops 
           what she’s doing, looks up in shock.

                                 LOLA
                        What?

           He doesn’t answer. Another beat.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Luke.
           Luke starts to cry.

                                 LUKE
                        I love you, I love you so much, but 
                        I don’t think I can do this 
                        anymore. 

                                 LOLA
                        What do you mean?

                                 LUKE
                        We’ve been together since college. 
                        It’s like... this is crazy.

           Lola starts to tear up.

                                 LOLA
                        No. No, no I know. But we’re the 
                        best. That’s why it’s been just us.

                                 LUKE
                        No, we’ve been coasting-

                                 LOLA
                        It’s just cold feet, you’re-- 
                        you’re nervous-- this is what you 
                        wanted, no one forced you-

                                 LUKE
                        I’m not. It’s not...I’m sorry. I 
                        have to do this for myself. I don’t 
                        know who I am anymore when I’m with 
                        you. You do everything for me and I 
                        feel like I need to learn how to do 
                        shit for myself. 

                                 LOLA
                        But that’s a good thing! I help 
                        you. That’s what-

                                 LUKE
                        We’ve just become too codependent. 
                        We only hang out with each other. 
                        We don’t have any other friends. 

                                 LOLA
                        What do you mean? You hang out with 
                        Henry, your friends from the 
                        gallery-

                                 LUKE
                        Henry’s your best friend.
                         LOLA
           But you two’ve grown really 
           close.
                                                      LUKE
                                          I love you and I’ve pictured 
                                          myself spending the rest of 
                                          my life with you, okay, 
                                          that’s why I proposed in the 
                                          first place, but it’s not the 
                                          only reason.

                                 LOLA
                        You’re the one who comes from 
                        money, what, what other reason?

                                 LUKE
                        No--you’re misunderstanding me--

                                 LOLA
                        Then make yourself clear!

                                 LUKE
                        My parents always made me look at 
                        marriage as a fraudulent 
                        institution you know, and my whole 
                        life I’ve wanted to prove them 
                        wrong--

                                 LOLA
                        You did! We did!

                                 LUKE
                        And maybe that’s why I feel this 
                        way. Or maybe I feel bad because I 
                        know it’s what you wanted.

                                 LOLA
                        You’re marrying me because you feel 
                        bad for me?

                                 LUKE
                        Oh god, I know that sounds 
                        terrible. I don’t know what I’m 
                        saying. 

                                 LOLA
                        Just think of all the lonely 
                        miserable people out there we know. 
                        They’re desperate to have what we 
                        have.

                                 LUKE
                        Lola, that’s not what this is 
                        about.

                        All of a sudden the marriage made 
                        me think about all these other 
                        things. We’re both still getting 
                        our footing, you in particular--

                                 LOLA
                        I’m a writer, Luke. I’m not getting 
                        my footing.

                                 LUKE
                        You just never seem to be writing. 
                        You’re a perennial PhD, in 29 years 
                        you’ve never not been in school!

                                 LOLA
                        You’re the one who encouraged me to 
                        follow my dream!

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah, it’s just you feel stuck, and 
                        I don’t know how to get you 
                        unstuck.

           Lola says nothing.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I need to know what it is to be 
                        alone. I just need time to think 
                        about who I am outside of this 
                        relationship. 

                                 LOLA
                        Why are you doing this now? Why not 
                        before? You know who you are, 
                        you’re a great artist--

                                 LUKE
                        I’ve defined myself through you, 
                        not myself. It’s a gut feeling you 
                        know, I feel this in my gut... that 
                        this isn’t something I should do.

                                 LOLA
                        Woah hold on, just... stop. Can 
                        we... just take a moment and really 
                        think about this? We can wait 
                        another couple months.

                                 LUKE
                        No, I don’t want to go to therapy. 
                        It’s only going to prolong the 
                        inevitable. I know in my heart this 
                        is what I need right now.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        Let’s just take a break. It doesn’t 
                        have to be permanent.

           He takes a long moment to think. Then:

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry, Lo. 

           Lola looks at him, aware there’s nothing she can say to 
           change his mind. A tear rolls down her cheek. She cries 
           quietly, never moving from the doorway. 

           INT. BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Lola sits on the bathroom floor, weeping uncontrollably. She 
           is a teary, sloppy mess, doubled over in pain.

           INT. KAREN AND LENNY’S APARTMENT- DAY

           Lola lies on the couch. She hasn’t moved in days. She is 
           covered in blankets, food surrounds her, as well as a number 
           of bottles of KOMBUCHA.

           Her mother is on the phone in the kitchen. Lenny sits with 
           Lola, strokes her hair.

                                 KAREN
                        That’s not the issue, Martha, the 
                        issue is forty guests have all 
                        bought their tickets for a 
                        destination wedding at a holistic 
                        retreat in CHIAPAS in two weeks, so 
                        YOU TELL ME who is supposed to pay 
                        these people back cause I promise 
                        you it ain’t gonna be Lola and it 
                        ain’t gonna be us when your 
                        heartless SHIT EATING son decided 
                        to pull the plug and ruin my 
                        daughter’s life!!!

           Karen holds her hand over the receiver, whispers to Lola.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Just drink the Kombucha honey, it 
                        settles the soul. (Into phone) Yes, 
                        I’m still here Martha...unlike some 
                        people.
                                 LENNY
                           (whispers)
                        Fuck the Kombucha, let me buy you 
                        something with high fructose corn 
                        syrup. You want nasty Cinnamon 
                        buns? Let’s go to the mall, eat‘em 
                        nasty. I can pour soda on top. 
                        Please, anything, anything.

                                 LOLA
                        Just hug me.

           He does as she says. Karen’s phone conversation with Luke’s 
           mother fades into the background as the camera moves in on 
           Lola’s face as she zones further and further out.

           INT. KAREN AND LENNY’S APARTMENT- THE NEXT DAY

           Lola sits in the same spot, in the same clothes, a few empty 
           bottles of Kombucha lay at her feet. 

           After a few moments, Alice walks in the door, sits next to 
           Lola and takes her in her arms, not saying a word. Knowing 
           there are no words to say. She strokes her hair, Lola closes 
           her eyes.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Lola, deeply depressed, wanders around the East Village, 
           aimlessly. She has no where to go, and no where to be. She 
           halfheartedly looks in the windows of a few shops eventually 
           stumbling upon the entrance to the “Russian Baths.”

           INT. RUSSIAN BATHS - DAY

           Lola sits among old RUSSIAN MEN and WOMEN pouring buckets of 
           cold water over their heads in a deathly hot room filled with 
           steam. She looks lost, afraid to make eye contact with any of 
           them.  

           A THIN SLAVIC MAN approaches her with a large oak leaf called 
           a PLATZA in his right hand. He motions for her to try it. She 
           rejects it, cowering back in her position, but he insists, 
           waves her on.  

           INT. RUSSIAN BATHS - DAY 

           The Slavic Man is beating her with the Platza plant in the 
           tradition of the treatment as Lola weeps. 
                                 SLAVIC MAN 
                        Release your emotions! Feel the 
                        healing power of the Platza! 

           An OLD RUSSIAN WOMAN comes over and dumps a GIANT BUCKET of 
           cold water over her head. She mutters a few Russian 
           blessings. Lola convulses, her body in shock.

           EXT. CHINATOWN STREET- MORNING

           Lola walks down the street, looking a little worse for the 
           wear. She is on her cellphone.

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, I’m actually--

           A FIRE TRUCK zooms by, sirens BLARING.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, hold on one sec, I’m--

           She tries to escape the noise but is confronted by a 
           screaming CHILD on the sidewalk as his MOTHER screams back.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                           (yelling over the noise)
                        ...just down the block. Is it okay 
                        if I come up, I need to talk to you 
                        about something.

           She walks out into the crosswalk as a CAR speeds up, nearly 
           hitting her. She gasps. The car slams on the breaks, HONKS 
           loudly. The noise is deafening. Off Lola, clenched jaw...

           INT. CHINATOWN APARTMENT- MOMENTS LATER

           Lola sits across from a WOMAN in her mid 20s. The apartment 
           behind her is small. Depression era small.

                                 LOLA
                        The thing is, I realize I subletted 
                        this place to you sort of 
                        indefinitely, but um...

                                 WOMAN
                        I know exactly where this is going, 
                        and it’s perfect because I was just 
                        gonna call you and see if you could 
                        find someone else to sublet. My 
                        boyfriend just proposed.
           She flashes a teensy diamond on her finger. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna move in together.

           Lola looks heartbroken. 

                                 LOLA
                           (sadly)
                        Congratulations.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

           Lola buys a case of wine and a handful of those mini-Vodka 
           bottles, shoves them into her purse.

           INT. ALICE’S APARTMENT-NIGHT

           Lola sits on Alice’s couch drinking out of a wine bottle and 
           eating chips. Alice sits across from her, gorging herself 
           with ice cream.

                                 LOLA
                        I haven’t lived alone since my 
                        Sophomore year of college.

                                 ALICE
                        That’s not true, is it?

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, and even then Luke was coming 
                        over like every night.

                                 ALICE
                        You’re going to adjust, you’ll see, 
                        it’s going to be invigorating.

                                 LOLA
                        You don’t have to pity me. 
                        Seriously. I don’t wanna be one of 
                        those women who gets left and then 
                        complains all the time and everyone 
                        hates them for being mopey and 
                        cynical.

                                 ALICE
                        Shit, I better shut up then. 

                                 LOLA
                        I better shut up. Let’s talk about 
                        something else. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOLA (CONT'D)
                        Like why are those Indian babies 
                        smoking on Youtube? Are you worried 
                        about that? It seems like it’s 
                        real, I mean the smoke is coming 
                        out-

                                 ALICE
                        Lola. Stop.

                                 LOLA
                        What?

                                 ALICE
                        Just vent. You’re allowed.

                                 LOLA
                        You sure?

                                 ALICE
                        Yes. go.

                                 LOLA
                        Okay. It’s just, he’s my partner in 
                        crime, he’s the person I wanna wake 
                        up to and go to sleep with, he’s 
                        the reason I went back to school to 
                        get my PhD. He told me to follow my 
                        dreams of being a writer. I can’t 
                        afford it now without splitting the 
                        bills.

                                 ALICE
                        You can still go to school, you’ll 
                        just go work at your mom’s 
                        restaurant part-time like you did 
                        after we graduated.

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, I guess you’re right. If I 
                        can remember how. I’m so f-ed. My 
                        world is shattered. And I’m eating. 
                        I’m power eating. 

                                 ALICE
                        I can’t believe this is happening.
                        At Bard you and Luke were like 
                        whatever a prom king and queen 
                        would be at a school that doesn’t 
                        believe in labels, competition, or 
                        deodorant.

                                 LOLA
                        He was perfect.
                                 ALICE
                        Luke is far from perfect. 

                                 LOLA
                        He’s a successful artist, he has a 
                        really nice apartment, he’s funny, 
                        he likes the same things as me--

                                 ALICE
                        Like what?

                                 LOLA
                        We both like eating. 

                                 ALICE
                        Well that narrows it down.

                                 LOLA
                        We both like sex.

                                 ALICE
                        You don’t even like sex, except for 
                        when your brain tricks you into 
                        thinking it’s about love, so your 
                        uterus has an orgasm.

                                 LOLA
                        That’s not true. 

                                 ALICE
                        It is.

                                 LOLA
                        What about our friends? Are we 
                        supposed to split them up? We know 
                        all the same people. How are we 
                        gonna hang out in the same circles? 

                                 ALICE
                        You guys don’t have that many 
                        friends, it’s not that bad.

                                 LOLA
                        That’s true. Except Henry. He’s our 
                        mutual friend.

                                 ALICE
                        Honestly, this is good, Lo. Like 
                        whatever. You do need to be on your 
                        own, dating other people again. 
                                 LOLA
                        I’m a 29 year old woman. What I 
                        need to be is married.

                                 ALICE
                        You’ve never been with anyone else 
                        and that’s not good for character! 
                        Look at me! 

           Lola looks up at her, sadly.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Being single builds character!

           By this point Alice has ice cream all over her face. The door 
           buzzes. Alice gets up and presses “Listen.”

                                 INTERCOM
                        It’s Henry!

           Alice lets him in. Within seconds HENRY enters.

                                 HENRY
                        Lo, I’m so sorry. I don’t know if 
                        you want to see me right now, but I 
                        wanted you to know I’m here. 

           He goes over to her, gives her a hug. She tenses at his 
           touch.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s weird. You’re both my

                        Choose a side.

                                 HENRY
                        You know I can’t do that.

                                 LOLA
                        You’re mine.

                                 HENRY
                        ...You are prettier than him.

           She smiles at him, as Alice looks on, still eating ice cream.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Softer skin, which I like. Better 
                        at freestyling.
                                 ALICE
                        She wins.

                                 LOLA
                        Gimme a beat.

           Henry beatboxes as Lola freestyles.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Your hair is funny/my nose is 
                        runny/every dude wants to get on

                        say what I say/Lola’s gonna get mad 
                        high today...

           INT. BAR - THE NEXT NIGHT

           Lola and Alice roll into a small hidden bar full of single 
           MEN and WOMEN. The music thumps. People are dancing, talking 
           loudly, smoking.

           Lola coughs as she inhales a big puff of smoke, fighting 
           through the crowd with Alice.

                                 ALICE
                           (over the music)
                        Let’s get a drink!

           Lola nods “yes,” frantically, as they push their way to the 
           bar. Various MEN ogle Lola as she cuts through the crowd. One 
           guy puts his HAND on her back. She shrugs it off, 
           uncomfortably, keeps walking.

           Her eyes dart around the bar at various singles co-mingling. 
           Overstimulating images of people dancing, bits of 
           conversation, attack her senses like rapid-fire. 

           She locks eyes with a WALL STREET GUY, 30s, handsome. They 
           stare at each other. We jump inside her imagination and see 
           him having sex with her. She hates it. She snaps out of the 
           fantasy.

           She starts to sense a panic attack coming on. She notices it 
           coming, breathes, but can’t overcome it. Alice notices 
           something is up. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        What’s up? Are you okay?

                                 LOLA
                        No. I have to leave. Something... 
                        I’m... having... a... panic attack.
                                 ALICE
                        Okay, okay, let’s get out of here 
                        c’mon.

           They push there way back out through the crowd.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Lola and Alice burst out of the bar, start walking down the 
           sidewalk. Lola is seriously hyperventilating.

                                 ALICE
                        Breathe. It’s okay. I’m right here. 
                        Everything is okay. Calm down. It’s 
                        just a bar.

           Lola is wheezing uncontrollably. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Do I need to call 9-1-1?

           Lola shakes her head, “no,” calming a bit. She closes her 
           eyes, breathing deep breaths over and over.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m okay, go back inside. I’m gonna 
                        head home.

                                 ALICE
                        Are you crazy? I’m not letting you 
                        leave alone.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m fine, I promise. Go back inside 
                        and find a guy who can trick your 
                        brain into having an orgasm. I’m 
                        gonna get it on with my vibrator.

                                 ALICE
                        Okay, fine. Let me hail you a cab 
                        at least. 

           Alice flags one down, Lola gets inside.

                                 LOLA
                        Thanks. Love you.

                                 ALICE
                        Love you, too. Go home, take a hot 
                        shower and try and find your 
                        soulmate on Chat Roulette.
           INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

           Lola drives off in the back of the cab, picks up her cell 
           phone, dials.

                                 LOLA
                        Hey, you at home?

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Lola sits on the floor as Henry opens a bottle of wine in the 
           kitchen.

                                 LOLA
                        I just don’t get it. Was I that 
                        much in denial? I mean, there was 
                        some love there, right? He did love 
                        me a little bit, right?

                                 HENRY
                        Yes!! He was in denial, don’t blame 
                        yourself. He should have been 
                        telling you how he felt.

                                 LOLA
                        I feel like an idiot, like everyone 
                        saw it but me.

                                 HENRY
                        Nobody saw it. Fucking lightning.

                                 LOLA
                        He never told you anything?

                                 HENRY
                        Never. All he wanted to do was have 
                        fun when we were out, and sometimes 
                        act like he wasn’t in a 
                        relationship. But that’s what guys 
                        do, doesn’t necessarily mean 
                        anything.

                                 LOLA
                        He didn’t- 

                                 HENRY
                        No. He would never.

           Lola knows he’s telling the truth.
                                 LOLA
                        I feel like men are always looking 
                        for what’s better and women are 
                        just looking for what works.

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t feel like that. I wanna 
                        meet someone I can hang out with 
                        all the time. Eat bologna with. 
                        Read shit to me.

           Lola turns sad.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, remember when we did mushrooms 
                        at your parents country house?

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah.

                                 HENRY
                        And you made us go in that swamp 
                        full of nasty shit cause you 
                        thought we owed it to the plant 
                        life?

                                 LOLA
                        Those plants needed us.

                                 HENRY
                        You were convinced we would never 
                        get out, and I calmed you down by 
                        singing a weird slowed down version 
                        of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, and 
                        then we went in the house and ate 
                        gummy cherries til we weren't high 
                        anymore.

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah. Best/worst night ever. What's 
                        your point?

           Henry smiles warmly.

                                 HENRY
                        I get you outta swamps.

           INT. CHINATOWN APARTMENT- THE NEXT MORNING

           An ALARM blares. Lola wakes up in an empty bed. She reaches 
           her hand into the space next to her, where Luke once slept, 
           but finds she is alone. She feels the weight of his absence.
           INT. GYM - LATER

           Lola is working out hard on the elliptical machine. She 
           watches the Food Network on her mini TV as she peddles 
           ferociously.

           The camera pans down the row to reveal other women 
           simultaneously working out and watching the Food Network like 
           it was porn. Lola talks on her cellphone, breathless.

                                 LOLA
                        I need you to go get my stuff from 
                        his place. I can’t do it. Please. 
                        It’s just... Just bring it to my 
                        old apartment in Chinatown, that’s 
                        where I’m living again. Use the key 
                        I gave you...yeah...thanks...I owe 
                        you one.

           She puts her headphones back in.  

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Lola gets changed at her locker. Semi-naked women of 
           different shapes and sized abound, all at various stages of 
           getting ready. They look each other’s bodies, discreetly, 
           trying not to be overt about it. 

           We see images from Lola’s imagination of the various women 
           having sex. One is very loud, one is role playing, another is 
           with an almost elderly man. This freaks Lola out. 

           The daydream abruptly ends, leaving a disgusted look on her 
           face. She sadly packs her gym clothes into her bag.

           INT. CHINATOWN APARTMENT- MOMENTS LATER

           Lola sits in her apartment, reading a book. There is a knock 
           on the door. She is startled, calls out.

                                 LOLA
                        Who is it?

                                 LUKE
                        It’s me.

           Lola freezes. We see Luke on the other side of the door.
                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I brought you halvah from Russ and 
                        Daughters. And the Babka that you 
                        said could bring about world peace 
                        it was so good.

           Lola’s eyes begin to water. She is paralyzed.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Please, Lola. I know you’re in 
                        there.

           Lola curls into a ball on the couch, clutching a pillow for 
           dear life.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Look. We’re going to miss each 
                        other. That’s totally normal. And 
                        obviously we’re still going to have 
                        feelings for each other, I just 
                        want us to push ourselves to try to 
                        be alone for the first time in our 
                        lives. It’s going to be hard. But 
                        we have to stick with it. Can you 
                        hear me?

           She does.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I love you. I think I’m doing 
                        what’s best for both of us. I just 
                        want you to know I’m still here and 
                        want you in my life.  

           Lola quietly weeps.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        You’re the Whitney to my Bobby.

           She smiles through the tears.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll just leave the food at the 
                        door.

           He places the bag gently on the floor, and leaves.

           INT. LIBRARY - LATER 

           Lola sits at a desk, typing on her laptop, surrounded by 
           books. 
           There are poem collections by Charles Baudelaire and Stephane 
           Mallarme, as well as a variety of contemporary theory 
           compilations about silence.  

           She is having a difficult time focusing. She taps her desk 
           with a pen. TAP, TAP, TAP, TAP. A GUY across the way makes 
           eyes with her. She stares back.

           On her laptop we see her researching vows of silence and 
           landing on a Wikipedia page for the “Trappist Monks.” She 
           freezes, hurled into the memory of her jokes not long ago 
           with Luke.

           Then her phone rings a POP SONG ring tone. She doesn’t answer 
           it, still lost in the memory. Someone else in the library 
           looks over.

                                 WOMAN
                        Shhhhhhhhhhh.

           Lola silences the phone.

           INT. CHINATOWN APARTMENT- NIGHT

           Lola sits in her tiny, empty apartment, surrounded by boxes. 
           She is at a loss. She picks up her phone, texts Henry.

           INT. CHINATOWN APARTMENT- LATER

           Henry sits next to Lola on the couch, passing a bottle of 
           whiskey between them as they watch a Hillary Duff movie. 

           Lola starts laughing at something stupid, then chokes on the 
           whiskey, spitting all over herself. Henry laughs at her 
           hysterically.

           INT. CHINATOWN APARTMENT- THE NEXT MORNING

           Lola wakes up on the couch in Henry’s arms. She’s surprised 
           to see herself there, a bit uncomfortable, but strangely 
           soothed. She looks at the clock.

                                 LOLA
                        Hen. You gotta wake up.

           Henry opens his eyes, smiles. Then realizes where he is.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh, shit.
                                 LOLA
                        I could eat a brick.

                        Nah, I gotta go to work. 

           She changes course.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        I had a weird dream that you talked 
                        to Luke. Has he said anything?

                                 HENRY
                        Not really, just that he hates that 
                        you’re completely ignoring him.

                                 LOLA
                        He can suffer for the time being.

           INT. RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON

           Lola, clad in all black with pen and paper, waits on a table 
           of two. The COUPLE stares at their menus for an unimaginably 
           long amount of time.

                                 LOLA
                        Do you want me to come back?

                                 MAN
                        We’re almost ready. Just stand 
                        there.

           They continue to take their time. Finally:
                                 WOMAN
                        Um...I’ll have the...Gnocki 
                        (pronounced “Knock-y”). And a glass 
                        of the Sangreesha.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh, you mean Sangria? We don’t have 
                        that.

                                 WOMAN
                        I thought this was an Italian 
                        restaurant.

                                 LOLA
                        It is.

                                 MAN
                           (gruff)
                        You have wine, put fruit cocktail 
                        in it.

                                 LOLA
                        Okay.

           Lola takes their menus, and walks away. She puts their orders 
           into the system but can’t remember the code. She frantically 
           presses buttons until she finally gets it right.

           Tending bar is RANDY, 29, gay, dry as a desert but loud as 
           hell. 

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Can you put fruit cocktail in a 
                        glass of wine for me?

                                 RANDY
                        Can you put a bullet in a gun for 
                        me? 

           He starts searching for fruit cocktail behind the bar. A hot 
           fellow WAITRESS walks by. Randy calls to her.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Who’s the hottest woman I’ve ever 
                        seen! I will blow you!

                                 HOT WAITRESS
                           (laughing)
                        Hi, Randy.

                                 LOLA
                           (under her breath)
                        Ugh.
           She walks to the back room of the restaurant to change into 
           her work gear. 

                                 RANDY
                        If that girl had a dick my life 
                        would have purpose.

                                 LOLA
                        Strange, usually hookers make 
                        enough money with their night 
                        shifts.

                                 RANDY
                        Don’t hate, she pulls in bigger 
                        tips than a Po-lice hotline.

           Lola stands there, drinking a club soda. The couple sits at 
           the table, the woman speaking could be heard from the 
           restaurant across the street.

                                 WOMAN
                        I says to Norma, it’s Christmas, 
                        who makes Chicken Enchiladas? You 
                        remember last Christmas, there were 
                        a dozen Chicken Enchiladas like we 
                        were lookin’ to lay on a beach. You 
                        know me and tequila, don’t get me 
                        near it, you remember Cabo with the 
                        Mangetti’s, I almost had an affair 
                        with an amputee. 

           KAREN walks in.

                                 KAREN
                        Hello, everybody.

                                 LOLA
                        Hey, Mom.

                                 KAREN
                        Hi, sweetie. You doing okay?

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah.

                                 KAREN
                        Good, I want to talk to you about 
                        something important. 

                                 LOLA
                        What?
                                 KAREN
                        I was thinking about this in the 
                        cab while I was watching the little 
                        TV. You have to freeze.

                                 LOLA
                        Why?

                                 KAREN
                        What do you mean why? Do you want 
                        to give birth to a devil spawn 
                        that’s half developed?

                                 LOLA
                        You’re about a hundred steps ahead 
                        of me right now. I’m not having 
                        children any time soon. 

                                 KAREN
                        Exactly my point. But you will. 
                        They don’t freeze it with broccoli. 
                        They freeze them in a good 
                        facility, trust me, my friend 
                        Debbie did it, she’s got eggs all 
                        over the city. Six happy children. 
                        One is a giant but very nice. 

                                 LOLA
                        Let me grieve first. Please.

                                 KAREN
                        I’m just trying to think 
                        practically on your behalf, Lord 
                        knows we’re not getting any 
                        younger.

                                 LOLA
                        Just talk to me about something 
                        else please.

                                 KAREN
                        I got my coot waxed at your place 
                        around the corner. She told me she 
                        gave a girl pubes in the shape of a 
                        flame when she had a date with a 
                        fireman. I don’t know what they 
                        use, but the hair, OFF like a 
                        banana peel. 

           Pause.

                        Honey not that I don’t love having 
                        you back, but what? You had a T.A. 
                        gig lined up, no?

                                 LOLA
                        Oh yeah I realized I hate NYU kids. 
                        What are you doing today?

                                 KAREN
                        I have an appointment with a 
                        Holographic Repatterning Therapist 
                        and then a Ball Rolling workshop.

                                 LOLA
                        Take a ‘me’ day.

                                 KAREN
                        I’m 58 years old. I’m done giving. 
                        Give to me. Now is the time to eat. 
                        I want food. 

           Lola grabs the ad hoc “Sangria” Randy just prepared, brings 
           it to the couple over at the table. 

                                 LOLA
                        Sangreesha. House specialty.

           She hands them a messy pitcher stuffed to the brim with whole 
           apples and a little wine. The couple looks at her in horror.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Lola leaves the restaurant, walks down the sidewalk in a 
           hurry. She carries a THERMOS in a pouch with a long strap 
           over her shoulder and a backpack.

           EXT. NYU - DAY

           Lola walks up to NYU, sees Luke waiting for her. She looks 
           startled.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey.

                                 LOLA

                        I’m sorry to surprise you like this 
                        but you didn’t call me back. Can I 
                        talk to you for a sec?

                                 LOLA
                        Um... I’m really late for my 
                        prospectus meeting. I don’t think I 
                        can right now. 

                                 LUKE
                        What’s that thing over your 
                        shoulder?

                                 LOLA
                        I’m cleansing. I drink it out of 
                        this thing. The potion. 

                                 LUKE
                        Oh.

                                 LOLA
                        So... 

                                 LUKE
                        I’ve been thinking about things...

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah?

           Luke struggles to find the right words.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m confused. I don’t know what I’m 
                        doing. I might have acted 
                        irrationally. I don’t know.

                                 LOLA
                        What, what do you mean?

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t know, I just miss you.

                                 LOLA
                        You’re doing this right before I’m 
                        about to go in and defend my 
                        thesis? That’s rich.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m sorry, you won’t pick up my 
                        calls. I know. I’m all over the 
                        place, I didn’t mean to surprise 
                        you, it’s just-
                                 LOLA
                        I gotta go.

                                 LUKE
                        I was overwhelmed by everything 
                        that was happening.

                                 LOLA
                        I want to talk about this, I do, I 
                        just... not right now.

                                 LUKE
                        Can I meet you after?

                                 LOLA
                        Are you saying all this just ‘cause 
                        you’re lonely?

                                 LUKE
                        No. I don’t know.

           Lola looks at him, pained, and wanting to give in.

                                 LOLA
                        Luke. I wanted this, it’s what I 
                        asked for, you know? We could have 
                        given it some time, tried to work 
                        through it together, but you were 
                        convinced. It didn’t have to be 
                        that way. But it is what it is. And 
                        now you’ve convinced me. So...

           Beat.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        I really have to go.

           She slowly back up from him, confused and fearful. He knows 
           he can’t stop her.

           Lola sits outside of a lecture hall going over a binder full 
           of notes. People buzz by, she can hardly focus, one 
           distraction after another. Her mind races, analyzing the 
           moments she spent with Luke not minutes ago. 

           She takes a couple of deep breaths, preparing herself for the 
           worst. She pours herself a drink from her thermos. It tastes 
           so gnarly, she has to spit it back inside.
           INT. NYU LECTURE HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Lola sits before five professors, all very intimidating. She 
           is in the midst of her PhD dissertation prospectus meeting.

                                 LOLA
                        Essentially, I’ll be investigating 
                        the use of silence in 19th Century 
                        French Literature.

                                 PROFESSOR #1
                        Do you still want to use the poetry 
                        of Mallarme?

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, as you can see in my outline, 
                        one of the introductory chapters is 
                        heavily focussed on his work. I’d 
                        like to look at his obsession with 
                        the blank page, really exploring 
                        the ways in which his verses 
                        engender silence. As opposed to 
                        prose, verses in poetry contain 
                        these line breaks, requiring 
                        silence and pause.

                                 PROFESSOR #2
                        Perhaps you could devote more than 
                        one chapter to Mallarme, as he 
                        seems to be central to your 
                        defining argument. 

                                 LOLA
                        Absolutely. In addition to his 
                        verses, I’d also like to look at 
                        silence in media, literature, and 
                        various popular culture outlets in 
                        contemporary American society. 
                        Well, more the lack thereof. In 
                        today’s world. Just our communal, 
                        almost deathly fear of silence.

           The professors sit and stare at her. In silence.

           INT. LOLA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lola tries on different outfits for the evening. Through the 
           walls, she can hear her obnoxious neighbor banging on the 
           piano. She turns on her iPod, blasting from her computer 
           speakers.
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           She is applying make-up in the mirror. A quick image of her 
           middle-aged flashes in the reflection. Startled, she returns 
           to reality.

           A sad love song comes on, and Lola freezes. She can’t help 
           but think about Luke. Her eyes well with tears, but she 
           stifles it, quickly changing the song.

           INT. OFF BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT

           An avant-garde stage play adaptation. Most likely some modern 
           variation of Chekhov.  The play’s handsome lead actor, ROGER, 
           29, sits at a long wooden table, slumped over.

           Alice is a member of the ensemble. She is dressed as a dirty 
           Russian Peasant Woman, and pantomiming near the back of the 
           stage. She is kind of in darkness, but is trying desperately 
           to find her light.   

           Lola watches from the audience, as does Henry, seated next to 
           her. She puts her head on his shoulder.

           EXT. OFF BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT

           The audience exits. People stand outside, chatting. Lola, 
           thermos over her shoulder, waits with Henry.

                                 LOLA
                        She just keeps getting cast as 
                        those damn peasants.

                                 HENRY
                        Was that sign language she was 
                        doing part of the show or was she 
                        translating for someone?

                                 LOLA
                        She did some sort of dream therapy 
                        where she said her character and 
                        her melded in a past life as a deaf-
                        mute. 

                                 HENRY
                        What’s up with that lead guy Roger? 
                        He your friend?
                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, didn’t it seem like he was 
                        kind of sleeping through his 
                        performance?  

                                 HENRY
                        I actually thought he fell asleep 
                        on stage.

                                 LOLA
                        Alice is obsessed with him.

                                 HENRY
                        They’re doing it?

                                 LOLA
                        Don’t say a word.

           Out walks Roger, the star of the play, with Alice, following 
           quickly behind.

                                 ROGER
                        Lola!

                                 LOLA
                        Hey! You were great!

                                 ALICE
                        Thank you.

                                 LOLA
                        You were great, too.

                                 ALICE
                        Was I good? Tell me. Really. Could 
                        you see me?

                                 LOLA
                           (smiling)
                        Yes, it was very believable.

                                 ALICE
                        You’re laughing, why are you 
                        laughing? Was it too much? I can 
                        bring it down. Less viewpointy, 
                        more Congo?

                                 LOLA
                        What does that even mean?
                                 ALICE
                        The whole thing’s a metaphor for 
                        genital mutilation, you didn’t get 
                        that?

           Beat.

                                                     HENRY
                         LOLA
           No, yeah, we did.
                                          Totally.

                                 ROGER
                        The director’s a genius. 

                                 LOLA
                        I thought it was amazing. Really 
                        brave. And you were wonderful, 
                        Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        I had an off night. I accidentally 
                        took an Xanax before the show, I 
                        thought it was an Advil.

                                 ALICE
                        That’s insane you’re insane you’re 
                        so talented! 

           Roger pays her no mind.

                                 HENRY
                        Really amazing work. You were so 
                        alive out there, really present. 
                        The theater as an art form is alive 
                        and well.

           As they dole out small talk, Alice turns into Lola.

                                 ALICE
                           (quietly)
                        I got your text about Luke. Tell 
                        me.

                                 LOLA
                        It was so intense. He says he’s 
                        confused.

                                 ALICE
                        Don’t buy the hype. Set your sights 
                        high, you deserve someone who loves 
                        you. 
           Lola looks to Henry. He catches her eye, widens his eyes as 
           if to say ‘Save me from this conversation.’ Lola turns back, 
           Alice follows.

                                 ROGER
                        Thank you. The old play as new is 
                        truly having a renaissance. You 
                        must be Luke, right?

           Roger goes to shake his hand. Henry looks put off.

                                 HENRY
                        Henry.

                                 ROGER
                        Henry? Oh, Henry, sorry. Roger.

           They shake. Lola looks uncomfortable.

                                 ALICE
                        Should we get a drink??

           EXT. STREET- LATER

           Henry and Lola walk home, post drinks with Roger and Alice, 
           amid other drunk New Yorkers on a Saturday night.

                                 HENRY
                        You want me to carry your thermos?

                                 LOLA
                        That would be awesome.

           She hands it to him, he tries not to laugh. She turns sad 
           suddenly.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Do you think you could stay over 
                        tonight? Nights are the hardest. 

           Henry isn’t sure.

                                 HENRY
                        Um....

           INT. LOLA’S BEDROOM - LATER 

           Lola gets into bed, Henry stands at her bedroom door.

                                 HENRY
                        Good night.
                                 LOLA
                        What do you mean “Good night,” 
                        you’re not sleeping on the floor.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh. What’s your thread count? 

                                 LOLA
                        Like, 2.

                                 HENRY
                        Cool.

           He disrobes, gets in bed. They both lie there for a moment, 
           awkwardly looking around.

                                 LOLA
                        Thanks for being here.

                                 HENRY
                        Of course.

           They look into each other’s eyes. It’s hard to tell if it’s a 
           look of gratitude or something more. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Luke would kill me if he knew I was 
                        in your bed.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m pretty sure Luke no longer has 
                        any jurisdiction over these parts.

                                 HENRY
                        True.

           Lola inches her face closer to his, he slides his body down 
           the bed a bit to be next to hers.

           They keep looking deep into each other’s eyes. Then, 
           suddenly, they kiss. It’s soft and sweet at first. They laugh 
           a little bit, look away. She kisses him again. The intensity 
           grows. Henry breaks out of it.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Stop. We can’t do this.

                                 LOLA
                        We can, it’s fine.

                                 HENRY
                        Luke’s a good friend.
                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, but you’re my best friend.

                                 HENRY
                        All the more reason...I mean I feel 
                        like I’m breaking code, I don’t 
                        know the rules in this situation.

                                 LOLA
                        We can make them up as we go.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m just a rebound.

                                 LOLA
                        No, you’re more of a lay up. 

           He laughs.

                                 HENRY
                        You know I’ve always had feelings 
                        for you.

                                 LOLA
                           (genuine)
                        Honestly, I didn’t know that.

           She kisses him tenderly, then puts her head on his chest. 
           They lie there pretending to go to sleep, both too giddy 
           to...

           INT. CHINATOWN APARTMENT- LATER

           Henry sleeps, while Lola still lays there wide awake. No 
           longer giddy, she looks deeply saddened by what she’s just 
           done. She gets up and takes her phone into the other room.

                                 LOLA
                           (on phone, whispering)
                        Luke?

                                 LUKE
                        Hi.

                                 LOLA
                        ...I miss you so much. Can I see 
                        you?
           EXT. STREET - THE NEXT DAY

           Lola nervously walks down the street with Alice, who is even 
           more nervous than Lola.

                                 LOLA
                        I know I shouldn’t be nervous. But 
                        it’s so much easier to push someone 
                        away than to sit with them face to 
                        face. I don’t know what I’m doing.

           Alice reaches into her purse, brings out a tiny spray bottle.

                                 ALICE
                        Open your mouth.

           Lola does it with out question. Alice sprays as many times as 
           she can before Lola swats her hand away.

                                 LOLA
                        What is that?!! I’m gonna throw up.

           She spits repeatedly onto the street.

                                 ALICE
                        Weed in a bottle. Freshens the 
                        breath and gets you fuuuuuucked 
                        uuuup. I got it in Koreatown last 
                        time I was in LA. Smuggled it back 
                        in my cooch pouch on the plane.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m gonna kill you.

                                 ALICE
                        Relax, just put this weed candy 
                        under your tongue.

           She tries to put something else in Lola’s mouth, Lola hits 
           her with her purse.

                                 LOLA
                        Will you stop! You need help.

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t understand, what is the 
                        point of this meeting? 

                                 LOLA
                        I need closure, I guess... Or I’m 
                        not really sure what I need. I feel 
                        like I’m gonna throw up.
           Alice turns serious, takes a moment, then:

                                 ALICE
                        Lola. Just think. WWKD. 

           Lola looks at Alice blankly, then:

                                 LOLA
                        What is that?

                                 ALICE
                        What. Would. Kim. Do.

                                 LOLA
                        Who is Kim.

                                 ALICE
                        Kardashian.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh my god.

                                 ALICE
                        Tan titties, they break hearts. 
                        Recognize.

           INT. RESTAURANT BATHROOM - DAY

           Lola adjusts her makeup in the mirror. The doorknob JIGGLES.

                                 LOLA
                        Woman inside!

           Toilet. She grabs a PAPER TOILET SEAT COVER from the 
           dispenser, tries to rip out that damn middle section with out 
           ruining the part for the seat. Failure. Always a failure.

           She tries again, places it perfectly on top of the toilet 
           seat when the AUTOMATIC SENSOR goes off, sucking the paper 
           down the toilet. The doorknob jiggles.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        WHAT IS CONFUSING ABOUT A LOCKED 
                        DOOR?!

           INT. RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Lola stands with Karen and Randy at the bar.

                                 LOLA
                        Gimme a drink.
                                 KAREN
                        What’s going on?

                                 RANDY
                        You want, like, a double? Vodka 
                        tonic?

           He looks for a clean glass, they’re all dirty.

                                 LOLA
                        Bowl. Bowl. Just put it in a bowl. 

                                 KAREN
                        Oh this isn’t healthy.

                                 LOLA
                        Mom. I don’t want to hear it right 
                        now. Please don’t make a scene.

                                 KAREN
                        Is breaking a bottle over his head 
                        a scene?

           She closes her eyes and sings quietly to herself.

                                 LOLA
                        Straight up, now tell me do you 
                        really wanna love me forever/Oh, 
                        oh, oh/Or am I caught in a hit-and-
                        run? 

           Randy hands her a bowl full of vodka. She drinks it like a 
           kid slurps soup, just as LUKE approaches from behind. 

                                 LUKE
                        Hi.

                                 LOLA
                        Hey.

                                 LUKE
                        What are you doing?

                                 LOLA
                        It’s an ancient Japanese tradition. 
                        I’m also procuring a miniature rock 
                        garden in my spare time.

                                 LUKE
                        You were always worldly. 

           Karen glares at him. He looks super awkward.
                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Hi, Karen.

                                 KAREN
                        Hi, Devil.

           And with that, she walks away.

                                 LUKE
                        Oh man. Should we... 

                                 LOLA
                        What?

                                 LUKE
                        Go somewhere else?

                                 LOLA
                        Oh. No. Here’s good.

           They make their way to a table.

           INT. RESTAURANT - SECONDS LATER

           Now seated across from one another, Lola arranges the 
           silverware as she speaks.

                                 LOLA
                        How was your day?

                                 LUKE
                        Not bad. Made a few new pieces, 
                        nothing I like.

                                 LOLA
                        Great.

                                 LUKE
                        How’s the dissertation coming?

                                 LOLA
                        Slowly the silence is killing me.

           Hot Waitress approaches.

                                 HOT WAITRESS
                        What can I get you guys?

           Luke looks over the menu. Just then Alice appears outside the 
           window, wearing big sunglasses, walking strangely slow down 
           the block.
           Lola notices, and freezes. Alice pretends to window shop, but 
           she is clearly just staring at a brick wall, gesturing to 
           items that don’t exist.

                                 LUKE
                        Um, I think I’ll get the burger.

                                 HOT WAITRESS
                        And how do you want that cooked?

           Lola motions for her to get out of there, but Alice doesn’t 
           understand, so she starts crouching down in a sort of Sumo 
           wrestler squat.

                                 LUKE
                        Medium is good.

                                 HOT WAITRESS
                        And for you?

                                 LOLA
                        Lamb. Meatballs.

           The Waitress leaves the table. Alice gets the hint, slowly 
           disappears out of the background. Luke turns back to Lola.

                                 LUKE
                        You didn’t have to order, it’s 
                        fine.

                                 LOLA
                        I hate the judgment of women in the 
                        service industry.

                                 LUKE
                        I knew that.

           They sit, unsure how to proceed.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        You look beautiful.

                                 LOLA
                        Thank you.

                                 LUKE
                        You’re welcome.

                                 LOLA
                        So...

                                 LUKE
                        So...
                                 LOLA
                        What did you do with the ring?

                                 LUKE
                        The ring. Right. I know this is 
                        gonna sound weird, but... it’s in 
                        my fridge.

                                 LOLA
                        No, it’s not.

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah. I just knew I wouldn’t lose 
                        it that way.

                                 LOLA
                        You froze my rock?

                                 LUKE
                        It’s just chillin’.

                                 LOLA
                        The reason I... the reason I 
                        haven’t been able to see you was 
                        because...

           She starts to tear up. He waits, patiently.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        ...because a) I didn’t want you to 
                        think I was weak. And needed you. 

                                 LUKE
                        I totally get that.

                                 LOLA
                        And b) I was very angry, and I knew 
                        I wouldn’t be able to hear anything 
                        you wanted to say.

           She has to take a moment or she’s gonna burst into tears.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        I just wanna know. How long... how 
                        long did you know?

                                 LUKE
                        Know what?

                                 LOLA
                        That you were gonna leave me?
                                 LUKE
                        Honestly? Not long. I didn’t 
                        realize until the whole wedding 
                        thing started happening.

                                 LOLA
                        Were you just pretending to love 
                        me?

                                 LUKE
                        Lola. I promise you from the bottom 
                        of my heart I was never pretending. 
                        I love you so much, I just needed a 
                        break. And to make some decisions 
                        for myself.

                                 LOLA
                        It’s okay. I realized that we may 
                        have been living in denial. It’s 
                        okay, it’s okay for us to need some 
                        space... 

                                 LUKE
                        I wanna see you again. I’d like to 
                        try to compromise somehow... I miss 
                        you so much.

                                 LOLA
                        I miss you, too.

                                 LUKE
                        I just want you to know how sorry I 
                        am for the way I went about this. 
                        It was selfish. And dumb. I just 
                        freaked out and didn’t know how to 
                        tell you. I take full 
                        responsibility, even though I 
                        blamed some of it on you before. I 
                        know you probably don’t trust a 
                        word that’s coming out of my mouth, 
                        but it’s the truth.

           He takes her hand, squeezes it.

           INT. NOLITA APARTMENT-LATER

           Luke and Lola are in the midst of passionate love making. It 
           is by far the best sex they’ve ever had but also the most 
           emotional. 

           Luke looks deeply into her eyes, she looks deeply into his, 
           both overwhelmed by the intensity of it all.
           INT. NOLITA APARTMENT- LATER

           Luke and Lola lay on the bed together, post-sex. She starts 
           to cry.

                        Oh, please don’t cry.

                                 LOLA
                        I don’t think I can see you 
                        anymore.

                                 LUKE
                        Why?

                                 LOLA
                        It’s too painful. 

                                 LUKE
                        It doesn’t have to be.

                                 LOLA
                        Luke. You did this for a reason. 
                        You want space. It’s clear. Maybe 
                        that’s what you need before we go 
                        and live a life together. 

                                 LUKE
                        I know I sound like a hypocrite, 
                        but I don’t know if this much space 
                        is what I want anymore.

                                 LOLA
                        It’s only been a few weeks. You 
                        said it yourself, it’s gonna be 
                        hard, but we need to try. Who 
                        knows, maybe I need it, too.

           Luke sits, head in hands, frustrated. He gets up, walks to 
           the bathroom, hops in the shower. Lola lies still, then 
           starts getting dressed. 

           She heads into the kitchen, opens the fridge. A BLACK RING 
           BOX sits on the top shelf. The sight of it sends chills up 
           her spine. 

           She takes it out, places it on the counter as if it’s a 
           highly dangerous weapon. Inspects it for a long while. 
           Eventually, she opens it. A beautiful gold ring with a pear 
           shaped diamond sits inside. It’s stunning.
           She breathes deep, then snaps it shut, sealing off her pain. 
           Slams the fridge closed.

           She walks into the living room, looks around. On the table is 
           Luke’s CELL PHONE. A wave of panic comes over her. She 
           impulsively starts checking his text messages. 

           We see one text from a girl named PEGGY. It reads: “Hey. What 
           r u doing?”

           Her cellphone rings, causing her to jump. She puts his phone 
           down, picks hers up.

                        Hi.

           Intercut with Alice, who is on the street.

                                 ALICE
                        You went AWOL for three hours. I 
                        thought he killed you and 
                        disappeared into the Catskills.

                           (whispering)
                        We just had sex.

                                 ALICE
                        I saw a 20/20 just like that. Girl 
                        who was supposed to be married, 
                        head found severed-

                                 LOLA
                        I said we just had sex! Are you 
                        listening?!

                                 ALICE
                        Yes I’m listening! You might as 
                        well have no head, though, you 
                        certainly aren’t using it.

           INT. SOUEN RESTAURANT- LATER

           Alice and Lola both eat Macro Plates.

                        I was feeling so responsible, like 
                        it was my fault, but now I feel 
                        better in this way, like a weight 
                        has been lifted. What is this, 
                        Kukicha? I’m drunk, I love 
                        macrobiotic food.
                                 ALICE
                        Who puts your sentences together? A 
                        schizophrenic? You’re brain is like 
                        a bad DJ.

                                 LOLA
                        The thing is, I don’t trust him. I 
                        checked his text messages and saw 
                        something from this girl Peggy.

                                 ALICE
                        Huh. Could just be a friend. Or 
                        someone he works with or something.

                                 LOLA
                        Or a skank that I’m gonna murder. 
                        If he really wants to get back 
                        together he’s gonna have to prove 
                        it. 

                                 ALICE
                        At least you’ve got options. I 
                        can’t even find someone to love me 
                        momentarily at the moment of orgasm 
                        which is really an easy moment to 
                        love someone fleetingly, no?

                                 LOLA
                        Don’t be upset.

                                 ALICE
                        I’m not upset, this is me like 
                        coasting.

                                 LOLA
                        Alice, I read people’s energies for 
                        a living.

                                 ALICE
                        No, you don’t.

                                 LOLA
                        I know, but I’ve always wanted to 
                        say that.

                                 ALICE
                        Roger wouldn’t have sex with me.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh boy.
                                 ALICE
                        Like I was some refugee, and then I 
                        got drunk by myself unless a bottle 
                        of Kahlua counts as a partner and 
                        went back and hate fucked him. 
                        Twice.

                                 LOLA
                        Well, why don’t you just sit Roger 
                        down and be really real with him 
                        then? Tell him you love him but you 
                        need him to make a commitment.

                                 ALICE
                        But I don’t love him. I don’t even 
                        like him.

                                 LOLA
                        Then why are you so upset?

                                 ALICE
                        Because he’s good enough. And I 
                        don’t want to be alone anymore. 
                        Maybe you’re right, maybe I should 
                        just date Henry. 

                                 LOLA
                        Oh. Um. I have to tell you 
                        something.

                                 ALICE
                        He’s gay right? I frickin’ knew he 
                        was too good to be true.

                                 LOLA
                        No. Not at all. We’ve kinda been 
                        hooking up.

                                 ALICE
                        WHAT?! Back up the train. Why 
                        didn’t you tell me??

                                 LOLA
                        I didn’t want you to judge me.

                                 ALICE
                        Judge you? I’m gonna buy you a 
                        trophy, you whore. This is exactly 
                        what you need. It’s funtown USA! 
                        Ride that roller coaster till you 
                        puke up the candy. 
                                 LOLA
                        I feel like he wants to be 
                        boyfriend girlfriend though and it 
                        kinda freaks me out.

                                 ALICE
                        Should I slit my wrists now or wait 
                        ‘til after the meal?

                                 LOLA
                        Oh stop, I bet you’ll find someone 
                        the second you stop looking. How’s 
                        match.com going?

                                 ALICE
                        So you’re saying now.

           Lola smiles.

           EXT. FERRY - DAY

           Lola and Henry stand on the edge of the Ferry boat, looking 
           out over the water.

                        I’m not gonna lie, I did a little 
                        Wikiped’ing. This Dutch guy bought 
                        the Island from the Native 
                        Americans in the 1600s for two ax 
                        heads, a string of beads, and a 
                        handful of nails.

                                 LOLA
                        Sounds fair.

           EXT. GOVERNOR’S ISLAND - DAY

           They bike around the island and take it all in: the prison, 
           the old movie theater, the art installations, mini golf 
           course. They have a lot of fun.
           As the sun is setting, they lay on the grass, look out over 
           the great Island of Manhattan, imagining what it was 300 
           years ago. Lola sneaks a glance at Henry, wondering about 
           their relationship...

                        Yep. We both dated other people and 
                        then realized no one ever really 
                        compared.

                        No. You’d have to run me down with

                        You know in the 70’s, people your

                        It’s looked down upon now, 
                        especially for a woman, but maybe 
                        going against the societal norm is 
                        actually what you need for the time 
                        being, you know, to realize 
                        something about yourself or the men

                        to look forward to? And I hate 
                        seeing you in so much pain. 

                                 LOLA
                        Pain is beauty. 

                                 LENNY
                        Hey. I know having your mom and I 
                        as parents has kinda made you a 
                        stressed out kid. You put a lot of 
                        pressure on yourself. To live out a 
                        life that is maybe more 
                        conventional than the one you were 
                        raised in.

           Lola takes this in. Lenny puts his hand on her shoulder.

                                 LENNY (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes it’s good to shake life 
                        up a little. Let it slip out of 
                        your hands. You’ll catch it. 
           INT. LOLA’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

           Lola applies make-up, does a quick shave of the legs and 
           armpits sans shower.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           She picks out outfits. She hates all her clothes, throws them 
           on the ground. Through the wall, we hear the piano again. 
           Lola bangs hard on the wall with her fist. It doesn’t stop.

           She pauses for a second. We slip inside her mind, and watch 
           her destroy the piano next door with a sledgehammer as the 
           whole family watches in horror. Back to reality. 

           She turns her speakers towards the wall, blasts music.

           EXT. SANTO’S PARTY HOUSE-LATER THAT NIGHT

           Lola stands outside the club as Alice approaches. Alice’s 
           skin is bright orange. She’s grinning.

                                 LOLA
                        What happened to you?

                                 ALICE
                        I spray tanned what happened to 
                        you?

                                 LOLA
                        I don’t see you for a week and your 
                        ethnicity is suddenly ambiguous.

                                 ALICE
                        It’s a conversation starter!

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, like ‘Hey, I’m Alice, I may 
                        look like I have Hepatitis B but I 
                        swear I’m yellow by choice...’

                                 ALICE
                        If that was a racist remark, I’m 
                        really mad, you know my Nana was 
                        Philippino.

                                 LOLA
                        Your Nana was a maid, she wasn’t 
                        actually related to you by blood.
                                 ALICE
                        Can we go inside? I wanna start 
                        telling people I was on a vacation.

           INT. SANTO’S PARTY HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER

           They enter the club, full of grungy hipsters and model types.

                                 ALICE
                        Where’s Henry?

                                 LOLA
                        He’s probably backstage.

           A HOT GUY passes. Alice speaks to him as he walks away.

                                 ALICE
                        Hi, I’m thirty years old and I’m 
                        looking to have children.

                                 LOLA
                        You’re twenty nine.

                                 ALICE
                        I round up, then I get the Cougar 
                        advantage.

                                 LOLA
                        I was walking down the street the 
                        other day and I passed a fourteen-
                        year-old boy, real scumbag, 
                        skateboard and everything, and I 
                        thought it’d be cool if I let him 
                        get with me.

                                 ALICE
                        Yeah. That’d be cool.

                                 LOLA
                        You think that’d be nasty or that’d 
                        be cool?

                                 ALICE
                        I think I’ll give you a hundred 
                        dollars if you let that little kid 
                        finger your poon.

           INT. CLUB - LATER

           Lola and Alice watch Henry’s band play.
                                 ALICE
                        Oh shit.

                                 LOLA
                        You gotta take a shit?

                                 ALICE
                        No. Yeah. Oh no.

           Lola turns around to see what Alice is looking at. Luke is 
           making his way over to them.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh my god.

                                 LUKE
                        Hi Alice. How are you?

                                 ALICE
                        Great, I just got back from a 
                        vacation.

           A leggy WOMAN, unconventionally beautiful and grounded, 
           sidles up next to Luke. Extends her hand to Lola.

                                 WOMAN
                        Hi, I’m Peggy.

                                 LOLA
                        What?

                                 LUKE
                        Excuse us a second.

           Luke becomes uncomfortable, takes Lola aside. Alice is left 
           with Peggy.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here? You said 
                        you weren’t coming.

                                 LOLA
                        I wasn’t, but then I felt like I 
                        should be able to support my 
                        friend, we’re adults. Who’s Peggy?

                                 LUKE
                        I’m sorry, I wouldn’t have brought 
                        her if I knew you were gonna be 
                        here. She’s just a friend from the 
                        gallery.
                                 LOLA
                        We didn’t talk about that.

                                 LUKE
                        You said you wanted to try taking a 
                        real break. I thought that’s what 
                        that meant.

                                 LOLA
                        Why would that be what that meant? 
                        No, no.

                                 LUKE
                        There’s no rules, how am I supposed 
                        to know where to draw the line?

                                 LOLA
                        So you’re dating her.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m not... I’m... okay, yes, I 
                        guess... I am. I’m just seeing 
                        where it goes. I don’t have any 
                        idea if I even like her. 

                                 LOLA
                        I thought you said you wanted to be 
                        “alone?”

                                 LUKE
                        I did. This... it just started to 
                        happen.

                                 LOLA
                        Did you know her when we were 
                        together?

                                 LUKE
                        Yes. But I never cheated on you. I 
                        promise. We only recently started 
                        hanging out.

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, I know, I read your text 
                        messages.

                                 LUKE
                        Are you serious? Why would you do 
                        that?

                                 LOLA
                        Don’t ask questions you already 
                        know the answers to.
                                 LUKE
                        I thought we had just started to 
                        build trust again.

                                 LOLA
                        You know Luke, to feel true passion 
                        you have to feel compassion. Maybe 
                        our passion was dead because you 
                        lost all compassion. And you turned 
                        selfish.

                                 LUKE
                        Woah, where was your compassion? 
                        Where is your compassion? If 
                        there's no room for selfishness in 
                        a relationship, that relationship 
                        is dead. You have to act selfishly.

                                 LOLA
                        I never did. I always put you 
                        before me.

                                 LUKE
                        Maybe that was the problem. 

           Lola walks back over to Alice, Luke follows.

                                 LOLA
                        Henry and I are dating, too. That’s 
                        why I’m here.

                                 ALICE
                        Tell it, sister.

                                 LUKE
                        Oh, yeah? Henry? Cool.

                                 LOLA
                        That doesn’t make you feel weird 
                        that I’m sleeping with your best 
                        friend?

           Luke swallows, hard, trying to play it cool.

                                 LUKE
                        Nah, I’m glad it’s him.

                                 ALICE
                        She’s not even into him and look 
                        how hot he is but whatevs it’s 
                        super cazh.
                                 LOLA
                           (very matter of fact)
                        I gotta go throw up, I’ll be right 
                        back.

                                 ALICE
                        Me too!

           They hurry off to the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER

           Lola and Alice stand at the mirror, Lola panicked, Alice 
           excited.

                                 ALICE
                        Are we really throwing up?

                                 LOLA
                        I think I’m having another panic 
                        attack.

                                 ALICE
                        Ech, he gives me the heebie jeebs, 
                        and by heebie jeebs I mean his 
                        scent is like pussy candy.

                                 LOLA
                        Of course he has a date.

                                 ALICE
                        So do you.

           We hear the band finish outside. Lola takes a deep breath.

                                 LOLA
                        Arite, let’s go. I’m fine. 

           INT. CLUB- MOMENTS LATER

           Henry stands at the bar. Luke stands next to him, awkwardly. 
           Alice and Lola notice as they make their way to the bar.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh no.

                                 ALICE
                        C’mon.
                                 LOLA
                        Maybe they’ll be gay together. Then 
                        I can kill two birds with one 
                        stone. 

                                 ALICE
                           (earnest)
                        Was that meant to be homophobic 
                        because you know my grandfather was 
                        into that shit, right?

           Cut to Luke and Henry at the bar. 

                                 LUKE
                           (to Henry)
                        When were you gonna tell me?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry, I’ve been meaning to...

                                 LUKE
                           (repressing anger)
                        No, that’s cool, it’s only my ex-
                        fiance.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry, dude. I know that’s 
                        shitty-

                                 LUKE
                        Did you sleep with her?

                                 HENRY
                        Let’s go outside and talk about 
                        this.

                                 LUKE
                        No, I’m fine right here.

           Lola and Alice approach. Lola bounces over to Henry.

                                 LOLA
                        Hey! You were so great. 

           She kisses him, Henry tries to dodge it. Alice stands next to 
           Peggy, staring up at her.

                                 ALICE
                        How do you get your hair like that? 
                        Egg? Egg yolks? To get the shine?
                                 PEGGY
                        The trick is to only wash your hair 
                        like once every two weeks. Natural 
                        oils are actually really good for 
                        it.

           Alice isn’t sure how to respond. 

                                 LOLA
                           (to Henry)
                        You were fabulous tonight. 

                                 HENRY
                        Thanks.

                                 LUKE
                        Your new “boyfriend” and I were 
                        just having a little chat.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh, cool, was it fun?

           Luke burns her with his glare. Lola turns to Henry.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna go.

                                 HENRY
                        Really?

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, I just feel a little weird.

           She looks to Luke, pointedly. He looks away.

                                 HENRY
                        You don’t have to. I mean, I get 
                        it, but-

                                 LOLA
                        No, I do, I mean, I’m gonna go. I’m 
                        sorry. I’ll call you tomorrow.

           She kisses him, which makes Luke uncomfortable, then whispers 
           to Peggy. 

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        He goes limp when he wears a 
                        condom. 

           And she’s out.
           INT. COOL CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Lola and Alice dance wildly together on the dance floor. Men 
           watch, but the ladies could care less. They’re having the 
           time of their lives.

           EXT. WILLIAMSBURG APARTMENT-LATER THAT NIGHT

           Lola drunkenly buzzes an apartment incessantly until we hear 
           a surprised Henry through the intercom.

                                 HENRY
                           (sleepily)
                        Hello?

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - EVEN LATER THAT NIGHT

           Lola is making out with Henry on his bed. She is sloppy 
           drunk, he is sober.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t bother calling.

                                 LOLA
                        I wanted to surprise you.

           She starts to unbutton his pants. Once they’re off, she 
           pushes him back onto the bed.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re-- hold on. You’re drunk. 

                                 LOLA
                        Shut up. Stop being so controlling. 

           His boxers come off. The sex is very tame. Henry is a timid 
           but gentle lover. It is clear that Lola is performing her 
           role rather than experiencing it. 

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Come on. What’s wrong?

                                 HENRY
                        Nothing.

           He’s about to orgasm, she fakes one, but pretty well. They 
           lay next to each other, catching their breath. After a 
           moment:
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                           (matter of fact)
                        So what do you sound like when you 
                        really cum?

           Lola is taken aback, embarrassed. She takes a beat to process 
           the question, and replies meekly.

                                 LOLA
                        Um. I don’t know... I’m quieter. I 
                        guess.

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Lola and Henry are getting dressed, awkwardly. 

                                 HENRY
                        Will you walk me to work?

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, of course.

           INT. STREET- LATER

           Lola and Henry walk down the street, holding hands. 

                                 LOLA
                        Can I ask you a question?

                                 HENRY
                        Anything.

                                 LOLA
                        Do you think we’re moving too fast?

                                 HENRY
                        No. I mean, I don’t know, do you?

                                 LOLA
                        I told Luke you were my boyfriend.

                                 HENRY
                        Did you just say that to make him 
                        mad or because you meant it?

                                 LOLA
                        I don’t know.

           Henry smiles.
                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        I’m just messed up right now. 

           They reach his office building, stop walking.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re not messing anything up.

                                 LOLA
                        Okay.

                                 HENRY
                        We don’t have to label anything. 
                        Let’s just be.

                                 LOLA
                        Okay, cool. I just don’t wanna 
                        worry about any rules. Or feel tied 
                        down or anything. 

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, me either. Unless you want to 
                        tie me up, then we can talk about 
                        rope selection.

           He kisses her, she kind of pulls away but also succumbs.

           INT. ACUPUNCTURIST’S OFFICE-DAY

           Lola lays on a futon on the ground in a dimly lit room. A 
           female ACUPUNCTURIST in her 40s crouches next to her, holding 
           Lola’s wrists, listening to her pulse. 

                                 ACUPUNCTURIST
                        How are your periods?

                                 LOLA
                        Okay. Sort of irregular.

                                 ACUPUNCTURIST
                        How old are you now, Lola?

                                 LOLA

                                 ACUPUNCTURIST
                        And you don’t have your period now?

                                 LOLA
                        No.
                                 ACUPUNCTURIST
                        Yeah, there’s a lot of movement 
                        happening hormonally for you. So 
                        that’s...

                                 LOLA
                        What?

                                 ACUPUNCTURIST
                        Totally natural. You know, you’re 
                        at the age where your body’s really 
                        gearing up for childbearing... is 
                        what’s happening. Doesn’t mean you 
                        have to have one, just means that’s 
                        the natural order.

                                 LOLA
                        Like, what, my hormones are getting 
                        domesticated, reading Real Simple, 
                        making time for hospital dramas? 

           The Acupuncturist begins to place needles in various spots on 
           Lola’s body.

                                 ACUPUNCTURIST
                        It’s funny you know with careers 
                        and lifestyles, we keep pushing our 
                        bodies to conceive later in life 
                        but it’s right now that your body 
                        instinctively wants to give birth.

                                 LOLA
                        My body does not want to give 
                        birth, I can tell you--Ow!

                                 ACUPUNCTURIST
                        That’s the heart meridian. 

                                 LOLA
                        Of course it is.

                                 ACUPUNCTURIST
                        And with your hormones in constant 
                        fluctuation, it’s going to get 
                        harder for you around 32, 33.

                                 LOLA
                        To get pregnant?

                                 ACUPUNCTURIST
                        If that’s something you want to do, 
                        yeah.
           INT. HEALTH FOOD STORE - NIGHT

           Health Food. Lots of it. Lola strolls the aisles. She picks 
           up one of those plastic bags from the dispensers. Has a very 
           difficult time finding the opening. 

           She picks up a Tin of Oysters. Holds it up to one of the 
           employees.

                                 LOLA
                        Who eats Oysters in a tin? 
                        Honestly, do these sell?

           She puts it back. She spends far too long in this store. It 
           is clearly a ritual of hers. 

           As she looks at a large variety of Dairy Alternatives, A CUTE 
           GUY (20s) smiles at her, looks away. She notices, continues 
           shopping. 

           He follows from a cautious distance. She tries to ignore his 
           gaze, but can’t help but be drawn back to him. They both end 
           up at the frozen food aisle. 

                                 CUTE GUY
                        Don’t do it.

                                 LOLA
                        Excuse me?

                                 CUTE GUY
                        Even though it’s organic, it’s 
                        still frozen.

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah. Too true.

                                 CUTE GUY
                        High in sodium. Cause it’s frozen. 
                        I’m Nick!

                        You shop here a lot?

                                 LOLA
                        I’m sorry I can’t be picked up 
                        right now. I appreciate the 
                        interest but I’m in a bad place.
                                 NICK
                        Gotcha. Well. I’d love to cook you 
                        dinner tomorrow night if you’re 
                        free. Not frozen. Alive. Well, not 
                        really alive you know what I mean. 
                        Recently killed that’s not 
                        frozen... Okay, I’m gonna just give 
                        you my number now. I’m sure you’ll 
                        never call it.

           He writes down a number on a piece of paper, hands it to her. 
           Walks away. She puts his number in her phone under “NICK 
           OYSTER.”

           INT. KAREN AND LENNY’S APARTMENT- DAY

                        It’s the twenty-first century! 
                        They’re making babies out of 
                        clones!

                                 KAREN
                        Why don’t you take a break darling 
                        and focus on school work.  

                                 LOLA
                        I can’t. I’m so bored of it. I 
                        can’t focus. 

                                 KAREN
                        Maybe you could meet a nice older 
                        man at NYU, date him, someone who 
                        is a little more settled than these 
                        immature school boys always on 
                        their phones, dicks hanging out, no 
                        attention span. 

                                 LOLA
                        How old?
                                 LENNY
                        70, 80.

           He starts laughing, Karen shushes him.

                                 KAREN
                        Just someone who can take care of 
                        you, who has a good head on their 
                        shoulders, who can afford to take 
                        you to fancy dinners, you need to 
                        be loved.

           Karen looks at Lenny.

                                 LENNY
                        Why are you looking at me? You’re 
                        saying we don’t go out? That 
                        Shawarma truck is romantic! (to 
                        Lola) If I were you, I would stick 
                        with the guy who makes you the 
                        happiest in this moment. 

                                 LOLA
                        That would be Don Draper.

                                 LENNY
                        Mad Men is a television show. Don 
                        Draper is a character on a 
                        television show. You are a human. 
                        Not on a television show. 

                                 KAREN
                        Wow. Who woke Einsten from the 
                        grave. (To Lola) Don Draper is a 
                        player, not the type you should be 
                        seeking. You’re asking to get hurt. 
                        What about Henry?

                                 LOLA
                        We’ve been friends for 10 years, 
                        I’m not that turned on by it.

                                 LENNY
                        Play the field, bunt and run, steal 
                        a base, get it done.

                                 LOLA
                        Are you rapping right now?
                                 KAREN
                        He’s trying to drop an album. (to 
                        Lenny) I told you to listen more to 
                        2Pac, you’re rhymes are too 
                        simplistic.

                                 LENNY
                        I’m a professor of the verse.

                                 KAREN
                        Holler at your boy.

           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT NIGHT

           We’re in a small but charming one bedroom in Hell’s Kitchen. 
           Lola and Nick eat a home-made dinner that he has cooked. She 
           stuffs her face with a cheeseburger.

                                 NICK
                        I was so happy when you told me 
                        you’d eat a cheeseburger. I’ve been 
                        dying to make one.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh I eat cheeseburgers! And lots of 
                        butter, too!

                                 NICK
                        Good. You never know with women.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh yeah, I’m not one of those 
                        insecure women who can’t eat any 
                        bread or nachos or chicken wings.

                                 NICK
                        Cause I’m totally Vegan, so didn’t 
                        want you to think you had to 
                        impress me or anything.

           He brings out Seitan for himself. Lola looks shocked.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I never really wanted to be 
                        an architect, it just kind of 
                        happened. 

                                 LOLA
                        That’s awesome. I like to think of 
                        myself as an architect of desire.
                                 NICK
                        You build people’s hopes and 
                        dreams.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh no, mostly like jungle shacks 
                        for the impoverished. 
                        Metaphorically speaking.

                                 NICK
                        So you’re a writer. What do you 
                        want to write about?

                                 LOLA
                        Cats.

                                 NICK
                        Cats?

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, like the history of cats.

                                 NICK
                        Meow.

                                 LOLA
                        No, I think eventually I’d like to 
                        write novels, but at the moment, 
                        it’s non-fiction. 

                                 NICK
                        Very sexy. Can I pour you another 
                        glass of wine?

           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Lola and Nick are half-naked. Hardcore make out sesh. He 
           reaches over to his bedside table, turns on his iPod.

           He gets on top of her, pulls his boxers down. From the look 
           on Lola’s face, we assume he has the biggest penis she has 
           ever seen.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh my god, your penis is bigger 
                        than a baby’s arm.

           Nick laughs uncomfortably, starts groping her.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, that just came out. 
                                 NICK
                        It’s okay, I know it’s freakishly 
                        big. I was an incubator baby.

                                 LOLA
                        What?

                                 NICK
                        The incubator made my penis bigger 
                        than other kids.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh.

                                 NICK
                        I’m kidding.

           The music kicks in. It is a slow folk song.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I have to tie it down 
                        with a small rope-

                                 LOLA
                        Shut up. Wanna get a condom?

                                 NICK
                        In a sec.

           He keeps the foreplay going. She tries to get into it.

                                 LOLA
                        Woah, that just slipped in there.

                                 NICK 
                        You feel so good. Just for a 
                        minute.

           Lola looks to the iPod dock.

                                 LOLA
                        Is this Ani DiFranco?

                                 NICK
                           (genuine)
                        Yes. She’s one of my favorite 
                        lyricists. 

           Lola looks at him blankly. He begins to sing to her.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I am watching your chest rise and 
                        fall, like the tides of my life,
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        and the rest of it all, and your 
                        bones have been my bedframe, and 
                        your flesh has been my pillow, I am 
                        waiting for sleep, to offer up the 
                        deep with both hands-

                                 LOLA
                        Right. Righteous Babe.

           He gets it in a bit. It feels good for both of them. She 
           doesn’t want to stop but knows she should.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, put on a condom.

                                 NICK 
                        You’re not on the pill?

                                 LOLA
                        It doesn’t matter.

                                 NICK 
                        What are you worried about?

                                 LOLA
                        I don’t know if you’re clean.

                                 NICK 
                        I am. I just got tested. Scout’s 
                        honor.

                                 LOLA
                        That’s supposed to make me feel 
                        better? Boy scouts?

                                 NICK
                        I’m actually an Eagle.

           He keeps going. Lola’s imagination kicks in. Nick is laughing 
           while giving another Eagle Scout a piggy back ride. We cut 
           back to Lola in reality, fighting pleasure, as Ani Difranco 
           wails in the distance.

           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Lola and Nick gather their things awkwardly, few words being 
           spoken.

                                 NICK
                        You sure you don’t wanna grab some 
                        breakfast? Fuckin’ omelette? I can 
                        be a few minutes late to work.
                                 LOLA
                        That’s okay, thanks.

           EXT. BUILDING - MORNING

           Lola and Nick walk out of his apartment onto the street. 
           Nick’s movement seems odd as Lola walks next to him. As they 
           stroll, the camera pulls out to reveal Nick gliding next to 
           her on a pair rollerblades. Lola walks timidly, weirded out.

                                 NICK
                        I had a really nice time with you. 

                                 LOLA
                           (feigning enthusiasm)
                        Yeah.

                                 NICK
                        Let me... roll you to the subway.

                                 LOLA
                        Uh... okay.

           They get to the end of the block. Suddenly Lola’s expression 
           turns to panic as she looks up to realize they are in front 
           of a building she recognizes. 

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit. This is-

                                 NICK
                        What?

                                 LOLA
                        Nothing, my friend... actually 
                        works here.

                                 NICK
                        Cool. Sweet architecture.

           They stand at the entrance to the subway.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call you.

           Nick rolls forward, kisses her on the lips. Lola cringes, but 
           kisses back. Without Lola noticing, Henry walks out of the 
           subway. He stops, flabbergasted. 

                                 LOLA
                        Henry.
           Henry is clearly seething.

                                 NICK
                        Hey, I’m Nick. Have a blessed day!

           He shakes Henry’s hand then gracefully skates away.

                                 LOLA
                        What...what are you doing here?

                                 HENRY
                        I work right here. What are you 
                        doing here?

           Lola looks around, trying to get her bearings.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh...I...um, I didn’t even realize 
                        where I was, I guess I was in my 
                        own world.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, clearly, you are in your own 
                        world. Did you just sleep with that 
                        dude?

                                 LOLA
                        ...um...

                                 HENRY
                        Oh my god, I cannot believe you.

                                 LOLA
                        Henry, I’m sorry, it was just, it 
                        was terrible if it’s any 
                        consolation, his dick was so big it 
                        hurt my back.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh he has a bigger dick than me 
                        too? What a consolation! You should 
                        get into the greeting card 
                        business! “Sorry I cheated on you, 
                        P.S. your dick is smaller!” 

                                 LOLA
                        That’s not what I meant.

                                 HENRY
                        I just assumed we were-

                                 LOLA
                        We are! Ugh! I’m confused...
                                 HENRY
                        Clearly.

           Henry turns around, walks down the block. She follows.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m easily persuaded these days, 
                        I’m vulnerable, I’m not myself-

                                 HENRY
                        So you’re saying I persuaded you to 
                        be with me?!

                                 LOLA
                        No, that was real. If anything I 
                        persuaded you!

                                 HENRY
                        Whatever.

                                 LOLA
                        We’re not exclusive or anything, I 
                        said no rules, I didn’t know if 
                        seeing other people was allowed-

                                 HENRY
                        It’s just common courtesy! It 
                        doesn’t have to be articulated! 

                                 LOLA
                        Henry, I know you’re angry, but you 
                        know what we are.

                                 HENRY
                        What are we?

           Lola doesn’t answer.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        WHAT ARE WE?!

                                 LOLA
                        Best friends...with benefits... 
                        Bestafits? 

           Henry takes this in, and then turns his back, and walks away. 
           Lola stands there, uncertain what to do.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Lola walks aimlessly down the street, giant bag of bulk 
           granola in hand. 
           She shovels handfuls into her mouth as she walks, leaving a 
           trail scattered behind her on the sidewalk. She picks up her 
           cellphone, dials.

                                 LOLA
                        Hey, you home?

           INT. LUKE’S APARTMENT- LATER

           Luke and Lola sit on either ends of his couch. 

                                 LOLA
                        I just was in the neighborhood.

                                 LUKE
                        That’s cool.

                                 LOLA
                        Do you have any weed?

           INT. LUKE’S APARTMENT- LATER

           Luke and Lola are blazed out of their minds, hysterically 
           laughing. Even they don’t know what exactly they’re laughing 
           about, but the release is intoxicating.

           INT. RESTAURANT BATHROOM - LATER

           Lola takes a pregnancy test in the bathroom of the 
           restaurant. She nervously waits for the result to appear. 

           Lola stares, then looks away. Her cell-phone vibrates. A few 
           texts from NICK OYSTER. She ignores them.

           She brings the test to the light, is it negative? 

           INT. RESTAURANT- MOMENTS LATER

           Lola walks up to Randy, pregnancy test in hand.

                                 LOLA
                        Randy--

                                 RANDY
                        Ew, are you fucking crazy that 
                        thing is like a walking toilet. 
                        Violation, violation.
                                 LOLA
                        I need you to tell me if this is 
                        negative.

                                 RANDY
                        Oh I’m like Ray Charles when it 
                        comes to straight people stuff. 
                        Retreat.

           Tears well in Lola’s eyes. Randy concedes.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Okay show me.

           Lola hands him the pregnancy test.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t touch me! Show me show me! No 
                        touching! Oh my god do I look like 
                        a Tampax factory?

                                 LOLA
                        Sometimes.

           Randy looks at the test.

                                 RANDY
                        Negative.

           Lola breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 LOLA
                        I don’t know why I do this to 
                        myself. It’s like I’m constantly 
                        attracted to men who punish me.

                                 RANDY
                        Prolly cause you need to be 
                        punished. I know a good B.D.S.M. if 
                        you want? 

                                 LOLA
                        I don’t need to pay someone to 
                        torture me. I’m like a Salvation 
                        Army for sadists. Come one, come 
                        all.

           INT. LOLA’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

           Lola stands in the bathroom putting on make-up. She can 
           barely bring herself to do it, but knows she has to. 
           She tries on a lipstick color, then rubs it off, re-applies. 
           The Woman next door plays the piano the whole time...

           Her cell-phone vibrates. She has a text from NICK OYSTER.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh my god, stop texting me!

           She ignores, and goes back to primping.

           INT. KAREN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Lola sits on the couch with Karen.

                                 KAREN
                        I’m glad you’re staying here for a 
                        few days. You need to get away from 
                        all that noise out there.

                                 LENNY (O.C.)
                        Fuck that noise!

           Lenny walks out wearing a weirdly patterned shirt.

                                 KAREN
                        Take that shirt off. What are you 
                        going to a Hindu Temple 
                        Celebration?

                                 LENNY
                        I got this in Peru, we bought it at 
                        Machu Picchu cause it made me look 
                        wise.

                                 KAREN
                        I didn’t say that. I never said 
                        that. You were tripping on mountain 
                        drugs. This doesn’t make you look 
                        wise, it makes you look impotent. 

                                 LENNY
                        THIS IS MY PARTY SHIRT. Where are 
                        my pants? Did you iron them?

                                 KAREN
                        You don’t iron silk pants. You 
                        steam them. Tell him, Lola.

                                 LOLA
                        I just put ‘em in the shower. Where 
                        is the Gallery Opening?
                                 KAREN
                        Where are all openings? Chelsea, 
                        honey. Do you want to come? Or do 
                        you want to waste your life?

                                 LOLA
                        I want to lie here and eat food 
                        from your fridge. And maybe have a 
                        party.

                                 KAREN
                        Anything to help you find 
                        direction. Unwind, take the 
                        pressure off. I know how hard it is 
                        when you’re a slut. Always seeing 
                        different men.

           Karen laughs, and Lola can’t help but join her.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        I love you so much. A lot of people 
                        do. 

                                 LOLA
                        I know.

           Lenny walks over, sits down next to Lola.

                                 LENNY
                        When you’re young everything feels 
                        life or death. Then you grow up and 
                        you look back on those decisions 
                        that caused you endless sleepless 
                        nights and you wish you would’ve 
                        slept. 

                                 KAREN
                        You slept through Nixon’s 
                        resignation! You’re practically a 
                        narcoleptic! 

           Karen pulls her close.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me, you’re searching 
                        right now, you know. In that in 
                        between place. It’s scary, but it 
                        can also be fun. It’s delicious, 
                        torment... 

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah...
                                 KAREN
                        You’ve got an incredible survival 
                        instinct, sweetie, you’re a New 
                        York kid, makes sense. But 
                        sometimes surviving means having 
                        the patience to not know. And to 
                        have fun. 

           INT. KAREN’S APARTMENT - LATER

           A huge party is underway. Twenty-something’s abound. Alice 
           stands by Lola’s side, texting furiously.

                                 ALICE
                        Okay, there’s at least 4 baby 
                        daddies here for you, and I just 
                        texted three more, one is a serious 
                        Krumper.

                                 LOLA
                        Great. Let’s just set up a gang 
                        bang and see who sticks.

           Lola checks her phone. 

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Ugh, that guy Nick won’t stop 
                        texting me. 

                                 ALICE
                        Monster dick Nick?

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, we slept together weeks ago. 
                        He thinks we’re dating. 

                                 ALICE
                        Invite him to the party!

           Alice leans in, conspiratorially.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, remember when you told me how 
                        there’s that brain chemical that 
                        releases when a woman orgasms?

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah. Oxytocin.

                                 ALICE
                        I found it. In a pill.
                                 LOLA
                        What?

                                 ALICE
                        No my friend was telling me he’s 
                        been taking it, you know like 
                        recreationally, which I thought was  
                        weird because dudes can get off 
                        just by looking at their own 
                        reflection, but I took it tonight.

           Lola looks at her for a moment. Putting it together. Then:

                                 LOLA
                        Alice! There is no pill form of 
                        Oxytocin. You took Oxy-COTIN. 

                                 ALICE
                        Same thing.

                                 LOLA
                        No! Different thing. Drug addict 
                        thing! Like heroine! That’s a 
                        really powerful narcotic!

                                 ALICE
                        Come to think of it, I have been 
                        feeling nauseous but often that’s 
                        the precursor to my orgasm so I was 
                        just going with it. 

                                 LOLA
                        Shit, Henry just showed up.

                                 ALICE
                        You invited him?!

                                 LOLA
                        I had to. I wanted to see him.

                                 ALICE
                        And he brought Luke?

                                 LOLA
                        I invited him, too.

                                 ALICE
                        And you think I’m the drug addict. 
                        See you on the other side.

           Alice turns around, falls flat on her face. Stands up, laughs 
           hysterically and starts dancing by herself. Lola avoids 
           Luke’s gaze, timidly walks over to Henry. 
                                 LOLA
                        Hey. 

                                 HENRY
                        Hey.

           An awkward beat.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m really glad you came.

                                 HENRY
                        ...Yeah. Me too. 

                                 LOLA
                        You sure?

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m sorry. For...

                                 HENRY
                        It’s all good.

                                 LOLA
                        Lack of clarity.

                                 HENRY
                        One might argue, pure clarity.

           INT. PARTY - LATER

           More people have showed up. Everyone is having fun. Alice 
           talks to Henry by the window.

                                 ALICE
                        What happened? She was a cutter?

                                 HENRY
                        How did you know that?

                                 ALICE
                        90210 taught me everything I know 
                        about being a woman.

                                 HENRY
                        That would explain some things.
                                 ALICE
                        In every woman, there is a Brenda, 
                        a Kelly, a Donna, hopefully minus 
                        the gaping boob hole, and an 
                        Andrea. Every woman is all of those 
                        women. Don’t you see?

                                 HENRY
                        What about Emily Valentine?

                                 ALICE
                        Minus the Top Gun jacket.

           Alice looks at Lola, talking to Luke across the room.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        She ain’t ready, dude, and I don’t 
                        know if that peach’ll ever be ripe.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah. I don’t got much fight left 
                        in me. Tired of the game.

                                 ALICE
                        You’re preaching to the choir.

           He smiles. Alice’s eyes widen, suddenly smitten. Across the 
           room, Lola is talking to Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        Sounds like a nice guy.

                                 LOLA
                        We’ve only gone out twice but he’s 
                        definitely courting me.

           Luke looks uncomfortable. He stands silently for a beat.

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t like him. 

                                 LOLA
                        ... Neither do I.

                                 LUKE
                        So get rid of him.

                                 LOLA
                        I gotta take what I can get.

                                 LUKE
                        You can get anyone. You’re Lola.
                         LOLA
                                                      LUKE
                                          Going okay.
           And how are you and that 
           girl?

           Luke nods uncomfortably as Lola quickly changes the subject.

                                 LOLA
                        So you and Henry are talking again?

                                 LUKE
                        Actually, he’s moving in with me.

           This takes Lola by surprise. Lola imagines a quick image of 
           Luke and Henry hanging out at their house with two beautiful 
           girls. She snaps back into reality.

                                 LOLA
                        Come again?

                                 LUKE
                        You know how desperately I’ve been 
                        looking for someone to sublet the 
                        spare room.

                                 LOLA
                        No. I didn’t know. 

                                 LUKE
                        I can’t really afford it anymore 
                        without you, but it’s too good a 
                        place to give up.

                                 LOLA
                        That is... yes. 

                                 LUKE
                        I would love for you to come over 
                        after he gets settled in. We could 
                        all hang out like old times.

                                 LOLA
                        Make sure I’m invited to the 
                        housewarming. 

                                 LUKE
                        We’re having one next Wednesday.

           INT. RESTAURANT-DAY

           Lola sits across from Nick Oyster. He looks at her sadly. She 
           takes a sip of her wine, and delivers the following monologue 
           completely genuinely, and a little off the cuff. 
                                 LOLA
                        I never wanted this for you. I work 
                        my whole life - I don't apologize - 
                        to take care of my family, and I 
                        refused to be a fool, dancing on 
                        the string held by all those 
                        bigshots. I don't apologize - 
                        that's my life - but I thought 
                        that, that when it was your time, 
                        that you would be the one to hold 
                        the string. Well, it wasn't enough 
                        time. It wasn't enough time.

           Nick stares at her blankly. Then:

                                 NICK
                        Did you just break up with me as 
                        the Godfather?!

           Lola pays the bill, starts putting on her jacket.

                                 LOLA
                        I'm a superstitious man, and if 
                        some unlucky accident should befall 
                        Michael - if he is to be shot in 
                        the head by a police officer, or be 
                        found hung dead in a jail cell... 
                        or if he should be struck by a bolt 
                        of lightning - then I'm going to 
                        blame some of the people in this 
                        room; and then I do not forgive. 
                        But with said, I pledge - on the 
                        souls of my grandchildren - that I 
                        will not be the one to break the 
                        peace that we have made today.

           She folds her napkin and walks gracefully out of the 
           restaurant. Nick, furious, yells after her.

                                 NICK
                        You’re out of your mind, you know 
                        that?!

           He slams his fist on the table. The Woman next to him gets 
           up.

                                 WOMAN
                        That sucks.
           INT. HYPNOTIST’S OFFICE-DAY

           Lola lays in a leather recliner, eyes closed. Her HYPNOTIST, 
           a smooth talking Irish man in his late 40s, sits by her side, 
           his hand on her arm, while speaking melodically in her ear. 

                                 HYPNOTIST
                        What is it you’d like to accomplish 
                        today in your trance?

                                 LOLA
                        ...I’d like to find...um...quiet. I 
                        just feel like my mind is just in 
                        crazy overdrive, and, and, I’m 
                        obsessing over everything, food, 
                        boys, I’m always distracted and I 
                        need to be writing, I’m just... 
                        unable to just be in the moment.

                                 HYPNOTIST
                        Then that’s exactly what we’ll work 
                        on. Being in the moment.

           The Hypnotist gets up, turns on a soft, New Age tune. Lola 
           closes her eyes for a few moments. It is truly peaceful, 
           albeit a little cheesy. Just then, Lola’s cell phone 
           vibrates.

                                 LOLA
                        Shit, sorry, lemme shut that off.

           In the process of shutting it off, she checks her text 
           messages. The Hypnotist sits and waits, annoyed.

           INT. CAB - NIGHT

           Lola and Alice both apply make-up in the backseat. It’s hard 
           to see because it’s so dark, so they hold their cell-phones 
           up to their faces to make sure they’re doing it correctly.

                                 LOLA
                        Do you have anything I can take 
                        that’s not liquid weed? I’m a 
                        stress case right now.

                                 ALICE
                        I have Klonopin, Clonazepam, 
                        Ativan, Alprazolam, and a Quaalude.  

                                 LOLA
                        In your purse?
                                 ALICE
                        In my pocket. You want what’s in my 
                        purse?

           She reaches into her purse.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m just all of a sudden insecure 
                        about seeing both my ex’s living 
                        together. It seems like the premise 
                        for a bad sitcom.

                                 ALICE
                        Yeah, let’s not go, let’s bail, I 
                        wanna go see Wicked. I heard it’s a 
                        musical the whole family can enjoy.

                                 LOLA
                        No, we’re going, I need to overcome 
                        my fear of being around them. Plus, 
                        I’m not into witches.

           INT. LUKE’S APARTMENT-THAT NIGHT

           A little housewarming party is under way. Lola and Alice 
           stand at the food table, eating everything in sight. Lola is 
           binging emotionally while Alice is just trying to keep up.

                                 ALICE
                        Why are we eating so much?

                                 LOLA
                        I don’t know if I can be here.

                                 ALICE
                        Does it make me look poor if I 
                        don’t eat the white outside on the 
                        brie?

           Luke walks over, sidles up next to Lola. 

                                 LUKE
                        Hey, Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        What up. Where’s Henry at?

                                 LUKE
                        Over there.

                                 ALICE
                        Gonna go say hi.
           Alice walks away. Lola looks on curiously.

                                 LUKE
                        You like the cheese.

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah.

                                 LUKE
                        So does your shirt.

           Lola looks down. Her shirt is covered in cheese. 

                                 LOLA
                        Where’s...?

                                 LUKE
                        Who?

                                 LOLA 
                        The leggy thing from the Gallery.

                                 LUKE
                        Peggy?

                                 LOLA
                        Peggy. Peggy sounds old.

                                 LUKE
                        No, she’s not old.

                                 LOLA
                        You date an old lady named Peggy. 

                                 LUKE
                        You do!

                                 LOLA
                        No, I date an old lady named Ruth.

                                 LUKE
                        Ruth, the gay geezer.

                                 LOLA
                        At least she’s Jewish.

                                 LUKE
                        Mine’s Quaker, we just raise our 
                        hands when we want to fuck.

           Lola desists, stung.
                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        You should talk to her. She’s cool.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh no, I don’t speak Na’vi.

           Alice comes back to the table with a glass of wine.

                                 ALICE
                        Peggy says you’ve neglected her 
                        long enough.

                                 LUKE
                        She loves you by the way.

                                 LOLA
                        You two have met?

           Alice doesn’t quite know what to say. As though timed, Henry 
           approaches. Flashes Alice a smile.

                                 HENRY
                           (to Alice)
                        Did you tell her?

           Henry knows exactly what he’s doing.

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about, Henry.

           Alice glares at him.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        So I was watching Chelsea Lately-

                                 LOLA
                        Tell me what.

                                 ALICE
                        It’s stupid, don’t worry about it.

           Alice snaps at Henry under her breath.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        We’re not doing this here.

                                 HENRY
                        Yes we are.

           Lola suddenly looks panicked. 
                                 LOLA
                        What is going on?

           Alice takes a deep breath.

                                 ALICE
                        Lo, we need to talk.

                                 LOLA
                           (piecing it together)
                        No.

                                 ALICE
                        It’s nothing. I mean it’s 
                        something, but it hasn’t become 
                        anything, I mean without me telling 
                        you first. Fuck, I’m such an 
                        asshole. Um. Shit.

           Lola screams a guttural cry. Alice looks frightened. As does 
           Henry. People turn around and stare. Luke walks over to 
           assess the situation.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god, Lo, not here. Listen to 
                        me. You didn’t want him. You said 
                        it yourself. And I didn’t go after 
                        this. It was an accident.

                                 LOLA
                        No, no, no, no.

                                 HENRY
                        I honestly didn’t think you’d react 
                        this way, you didn’t like me. What 
                        do you care who I--

                                 LOLA
                           (screaming to Henry)
                        It’s not about that!

                                 HENRY
                        What’s it about?!

                                 LOLA
                        You said you needed someone less 
                        neurotic! Less work! She’s a 
                        walking psych ward!

                                 HENRY
                        I never said that.
                                 ALICE
                        What?

                                 LOLA
                        Why didn’t you tell me any of 
                        this?! What am I the last to know?

                                 ALICE
                        No, we haven’t told anyone-

                                 LOLA
                        All you had to do was tell me that 
                        you had feelings for Henry and we 
                        could have talked about it-

                                 LUKE
                        Lola, can we go outside-

                                 LOLA
                        Shut up.

                                 ALICE
                        I wanted to tell you, I was just 
                        afraid. I knew you’d react like 
                        this.

                                 LOLA
                        I would’ve been fine if I wasn’t 
                        blindsided-

                                 ALICE
                        When do I ever have time to tell 
                        you things, you’re so wrapped up in 
                        your own shit-

                                 LOLA
                        Oh so you think I’m a narcissist 
                        now?! You don’t think I listen to 
                        all your bullshit?!

                         ALICE
           At least I’m aware that I’m 
           not alone in this world!
                                                      LOLA
                                          All your shit with that idiot 
                                          actor Roger! 

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        I am alone! You have left me alone! 

                                 ALICE
                        I never left you, I’ve been 
                        standing beside you every step of 
                        this godforsaken process, behind 
                        you every step, and the one time I 
                        step in front of you--
                                 LOLA
                        Is that what this is about? You 
                        being jealous of me?

                                 HENRY
                        Hey, hey- 

                                 LOLA
                        You left me just like she did.

                                 HENRY
                        You left us! 

                                 LOLA
                        What?! I came to you!

                                 HENRY
                        You haven’t hung out in years! Your 
                        relationship has sucked the life 
                        out of you!

           Just then Luke steps in.

                                 LUKE
                        I left you.

           Lola is dumbfounded.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        They didn’t leave you, I did.

           Lola is without a retort. She walks out, grabbing the brick 
           of cheese on the way.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER

           Lola walks into a liquor store in a rage. She grabs a bottle 
           of Johnny Walker Black. Instead of paying at the register, 
           she just throws some cash on the counter, and leaves. 

                                 WORKER
                        Hey! What the hell are you doing!? 
                        Get back here!

           EXT. STREET - SECONDS LATER

           Lola pops the cap off the Johnny Walker bottle and starts 
           chugging it. The Worker from the store chases after her.
                                 WORKER
                        You wanna go to jail, lady! You 
                        left me five dollars!

           He tries to grab her and she swings at him while making scary 
           cat noises. 

                                 WORKER (CONT’D)
                        Are you insane?

                                 LOLA
                        Hisssssssssssssssss. 
                        Hissssssssssssssss.

           She growls a bit more, then runs away.

           INT. STRIP CLUB - LATER

           Lola sits at the counter of a strip club, completely wasted. 
           Old geezers and shady men surround her, as she heckles the 
           dancers, while eating a plate of buffalo wings.

                                 LOLA
                        That’s right, girl, work that pole. 
                        Thrust up on iiiiiiit.

           She reaches into her pocket, pulls out a handful of crumpled 
           up dollars. The Men look at her like she is nuts.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Do you know how hard...work it is 
                        to do the pole...dance...like 
                        these. They’re... startsing an 
                        Olympic events...even... bet you 
                        didn’t know what.

           She beckons one of the Strippers over to her, shoves some 
           dollars into her Garter Belt. Then, happily helps herself 
           onto the stage.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Lemme get the pole.

           Just as she walks over to the pole, she whips around, and 
           grabs her plate of wings. She brings it to the stripper.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Here. Eat.

           The stripper declines, Lola continues to eat while she lazily 
           touches the pole with her leg.
                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Why did Jesse Spano do it, you 
                        know? Like what a great girl she 
                        was before she got hooked on the 
                        caffeine pills.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Get off the stage, bitch.

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, you like it dirty don’t you, 
                        you piece of shit. Don’t you, you 
                        disgusting pig? You don’t know the 
                        first thing about a woman’s needs.

           An OLDER MAN walks up to the stage to give her money.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Can I pay you to demean me, please?

           The Manager of the club comes on stage and carries her off. 
           She doesn’t go with out a fight, her legs gripping hard to 
           the pole as he pulls her upper body.

           EXT. STREET - LATER 

           Lola stumbles down the street, extremely drunk. We see a mash 
           up of all her fantasy sequences race through her mind. She 
           grasps for a railing to catch her balance, but instead pukes 
           on the ground.  She hobbles a little further along, then 
           collapses against a wall.

           A tear rolls down her face as sits slumped over, unable to 
           stand.

           INT. LOLA’S APARTMENT- MORNING

           Lola lies on the floor, her face buried in a pillow, a 
           package of frozen squash on her head, while Alice sits on the 
           couch. She is clearly in a state of misery. They sit in 
           silence for a while.

                                 ALICE
                        Do you want me to get you anything?

           She doesn’t respond. Then, after a moment:

                                 LOLA
                        Chips.
           Alice smiles, gets up, goes to the kitchen, finds a bag of 
           chips, and brings them back to her. Lola takes them, nestles 
           them under a pillow. Her face is still buried out of view, 
           but it seems she is feeding herself chips under there.

           Alice looks around the room, desperate for a conversation 
           that isn’t looking likely. Finally, Lola gestures with her 
           hand to come over to her.

           Alice goes and sits on the floor. Lola puts her arm around 
           her. They lie there together for a while.

           INT. RESTAURANT- DAY

           Lola sits behind the counter with Karen as Randy tends bar. A 
           BABY screams in a stroller.

                                 KAREN
                        I think that baby speaks for all of 
                        us.

           The Mother pushes the baby stroller out of the restaurant.

                                 LOLA
                           (laughing)
                        I can’t believe a year ago I was 
                        thinking about starting a family. 

                                 KAREN
                        Never too late to adopt an ethnic 
                        baby.

                                 LOLA
                        I need help.

                                 KAREN
                        No, you don’t, you just need time.

                                 LOLA
                        I don’t have time. I’m an adult, 
                        I’m supposed to have things figured 
                        out by now.

                                 KAREN
                        You know before I had you I felt 
                        the same way. There’s this 
                        assumption that as a kid you have 
                        questions, as a grown up you have 
                        answers. But it’s not true.

                                 LOLA
                        How is that not true?
                                 KAREN
                        There’s a certainty in innocence 
                        that gets lost as you mature. The 
                        real beauty of children is that 
                        they’re not embarrassed of not 
                        knowing. 

                                 LOLA
                        So I should just succumb to the 
                        possibility of failure? Give up on 
                        love?

                                 KAREN
                        No. Just stop wookin’ for wuv in 
                        all the wong pwaces.

                                 LOLA
                        Sadly, I think that means stop 
                        wooking for wuv at all.

                                 KAREN
                        Maybe. Maybe stop looking. For now. 
                        Let it find you.

           MONTAGE: Lola walking through Central Park. Lola laying on 
           the grass. Lola working out. Lola hanging with Henry. Lola 
           reading. Lola getting acupuncture, and actually enjoying it.

           INT. LOLA’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

           Lola sits at her computer, staring at a blank page. Only the 
           title is written: “Silence: Vocal Minorities and the Spiral 
           of Isolation”.

           All of a sudden, she starts rapidly typing. Ideas start 
           pouring out of her. She doesn’t stop until she has almost 20 
           pages written. She sits back, excited by her progress.

           INT. CLASSROOM - NYU - DAY

           Lola’s Professors sit before her as she reads from her 
           dissertation. 
                                 LOLA
                        In his final poem, A Throw of the 
                        Dice Will Never Abolish Chance, 
                        Mallarme writes of shipwreck, “that 
                        of the man without a vessel.” The 
                        typography of the page, clusters of 
                        words scattered among large 
                        expanses of white, mimic the lost 
                        soul of whom he speaks: “a solitary 
                        plume overwhelmed, untouched.” In 
                        these white expanses, he creates 
                        space for silence, a breath to 
                        process the pain of the crisis. For 
                        in this world of shipwreck, there 
                        is hope in an uncertainty of 
                        outcomes. “Nothing of the memorable 
                        crisis where the event matured,” 
                        Mallarme writes, “will have taken 
                        place...in this region of waves in 
                        which all reality dissolves.”

           INT. LUKE’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

           Henry, Alice, and Lola sit at her dining room table, eating 
           pasta.

                                 ALICE
                        Since when do you eat carbs? I love 
                        it.

                                 LOLA
                        It was my reward for finishing the 
                        first draft of my thesis. 

                                 HENRY
                        Congrats.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m a carbo loading dock. But you 
                        know what I learned, a little of 
                        what you don’t want can actually be 
                        good for you.

           Just then, Luke walks in with Peggy. Alice looks to make sure 
           Lola is cool.

                                 LUKE
                        Oh, hey. Didn’t realize there was a 
                        party going on, sorry. 
                                 ALICE
                        Don’t worry about it, we’re just 
                        bro’ing out over a little pasta.

           Lola and Luke’s eyes meet. They are both surprised to see 
           each other.

                                 LOLA
                        Hey.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey, Lo.

           She stands up, extends her hand to Peggy.

                                 LOLA
                        Hey Peggy, I’m Lola.

                                 PEGGY
                           (genuine)
                        Hi. I’ve heard a lot about you.

                                 LOLA
                           (smiling)
                        Uh oh.

                                 PEGGY
                        All good.

                                 LOLA
                        That’s awesome. Do you wanna join 
                        us for dinner?

                                 PEGGY
                        Sure, that would be great.

           EXT. FIRE ESCAPE- LATER

           Post-dinner. Alice and Lola stand on her roof, smoking a 
           joint together. They stare at the night sky.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m happy for you and Henry, I 
                        really am.

                                 ALICE
                        I’m so sorry I--

                                 LOLA
                        No, no. It’s fine. Don’t be sorry. 
                        I love you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOLA (CONT'D)
                        And I really want to thank you for 
                        being such a loyal friend to me. I 
                        know I don’t always show it, but I 
                        just want you to know how much I 
                        appreciate our friendship. 
                        Sometimes we take it for granted 
                        and I want you to know that I don’t 
                        anymore.

           They hug, tears in their eyes.

                                 ALICE
                        I love you, too. And if I wasn’t so 
                        stoned I’d try to match you but I’m 
                        just gonna say ditto.

           They laugh.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        The weird thing is, I feel like it 
                        took me meeting someone else to 
                        really see who I was.

                                 LOLA
                        You knew who you were before you 
                        met Henry. 

                                 ALICE
                        No, I know that’s not what I meant. 

                                 LOLA
                        You know, everyone always said 
                        before you can love someone else, 
                        you have to learn to love 
                        yourself... And after all this 
                        time... I don't think that's 
                        true... I think to love yourself 
                        you have to learn to love other 
                        people.

           INT. HUDSON RIVER PARK - AFTERNOON

           A giant outdoor picnic is underway on a great lawn in Battery 
           Park City.

           Alice and Henry are setting up food on a blanket, Karen and 
           Randy are smoking a joint together by a bush, laughing about 
           god knows what. There must be twenty or so people milling 
           about.

           The camera swoops around to Lola, who is telling a funny 
           story to five or six friends. She looks radiant as ever.
           Luke approaches her with a wrapped gift. She excuses herself 
           from the group, meets him halfway. 

                                 LUKE
                        Happy Birthday.

           He extends the gift to her. She takes it, unwraps it giddily. 
           Inside is a little black box. She looks up at Luke. He smiles 
           warmly. She opens the box. Inside is her wedding ring. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        They were out of Justin Bieber 
                        party hats so I figured this was 
                        the next best thing.

                                 LOLA
                        I can’t take this.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s yours. It’ll always be yours.

           Lola looks at him, serenely. A smile creeps up on her. He 
           smiles too.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Keepsakes are meant for keeping. 

                                 LOLA
                        Your fridge is gonna be so pissed 
                        at me.

                                 LUKE
                        I’ve got lo mein in there from 
                        1998, so it’s already pretty pissed 
                        in general.

           Lola laughs, then:

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, better to have loved and lost 
                        than never to have loved at all, 
                        right?

           Lola grins, mischievously.

                                 LOLA
                        We didn’t lose.

           Just then, Alice walks towards Lola, carrying a cake with 30 
           candles. They’re some janky ass candles, all blowing out, but 
           nobody cares.
           Lola swings around, smiling ear to ear. People form a big 
           circle around her. The cake says, “Happy 6th” on it.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Happy birthday to you, happy 
                        birthday to you, happy birthday 
                        dear Lola, happy birthday to you!!!

           She laughs, and blows out the half-lit candles. Everyone 
           claps and cheers as she blushes with embarrassment. She takes 
           a moment to gather herself, as she looks around at all of the 
           people she loves.

                                 LOLA
                        I just want to say thank you to 
                        everyone for coming out and for 
                        making me feel so special on what 
                        could have been a disastrously 
                        scary 30th birth date. So... have 
                        fun and please keep talking to me 
                        through my senility.

           Everyone laughs, claps again.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s eat this mothertruckin’ 
                        cake!

           People grab plates, and start cutting the cake. We hear a lot 
           of chattering, laughing, the noise of a party. 

           Lola steps  back, observes the group from a distance for a 
           moment. Then slowly tiptoes backwards, careful not to be 
           seen, and dips out of sight behind a tree. 

           We follow her as she walks past a cluster of trees, past the 
           running path, and out onto an old, wooden pier. As she does, 
           the sounds around her begin to fade.

           She walks to the far end. No one is around. She takes the 
           wedding ring out from her pocket, rubs it between her 
           fingers. Studies it, curiously. A slight smile crosses her 
           face, a decision being made in her mind. 

           She looks out over the Hudson. The sun is shining brightly, 
           the wind is blowing up the river, and finally, for the first 
           time in as long as she can remember, it is silent.

           THE END.

           End credits appear on the same giant concert size LCD screens 
           as the opening credits. The entire cast and crew comes on 
           stage and bows as their credit appears behind them.
