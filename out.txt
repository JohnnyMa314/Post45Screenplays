EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - DUSK

1

JUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript 
subdivision, facing the curb. It’s FALL. Juno is sixteen years 
old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces and shields 
her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object of her rapt 
attention is a battered living room set, abandoned curbside by 
its former owners. There is a fetid-looking leather recliner, a 
chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless latchhooked rug 
featuring a roaring tiger. 

JUNO V.O.

It started with a chair.

INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MOLD-O’-RIFFIC BASEMENT- NIGHT

FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow. He’s 
sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers 
herself onto his lap. 

A  60’s Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player. 

WHISPERED VOICE

Do you know how long I’ve wanted 
this?

JUNO

Yeah.

Wizard.

A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality.

JUNO

Quiet, Banana. Hey, shut your gob 
for a second, okay?

We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away 
from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again.

JUNO (V.O.)

This is the most magnificent discarded 
living room set I’ve ever seen. 

She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and 
wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.

Juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a 
jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of 
juice. We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly 
on a mission.

EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the 
main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk. 

The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno’s 
flushed serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice 
container over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of 
DROPOUTS with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.

She enters the DRUGSTORE.

INT. DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS

ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from 
behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest.

ROLLO

JUNO

Well, well. If it isn’t MacGuff the 
Crime Dog! Back for another test?

I think the last one was defective. 
The plus sign looked more like a 
division sign.

Rollo regards her with intense skepticism.

JUNO

I remain unconvinced. 

Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach.

ROLLO

This is your third test today, Mama 
Bear. Your eggo is preggo, no doubt 
about it! 

An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and 
lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle.

TOUGH GIRL

Three times? Oh girl, you are way 
pregnant. It’s easy to tell. Is 
your nipples real brown?

A pile of stolen COSMETICS falls out of the girl’s jacket and 
clatters to the floor.

TOUGH GIRL

Balls!

Juno crosses and crosses her legs awkwardly, hopping. It’s 
obvious she has to use the bathroom urgently.

Rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down 
one of the aisles.

Maybe you’re having twins. Maybe 
your little boyfriend’s got mutant 
sperms and he knocked you up twice!

ROLLO 

JUNO

Silencio! I just drank my weight in 
Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto. 

ROLLO

Well, you know where the lavatory is.

(Calling after her) )

You pay for that pee stick when 
you’re done! Don’t think it’s yours 
just because you’ve marked it with 
your urine!

Jesus, I didn’t say it was.

JUNO

ROLLO

Well, it’s not. You’re not a lion 
in a pride!

(to himself)

These kids, acting like lions with 
their unplanned pregnancies and 
their Sunny Delights.

INT.  DRUGSTORE - BATHROOM - DAY

In the dim, reeking public bathroom, Juno hovers over the 
commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles. She clumsily 
tries to use the pregnancy test.

We see the test box sitting on the sink. It’s a TeenWave 
Discount Pregnancy Test. The accompanying outdated package 
photo is of a shrugging 80s teen with a resigned expression. 
The fine print on the box reads “From the makers of Sun-Glitz 
Lightening Hair Spritz!”

INT. DRUGSTORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY

9

Juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the open 
test box on the front counter. Rollo scans it and bags it 
indifferently.

JUNO

Oh, and this too.

She places a giant licorice Super Rope on the counter.

So what’s the prognosis, Fertile 
Myrtle? Minus or plus? 

ROLLO

JUNO

(examining stick) I don’t know. 
It’s not...seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. 
Yeah, there’s that pink plus sign 
again. God, it’s unholy.

ROLLO

That ain’t no Etch-a-Sketch. This 
is one doodle that can’t be undid, 
homeskillet.

She shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the 
results. Shake. Shake. Nothing.

10

EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING

Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, 
gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super Rope 
over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to fashion 
a noose.

Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of 
prairie grass and wild flowers.

you have a big lunch?

It’s not a food baby. I took three

How did you even generate enough

I drank like ten tons of Sunny

pregnant. And you’re shockingly 
cavalier. 

Is this for real? Like for real, 
for real?

Unfortunately, yes.

Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket 
Thailand!

That’s the kind of emotion I was 
looking for in the first take.

Well, are you going to go to 
Havenbrooke or Women Now for the 
abortion? You need a note from your 
parents for Havenbrooke.

I know. Women Now, I guess. The 
commercial says they help women now.

Want me to call for you? I called 
for Becky last year.

Eh, I’ll call them myself. But I do 
need your help with something very 
urgent.

EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT

Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well-
manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team.

That is sick, man.

Leah busts a gut laughing. It’s a stunningly accurate 
portrayal of Bleeker’s parents.

So, you were bored? Is that how 
this blessed miracle came to be?

Nah, it was a premeditated act. The 
sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.

When did you decide you were going 
to do Bleeker?

Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.

Bleeker and Juno are sitting at their desks, listening to a

floor, reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the 
teacher obediently.

She hefts a coffee table with her bare hands. She’s wearing

It’s extremely complicated, and I’d

PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for 
early morning track practice. He wears a cross country 
uniform that reads “DANCING ELK CONDORS.” He is eating some 
kind of microwaved snack gimmick.

Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting 
for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the 
front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe 
officiously.

JUNO

Hey Bleek.

BLEEKER
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.

Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.

I don’t know...

JUNO

I’m pregnant.

BLEEKER

I guess so. 

(fidgeting)

What are you going to do?

Stunned silence. Juno pops up the footrest of the recliner 
and leans back comfortably.

The Dancing Elk Prep cross country team runs past Bleeker’s 
house in a thundering herd, wearing a motley assortment of 
warm-ups. Their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves. 
They wave and holler at Bleeker and Juno.

JUNO V.O.

When I see them all running like 
that, with their things bouncing 
around in their shorts, I always 
picture them naked, even if I don’t 
want to. I have intrusive thoughts 
all the time.

JUNO

I thought I might, you know, nip it 
in the bud before it gets worse. 
Because I heard in health class that 
pregnancy often results in an infant. 

BLEEKER
Yeah, typically. That’s what 
happens when our moms and teachers 
get pregnant.

So that’s cool with you, then?

Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do 
what you think is right.

JUNO

BLEEKER

JUNO

I’m real sorry I had sex with you. 
I know it wasn’t your idea.

BLEEKER

I’ll see you at school, O.K.?

She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off.

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Juno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with 
photos of Leah and Bleeker, plus a giant poster of Iggy Pop 
in his heyday.

She grabs a dilapidated physics textbook. A few pages slip 
out. STEVE RENDAZO (the same asshole who harassed her as she 
walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway.

He high-fives his klatch of buddies and moves along.

STEVE RENDAZO

Hey, your book fell apart!

JUNO

Yeah.

STEVE RENDAZO
It must have looked at your face. 
PWAH!

JUNO V.O.

The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo 
secretly wants me. Jocks like him 
always want freaky girls. Girls with 
horn-rimmed glasses and vegan 
footwear and Goth makeup. Girls who 
play the cello and wear Converse All-
Stars and want to be children’s 
librarians when they grow up. Oh 
yeah, jocks eat that shit up. 

JUNO V.O.

They just won’t admit it, because 
they’re supposed to be into perfect 
cheerleaders like Leah. Who, 
incidentally, is into teachers.

We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with 
mixed feelings.

We see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly 
with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH.

LEAH
(from a distance)
Me too! I love Woody Allen!

STUDENTS bustle in, as the teacher, MR. TINKER tries to 
maintain order. Juno heads toward her desk and sets down her 
bag.

MR. TINKER

People! We’re doing our 
photomagnetism lab today, so find 
your partner and break out into 
fours. 

Juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner: 
Bleeker. Sound the gong of awkwardness!

Juno and Bleeker head separately over to an available lab 
station and unpack their bags in silence.

He slides a piece of graph paper in front of Juno without 
looking at her.

answers if you need to. 

Oh, I couldn’t copy your work.

But you copy my work every week.

Oh yeah. I’m kind of a deadbeat lab 
partner, huh?

I don’t mind. You definitely bring 
something to the table.

Or something.

The other two LAB PARTNERS, a humorless couple, join them at

Amanda, I told you to go to the 
infirmary and lie down. You never 
listen.

GIRL LAB PARTNER

No Josh, I don’t take orders. Not 
from you and not from any man. 

GUY LAB PARTNER
You know, you’ve been acting like 
this ever since I went up to see my 
brother at Mankato. I told you, 
nothing happened!

GIRL LAB PARTNER

Something happened. Because your 
eyes? Are very cold? They’re very 
cold, Josh. They’re cold, lying eyes. 

GUY LAB PARTNER

What? My eyes are not lying!

GIRL LAB PARTNER
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, 
they have been lying eyes.

BLEEKER

Okay...I’m going to set up the 
apparatus. Juno, want to get a C-
clamp out of that drawer?

GIRL LAB PARTNER
I’m going to the infirmary.

Good. Call me when you’re OFF the 
rag.

Juno and Bleeker observe the argument like tennis spectators, 
fascinated by the dynamics of a real couple.

GUY LAB PARTNER

Good, I’ll be sure to do that, 
Amanda. I’ll make a note of it.

He furiously scrawls a fake memo in his notebook.

JUNO

Snow Peak Peach is the best flavor 
of Boone’s. Right, Bleek?

Bleeker reddens and continues constructing the apparatus.

Bleeker shakes his head and rifles through his textbook.

Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper that depicts a 
distraught TEEN GIRL clutching her head in a moment of staged 
conflict. The ad reads: “Pregnant? Find the clinic that gives 
women choice. Women’s Choice Health Center.”

Juno picks up her hamburger phone and dials. For a moment, 
she attempts to copy the melodramatic pose from the ad, 
checking herself out in the mirror.

(talking along with voice prompt) 
“Para instruciones en Espanol, 
oprima numero dos.”

She presses a few buttons in succession.

JUNO

JUNO

Yes, hello, I need to procure a hasty 
abortion?...What was that? I’m sorry,

PUNK RECEPTIONIST

Would you like some free condoms? 
They’re boysenberry.

JUNO
No thank you. I’m off sex.

PUNK RECEPTIONIST
My partner uses these every time we 
have intercourse. They make his 
balls smell like pie.

JUNO

Congrats. 

She takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a 
pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of 
“mommy mags” and health related periodicals. She selects an 
issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few 
moments.

Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby 
teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her 
thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.

Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting 
woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. 

Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist 
clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on 
her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their 
fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...

CUT TO:

PUNK RECEPTIONIST

Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?

There’s no answer. We see that Juno’s chair is EMPTY.

The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door 
drift shut. Juno’s figure recedes into the distance as she 
tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.

What are you doing here, dumbass? I 
thought I was supposed to pick you 
up at four.

I couldn’t do it, Leah! It smelled 
like a dentist in there. They had 
these really horrible magazines, 
with, like, spritz cookie recipes and 
bad fiction and water stains, like 
someone read them in the tub. And the 
receptionist tried to give me these 
weird condoms that looked like grape 
suckers, and she told me about her 
boyfriend’s pie balls, and Su-Chin 
Kuah was there, and she told me the 
baby had fingernails. Fingernails! 

Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the 
baby’s claws could scratch your vag 
on the way out?

JUNO
I’m staying pregnant, Le.

Keep your voice down dude, my mom’s 
around here somewhere. She doesn’t 
know we’re sexually active.

What does that even mean? Anyway, I 
got to thinking on the way over. I 
was thinking maybe I could give the 
baby to somebody who actually likes 
that kind of thing. You know, like 
a woman with a bum ovary or 
something. Or some nice lesbos.  

But then you’ll get huge. Your chest 
is going to milktate. And you have to 
tell everyone you’re pregnant.

I know. Maybe they’ll canonize me 
for being so selfless.

Bleeker and I were going to go to 
Gettysburg for spring break. 

Well, maybe you could look at one 
of those adoption ads. I see them 
all the time in the Penny Saver.

There are ads? For parents?

Oh yeah! “Desperately Seeking 
Spawn.” They’re right by the ads 
for like, iguanas and terriers and 
used fitness equipment. It’s 
totally legit.

Come on, Leah. I can’t scope out

They turn the pages in silence for a moment. Their lips and

We should put it in Bleeker’s yard.

You’re not listening to me. 

No, I heard you. I just can’t give 
the baby to people who describe 
themselves as “wholesome.” I’m 
looking for something a little 
edgier.

What did you have in mind, a family 
of disturbed loners who are into 
gunplay and incest?

I was thinking a graphic designer, 
mid-thirties, and his cool Asian 
wife who dresses awesome and plays 
bass. But I’m trying to not be too 
particular.

All right, how about this one? 
“Healthy, educated couple seeking 
infant to join our family of five. 
You will be compensated. Help us

Yeesh, they sound like a cult.

Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening 
to the same LP from when he and Juno went all the way.

He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep 
yearbook.

We see the object of his gaze is Juno’s black and white 
YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten 
message from Juno. We hear Juno’s voice reading the message:

JUNO V.O.

Hey Bleeker! Spank off to this with 
motion lotion. Just kidding (kind 
of.) Your best friend, Juno.

Bleeker picks up the phone. It’s the same HAMBURGER PHONE 
Juno has. He reconsiders and puts it down.

There’s a knock on the bedroom door.

BLEEKER’S MOM pokes her dowdy head inside.

BLEEKER’S MOM
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to 
eat?

Bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach.

BLEEKER’S MOM
Juno MacGuff called while you were 
out running. She wants to know if 
you’re coming to her little 
coffeehouse performance on Saturday.

BLEEKER

Thanks for the message.

BLEEKER’S MOM

You know how I feel about her.

BLEEKER

You’ve mentioned it about fifty 
times. 

BLEEKER’S MOM
I just hope you don’t consider her 
a close friend.

Bleeker’s mom gives up and closes the door.

hand, which he slowly releases as the 45 ends.

Bren and Mac are predictably speechless.

We found them in the Penny Saver by 
the exotic birds section. 

But they have a real lawyer and 
everything. I’m going to meet with 
them next weekend.

Junebug, that is a tough, tough 
thing to do. Probably tougher than 
you can understand right now.

Well, I’m not ready to be a mom.

Damn skippy, you’re not! You don’t

You’re made of stronger stuff than

First things first, we have to get 
you healthy. You need prenatal 
vitamins. Incidentally, they’ll do 
incredible things for your nails, so 
that’s a plus. Oh, and we need to 
schedule a doctor’s appointment. Find 
out where you’re going to deliver.

The term “deliver” is so weird. Can 
we not say “deliver”?

How does “crap it out” sound?

Juno, I want to come with you to

MACHINE sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room.

MARK

JUNO

‘93. I’m telling you that was the 
best time for rock and roll.

Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1.
You weren’t there, so you can’t 
understand the magic.

MARK
You weren’t even alive!

MAC
So. What’s that thing?

VANESSA
A Pilates machine?

What do you make with that?

You don’t make anything. It’s for

questions. 

VANESSA

Juno, we’d really appreciate it if 
you could keep us updated on any

other things of that nature.

Oh. Sure. Of course you’d want to

Oh really?

Look, if I could give it to you now,  
I would. But it probably looks like a 
Sea Monkey at this point, so I think 
we should leave it in there for a 
while until it gets cuter, you know?

I think that’s a great idea.

Sonic Youth doing “Superstar” by

rip a copy for you before you 
leave.

You don’t have to do that.

It’s the least I can do. What did

God, pretentious much? I guess 
everyone should have a mysterious 
name like Juno, huh?

My dad went through this phase 
where he was obsessed with Greek 
and Roman mythology. He named me 
after Zeus’s wife. I mean, Zeus had 
other lays, but I’m pretty sure 
Juno was his only wife. She was 
supposed to be really beautiful but 
really mean. Like Diana Ross. 

MARK
That suits you.

Uh, thanks. 

You know, not many teenage girls in 
your situation would actually go

Bleeker’s mom escorts Juno wordlessly up the stairs and down 
the hallway to Paulie’s bedroom. Juno discreetly tries to 
charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her 
from getting past Bleeker’s mom. They share an extremely 
awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway. 

Bleecker’s mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker’s 
bedroom door. The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration 
hanging on it that says PAULIE’S VRROOOM! It looks like 
something a 5-year old might have.

INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes, studying 
like the tortured brainiac he is. Mrs. Bleeker opens the 
bedroom door. Juno appears. Paulie jumps, startled.

JUNO

Hey, don’t concentrate so hard, 
man. I think I smell hair burning.

Bleeker smiles faintly.

BLEEKER’S MOM

Ten minutes.

She closes the door halfway and leaves. Juno rolls her eyes 
and pulls the door shut entirely.

What’s up?

BLEEKER

JUNO

I just wanted to come over. You 
know, say hi. I miss hanging out 
with you on school nights.

BLEEKER

I miss it too.  

Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleeker’s one 
and only vice. 

JUNO V.O.

He nervously cracks open a container of ORANGE TIC-TACS and 
pours them into his mouth.

Bleeker glances at Juno’s midsection, embarrassed.

Bleeker is visibly relieved.

So, it looks like you’re getting 
pregnant-er these days.

BLEEKER

JUNO

Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole 
private adoption thing. These 
married people in Saint Cloud are 
going to be the parents.

BLEEKER
Really? What are they like?

JUNO

The guy is super cool! His name is 
Mark and he’s into old horror 
movies and he plays guitar. I 
actually hung out with him today.

BLEEKER

Is that normal?

JUNO

I asked my dad and Bren not to narc 
us out to your folks, so we should 
be safe.

BLEEKER

Oh. That’s a relief.

JUNO

I’m going to really start looking 
like a dork soon. Will you still 
think I’m cute if I’m huge?

Juno is caught off guard by his sincerity.

JUNO
Jesus, Bleek. 

BLEEKER

Well, I do. 

The song playing ends, and another one begins. It’s “the 
song,” the track that Bleeker and Juno both recognize from 
the infamous night in the basement.

Bleeker picks at the carpet, dejected.

BLEEKER

Hey Junebug, when all this is over 
we should get the band back 
together again.

JUNO

Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new 
drumhead we should be good to go.

BLEEKER

We could get back together too.

JUNO

Were we together?

Well, we were once. You know, that time.

BLEEKER

JUNO

What about Katrina De Voort? You 
could go out with Katrina De Voort.

BLEEKER

I don’t like Katrina.

JUNO
I totally heard you did.

BLEEKER

I don’t. Katrina smells like soup. 
Her whole house smells of soup.

Mark and Vanessa stand silently in the nursery. The walls are

corner. Vanessa beams proudly and holds two paint samples up 
near the wall.

VANESSA

What do you think? Custard or 
Cheesecake? 

MARK
They’re yellow.

VANESSA

Well, I wanted to pick something 
gender-neutral for now. Once we get 
the baby, God willing, we can 
create a more decisive palette. 

MARK

Why do people think yellow is 
gender-neutral? I don’t know one 
man with a yellow bedroom.

VANESSA

I think I’m leaning toward Custard 
in this light. I don’t know. I 
should paint a small area...

MARK

Or you could just wait a couple 
months. It’s not like the baby’s 
going to storm in here any second 
and demand dessert-colored walls.

VANESSA

What to Expect says that readying the 
baby’s room is an important process 
for women. It’s called “nesting.”

MARK

Nesting, huh? Are you planning to 
build the crib out of twigs and 
saliva?

I just think it’s too early to

Mark shrugs, resigned.

Vanessa points to the nursery’s largest wall.

That wall is going to need 
something. Maybe we could put our

They’re watching a group of well-heeled women and their 
children shopping en masse. One of the women is pushing a 
toddler in an ultramodern stroller. And one of the women is 
VANESSA, looking vaguely detached.

WOMAN #2
Especially not with her build.

JUNO

Peanuts-style)

Wah-wah-waaah!

The women gather near a play area, sip Frapps and loudly 
discuss their outfits for an upcoming party.

One of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa’s 
sleeve. Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their 
play area and begins to play energetically with her.

Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces.

Vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the 
courage for an unusual request.

VANESSA

is always grabbing at my belly. I’m

She grabs Vanessa’s hand and plants it on her stomach.

Like I’d marry you! You would be the

I know you weren’t bored that day

going to finally be happy, and 
everything will be all right. 
Believe me on this one! 

A baby is not going to fix 
everything. Besides, I don’t know if 
I’m ready to be a father.

JUNO

(aghast)
But you’re old!

I...How do you think of me, Juno? 
Why are you here?

I don’t know. I just liked being your 
friend. I sort of liked becoming 
furniture in your weird life.

This...

MARK (cont'd)

...this is what my life has become. 
Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. 
Is that so appealing to you?

Yeah, I guess...Is this my fault? Is 
Vanessa mad at you because of me?

That’s not the point. We’re just 
not in love anymore.

Yeah, but didn’t you love Vanessa 
when you married her? If you love 
someone once, you can love them 
again, I know it. My friend Leah has 
gone out with the same guy, like, 
four times. You’re just not trying.

Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is - a teenage girl.

I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe 
what an idiot I am. 

He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.

Please don’t get a divorce! God, 
Mark, just do me a solid and stay 
with your wife.

God, you’re so young.

Not really. I’m sixteen. I’m old 
enough to tell when people are 
acting like total a-holes!

Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at 
Mark.

Oh and by the way, I bought another 
Sonic Youth album and it’s the 
worst thing I’ve ever heard! It’s 
just noise, man!

She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.

Juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the 
front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who’s 
returning home from work, carrying her briefcase and a 
freshly purchased NURSING PILLOW. They nearly collide.

It’s obvious from Juno’s tears and flushed face that she’s 
lying. Vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries 
her hardest to seem serene and “together” in front of Juno.

VANESSA

Juno? What’s going on? 

JUNO

Nothing.

VANESSA

(pretending to be calm)

Mark? Why is Juno crying?

JUNO

I’m not crying. I’m allergic to 
fine home furnishings. See you 
later.

She rushes toward the door.

VANESSA

Hold on.

Juno halts.

VANESSA

Juno, what’s the matter?

MARK

She’s hormonal. Right, June? It’s 
just part of the whole process.

Juno looks totally betrayed. She doesn’t respond. Vanessa 
looks at Juno’s expression and knows Mark is lying.

VANESSA

What did you do?

I didn’t do anything... I just... 
I’ve just been thinking.

MARK

I know we’re prepared. I just don’t

Juno’s face continues to fall. Vanessa notices.

Juno ain’t buying it.

VANESSA

(to Juno)

Juno, don’t worry about this. He just 
has cold feet. That’s how boys are. 
The books all say the same thing. A 
woman becomes a mother when she gets 
pregnant. A man becomes a father when 
he sees his baby. He’s going to get 
there. He’ll get there.

VANESSA (CONT’D)

(to Mark)

Why don’t we let Juno go home and we 
can discuss this later on, okay?

MARK

It all just happened so fast. We 
put that ad in the paper. I thought

It just feels a little like bad

What would be a good time for you?

I don’t know. There’s just things I 
still want to do.

VANESSA

MARK
Don’t mock me.

Vanessa sighs. It’s done.

VANESSA

You’re trying to do something that’s 
never going to happen. And you know 
what? Your shirt is stupid. Grow up. 
If I have to wait for you to become 
Kurt Cobain, I’m never going to be a

Vanessa looks defeated.

I never said I’d be a great father.

We hear the front door closing. Vanessa and Mark look over

but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.

EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the 
shoulder.

INT. PREVIA - AFTERNOON

Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for 
the first time since she became pregnant. 

After a beat, she begins to gather herself.

INT. BLEEKER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar. 
He’s playing a theme that we will soon recognise.

EXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT

Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her 
future. We push in close... when she gets an idea.

She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she 
finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and 
pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?

EXT. LORING HOUSE - NIGHT

It’s quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting 
alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of 
wine.

Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events sink

She buries her head in her hands.

MARK
I know you did.

There’s a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.

EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT  

Mark opens the door. There’s a folded piece of paper sitting 
on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the 
van.

Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper--it takes a minute 
because of Juno’s proficiency in “teen girl origami.” He 
holds it up. We can see there’s WRITING on the back.

been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.

JUNO V.O.

I never realize how much I like being 
home unless I’ve been somewhere 
really different for a while.

She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch and 
sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly with it. 
Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.

Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth

accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared 
out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he’s 
not sure what to say.

He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game, 
but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His 
expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained.

MAC

Someday, you’ll be back here, 
honey. On your terms.

Juno nods and swallows.

Over Mac’s shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway. 
It’s Bleeker in his track uniform. 

Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. Mac 
glances at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac 
clears his throat, gets up and leaves the room.

Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his 
arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for 
the first time in months.

It ended with a chair.

We pan past the wall Vanessa had said “needed something.” 
There’s a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was 
handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it 
says: “Vanessa - If you’re still in, I’m still in. Juno.”

We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa’s bedroom. We 
see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her 
shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa 
looks disorganized, unshowered--and incredibly happy. There 
are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet 
pushed close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn’t been away from 
the baby for a single moment. 

The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa’s thumb. Vanessa glows 
with an expression of pure bliss.

smiles and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker 
and pulls the pick out of the strings.

JUNO

Ready?

Bleeker nods.

Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing “Anyone Else But 
You,” by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first their 
playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.

BLEEKER

You’re a part time lover and a full-
time friend. The monkey on your 
back is the latest trend.

BLEEKER (cont'd)
I don’t see what anyone can see, in 
anyone else but you.

JUNO

Here is the church and here is the 
steeple. We sure are cute for two 
ugly people. I don’t see what anyone 
can see, in anyone else but you.

BLEEKER

We both have shiny happy fits of 
rage. You want more fans, I want 
more stage. I don’t see what anyone 
can see, in anyone else but you.

JUNO

You are always trying to keep it 
real. I’m in love with how you 
feel. I don’t see what anyone can 
see, in anyone else but you.

BLEEKER

I kiss you on the brain in the shadow 
of a train. I kiss you all starry-
eyed, my body’s swinging from side to 
side. I don’t see what anyone can 
see, in anyone else but you.

JUNO

The pebbles forgive me, the trees 
forgive me. So why can’t you 
forgive me? I don’t see what anyone 
can see, in anyone else but you.

JUNO AND BLEEKER TOGETHER
Du du du du du du dudu. Du du du du 
du du dudu. I don’t see what anyone 
can see, in anyone else but you.

She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile 
ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.

Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with 
life and summer activity.
